                <p>MICHAEL E. C. ELY</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 9, 1993</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could give me a little about your
                        background, when and where you were born and raised and educated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: My father and his father before him were West Pointers, and my uncles all
                    went to West Point as well, so I come from of an old Army family and was raised
                    at Army posts. My father taught ROTC at Princeton back in the '30s and got the
                    idea of sending me there. I was nearsighted and couldn't get into West Point, so
                    it was clear I was not to have a military career. So I went to Princeton
                    instead, where I went to the Woodrow Wilson School and studied international
                    affairs. I thought I was going to be an engineer when I got to Princeton, and
                    then I found that my math wasn't strong enough. I was interested in history, so
                    I majored in international affairs, substantially in history, which I liked very
                    much.</p>
                <p>And right after university, I went in as a second lieutenant of artillery during
                    the Korean War. I was actually drafted into the antiaircraft, in which I had no
                    background, and spent a miserable 21 months on the mud flats outside of New York
                    City, in a would-be air defense in case the Russians came over the Pole on a
                    suicide mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I take it, though, that since New York still stands
                        in 1992, essentially your mission was successful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: We were on the wrong side of the city, south of it, so the Russians would
                    have had to come in the other way. But I guess, after they dropped their bombs,
                    we could get even by shooting them down with our 90-mm antiaircraft guns.</p>
                <p>After that, I had my first and only experience with the private sector, when, in
                    1954, I went to work for a bank in New York as a trainee who didn't enjoy it
                    very much.</p>
                <p>Had the opportunity of taking the Foreign Service exam. They were recruiting in
                    '55, after having closed down for a year in the wake of the McCarthy harassment.
                    I passed the written examination handily. They were looking for people so I got
                    through the oral quickly.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the three-and-a-half-day exam, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: That was the last of the three-and-a-half-day examinations. I didn't find it
                    all that difficult myself. I think probably the kind of education I had gave me
                    an advantage, because somebody who was as good as I was and didn't have the same
                    education wouldn't have done as well. I joined and moved back to Washington. I
                    was born in Washington and had lived there, so it was a city I knew. And found,
                    to my surprise, that I was put in Personnel. While I was working in the New York
                    bank, I had gone for a year of night school to the New York University Graduate
                    School of Business Administration, and so Personnel thought that this meant that
                    I was interested in administration. This was the time of Walter Wriston and the
                    Wriston Program, so I became a personnel technician.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came in in 1955. Did you have any training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: No. I didn't take the A-100 until almost two years later. They threw me
                    right into the trenches in the Office of Personnel, which was disorganized
                    work—it was a question of pushing papers, getting orders processed, and taking
                    care of people with different kinds of problems. I carved out a little niche as
                    being responsible for personnel assignments for secretaries in most of the Far
                    East. So I was persuading secretaries to go to Seoul, Jakarta, and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was quite a problem, because in those days, as I
                        recall, secretaries were far more important than officers as far as
                        recruiting and getting them to go.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Most of these secretaries were on their first tour, and their idea was
                    always to go to Paris, and when it turned out to be someplace else, they felt
                    that they had somehow been deceived. But I was reasonably successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I did some of this. The attributes that make for a good
                        used car salesman sort of carry over into that particular type of
                        assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, I don't think I would have been a good used car salesman, but I could
                    reassure these young women, on one hand, show them pictures of the post, and
                    tell them about it (I'd never actually been there, so that I had to improvise),
                    and how important it was, and how they'd be members of an embassy family and
                    looked after. After a while, they'd swallow hard and go, and I think it usually
                    worked out pretty well for them.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Because I was working in this Far Eastern section of the Personnel Office, I came
                    to the eye of the Far Eastern Bureau. And when my time was coming to an end, I
                    was asked if I was interested in serving in the Far East. And I poked around
                    there. My first reaction was, well, Burma would be very interesting. It turns
                    out that Burma was, even in those days, a tough post. I had recently been
                    married and I didn't want to take on something extremely difficult, so I asked
                    for and got Kuala Lumpur. And since the post wasn't opening up for six months,
                    they allowed me to stay on and do Indonesian language training, part time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Indonesian being essentially a Malay language which was
                        spoken in both areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, Indonesian is a codification of all the local languages around there,
                    which are all related. Indonesian is like Latin is to Portuguese or Spanish. So
                    I got to Kuala Lumpur speaking fairly good Indonesian. They could understand me
                    perfectly well and were astonished, but I could never understand the response,
                    which was highly inflected Malay. Also, all secondary education was in English,
                    so that anybody that I was interested in talking to had an English education. So
                    that my Malay was only useful when traveling in the bush and the hinterlands,
                    and even then, I usually couldn't understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Kuala Lumpur from '57 to '59. What was the
                        political situation at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: I got there one month before independence and at the very end of what they
                    called the Emergency, which was a Chinese insurgency against the British and the
                    colonial system, and against the world. Lucien Pye and a number of people have
                    done a good deal of research on the real root of this Chinese Communist
                    rebellion in the jungle, which had actually broken out in the late '40s,
                    developed into a major Vietnam-like civil war in the early '50s, was eventually
                    suppressed but not eliminated in the mid-'50s, and lasted until the '70s, in a
                    flickering, reduced way. It was, to make a long and complicated story short, a
                    drama of alienation in the Chinese community, of son from father, brought on by
                    the rapid and intense social change that movement from mainland China to Malaya
                    had brought about. It was a revolt against Confucianism.</p>
                <p>The Emergency was technically still in effect when I got to Kuala Lumpur, so it
                    was a hardship post. But there was very little hardship, believe me. It was
                    still British and colonial, and had clubs and restaurants and golf courses. A
                    hierarchical society. I was amazed by it; I didn't think that such things still
                    existed. But they certainly did. But at the same time, it was a well-run
                    country, no corruption, relatively prosperous. Kuala Lumpur was and is a Chinese
                    city. I was amazed at the racial content of life there; everything depended on
                    ethnic grouping.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I was back four years ago, found everything had changed and nothing had changed.
                    The city was built up, beautiful and modern, with skyscrapers and heavy traffic
                    and all that, but the same racial tensions still prevailed: the Malays fear the
                    Chinese; the Chinese hold the Malays in contempt for their passiveness and
                    laziness; and both sides look down on the Indians, who...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in the '50s, before we had what we probably today
                        would call sensitivity training. How did the embassy deal with the—by the
                        time you were there—mostly ex-colonialist British, the Malays, the Chinese,
                        and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, we had an ambassador who had come from being deputy chief of mission
                    in Rome, and he was an old-timer, very formal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Homer Byington, Jr.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: You know him?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, yes, his ghost lingers on in Naples. He was born
                        there and served there for eons.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, he was an enthusiastic golfer. Actually, he was a likeable man, but
                    really stuck in the past. His wife was a grande dame; she insisted that all the
                    ladies wear gloves and stockings and hats, and pay calls. There was much
                    printing of formal calling cards. Sort of a European invasion of the post. It
                    was probably the most European post I've ever served at, in some respects.</p>
                <p>The British were phasing out. The Malay politicians who were running the country
                    were unsure of themselves. The Chinese were desperately worried about political
                    repression. And the country was very uneasy. The planters at the Selangor Club
                    on Saturday night, when they'd all go and drink a lot, were saying, when
                    independence comes, there would be fighting from Johor Baharu, which is down on
                    the tip of the peninsula, clear up to Alor Star. As it turned out, there was no
                    such conflict. It took place 15 years later.</p>
                <p>I rotated, did a little consular work, a little political work, and then ended up
                    doing rubber and tin, which was the main substantive economic activity there,
                    and rather enjoyed it.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>My wife had a baby, the first American born in independent Malaya. And we were
                    transferred from there to Paris. In Kuala Lumpur, I had virtually no culture
                    shock at all—everybody spoke English, you were immediately inserted into the
                    clubs, you had a charge account at the department store, and the amah (the maid)
                    came along with the apartment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that was always considered one of the nicest posts in
                        the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: It was very nice then; probably even nicer than it is now.</p>
                <p>But Paris, where I arrived on a cold November day in 1959, was very different,
                    and nobody looked after you there. If you didn't speak the language in Paris
                    1959, you were high and dry. It was much less of an international place than it
                    is now, and the French did not speak English, nor would they.</p>
                <p>De Gaulle had come in in '58. This was at the winding down of the great post-war
                    period. The Marshall Plan was phasing out. The Marshall Plan ended just shortly
                    after I got there, and we set up the OECD instead. The French were in the
                    European Community, and France was moving toward a more independent,
                    self-confident stance.</p>
                <p>But the deep divisions in French society were very apparent, even then. And the
                    relations between France and the United States were very ambivalent. The French
                    were intensely suspicious of our role in Algeria. They were intensely ambivalent
                    about what we did in Indochina. De Gaulle disliked the Atlantic Alliance, which
                    he thought was a tool of American predominance. The French had dreams of 20
                    years before, when France was considered the most powerful nation in the world.
                    That was nearly gone. It was an illusion, but the French still had it.</p>
                <p>And French society was still riven by the very factors that are being purged only
                    today; that is, who did what during the occupation? Nobody was telling the
                    truth. It was a society very much like recent society in the Soviet Union, based
                    on lies. The Communists said that they had started the resistance and won the
                    war. De Gaulle said, no, no the Free French had won the war. And in point of
                    fact, neither did. The Allied forces, primarily American, won the war. But
                    nobody was going to admit this.</p>
                <p>On the right, Americans were unpopular because of our open-democracy populism,
                    open culture, and prosperity. And sooner or later, whenever you were talking to
                    a prominent French person, someone would start mentioning the almighty dollar.
                    The almighty dollar...</p>

                <p>While on the left, which included not just the Communists and the trade unions,
                    but the entire academic community and almost all the intellectuals, Americans
                    were seen as representatives of a rotten capitalist society. First, you get the
                    Nazis, and then you get the capitalists, and we represented the capitalists.</p>
                <p>So, while Americans were personally well treated and well regarded, as a country
                    the United States was very unpopular. In the Foreign Ministry, the nationalists
                    disliked us because France had become too reliant on the United States. The
                    Atlanticists were purged by de Gaulle, which meant the friends of United States
                    were taken out of the Foreign Ministry and even out of the government.</p>
                <p>While for me, as a junior officer, it didn't make a lot of difference, this was
                    not an easy period. I had a terrible time finding a place to live and learning
                    the language. Eventually, I got 12 weeks of intensive French. I'd had a year in
                    college, and that's the only formal French I've ever had. But that gave me
                    enough so I was able to get going.</p>
                <p>At about that time, de Gaulle, in one of his typically monarchical gestures,
                    decided to free French Africa in 1960. And all of a sudden, these countries were
                    cast loose. Not exactly cast loose, but made formally independent. The embassy
                    had to find somebody to mark on that, and I found myself immersed in the
                    problems of these newly emergent countries, with their commercial and financial
                    ties with France.</p>

                <p>ELY: I spent my entire three years working in the treasury office for Donald J.
                    McGrew, himself a subject of considerable oral history. McGrew had been the
                    deputy to Tommy Tomlinson, who had been a very important figure in the Marshall
                    Plan and OEEC in the great days of the late '40s and early '50s. Tomlinson died,
                    allegedly of overwork, in 1955, I believe. And when Tommy passed, McGrew
                    replaced him. McGrew had already been there for ten years and stayed on for
                    another 15.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was subordinate to the Treasury or to the embassy? What
                        was his relationship?</hi>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>ELY: Well, that requires going back a little bit. The Foreign Service Act of 1946
                    was framed to make the Foreign Service presidential, not State Department. And
                    the Foreign Service was to represent all departments of the US
                    government—Agriculture, Treasury, and any other department with overseas
                    functions. Treasury never accepted this division; it would not give up its
                    personnel system and independence to a system that it didn't control, would be
                    dominated by the State Department. Treasury never joined, and Agriculture
                    quickly broke away. Agriculture had its Corn Belt constituency that felt that it
                    really had to control their foreign agricultural service; they couldn't let the
                    State Department run that. So the Treasury attach� in Paris was from another
                    agency. By 1959, it was quite clear that the original concept of the Foreign
                    Service Act of 1946 was forgotten. The White House would have had to give the
                    concept full support. It never got it. So it became a reversion to the State
                    Department, overall, providing the top political or economic people in the
                    embassies, and other agencies putting in their own people for their
                    functions.</p>
                <p>McGrew was innovative and unusual. He was the deputy chief of the economic
                    section. And the economic minister in Paris in those days was an important
                    person. And indeed, Jack Tuthill, who's on the board of my Jean Monnet Council,
                    was a close contact of Monnet himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's also the subject of an oral history interview we've
                        done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: He left just before I arrived, and he saw a great deal of Jean Monnet and
                    all the big actors of the post-war period, like Robert Marjolin.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, I worked for McGrew, and he trained me. He had what he called McGrew
                    University. Art Hartman was, I think, two people before me. Very intensive. You
                    had to know French very well, both how to speak it and then all the technical
                    language. Required a great deal of persistence. And you had so much contact work
                    to do. You had to call on and get to know, officials and then do your work by
                    phone, if possible. In those days in particular, the French didn't like
                    telephones very much, and they wanted you to come around. And they insisted on
                    doing everything in French, even if they were bilingual. A phony atmosphere in
                    which to operate, but still exhilarating and interesting.</p>
                <p>My work on former French Africa brought me into contact with whole sections of
                    the government where we had never had contact before—the Ministry of
                    Cooperation, which was the French aid agency; the Ministry of Education, which
                    ran the education system in that area and was paranoid about the English
                    language replacing French, a paranoia that turned out to be misplaced.</p>

                <p>ELY: Seems to, doesn't it. Although it was partly mistaken; part of the French
                    deep suspicion of Americans both replacing the French with our economic and
                    financial power and making Africa part of the anti-Communist battlefield,
                    reflecting the way that the United States tended to see the world: It's us and
                    our allies versus the Soviet Union, so let's get in there before the Russians
                    do. Well, it turned out this was heavy-handed but not inaccurate. The Russians
                    were behaving worse than we did, and they quickly moved into Guinea; they moved
                    into everywhere they could.</p>

                        Education, and all—sort of dominated by what I would put sort of to the left
                        of the spectrum? Maybe the Education more the intellectuals, and the
                        Coordination more the technocrats? How did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, for one thing, France was and remains an intensely elitist society.
                    And the peak of the elite you find in the government, and the peak of the
                    governmental elite you find in the inspecteurs des finances. And I found myself
                    running into these people everywhere I went. The inspecteur des finances is a
                    supertechnocrat, protected, powerful, privileged, overworked, brilliant, and
                    usually quite condescending. Learning to deal with these people was one of the
                    most useful things I acquired.</p>

                <p>ELY: Well, it took me a while, and I was baffled at first. But, typically, you'd
                    go down to the Direction des Relations Ext�rieur et Communiques Ext�rieur, and
                    there would be a 32-year-old inspecteur des finances, in his miserable back
                    office lit by a single yellow light bulb, wearing an old blazer and a sweater,
                    and smoking a Gauloise, and the ashes are going down the front of his shirt. You
                    sit down and he looks at you and he asks you your business. And then he says,
                    “Well, I'm glad you have that, because...,” and he explains it to you, because
                    obviously the Americans have an imperfect understanding. “It's one, two, three,
                    four, and five. And this is the way these all go together.”</p>
                <p>And after a while, you say, “That's wonderful. I hadn't understood it that way.
                    But don't you think it might be one, two, three, four, five, and six? It's even
                    better that way.”</p>
                <p>Then he looks at you, and he says, “Aha, I have a worthy antagonist.” And he
                    starts dealing with you seriously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everything fits into a form, doesn't it? As an enjoyer of
                        French movies, I find that they see systems, where I don't think Americans
                        see systems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes. It was a revelation of sorts dealing with these people, because they
                    were very good and really smart. They also have an institutional set that is
                    totally different from anything that we do. And a relatively small number of
                    people, working very, very hard, do the work of a much larger number of people
                    in American administrations. We have a resolutely non-elitist view of government
                    service, where we put in political appointees clear down to the assistant
                    secretary level. The French wouldn't dream of that. They have their corps of
                    loyal, protected, and powerful civil servants, who are put through a series of
                    cream separators, weeded out, and then they start at the top and work up. A
                    totally different system, that it makes the American system seem populist,
                    bumbling and top-heavy in comparison.</p>
                <p>Over the years, looking back, I find that the systems reflect the cultures. I
                    don't think we could operate with the French system. I think they might do a
                    little better if they had something a little closer to ours, but that's an
                    observation that I can't prove.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time, did Treasury sort of have a different view
                        than “the embassy” did about where we were going? A different French
                        policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>ELY: Not at that time. This was a time when relations between State and Treasury
                    were very close. John Leddy, who had been assistant secretary for European
                    affairs, went over to be assistant secretary of the treasury. We exchanged
                    people quite a bit, and my presence in the Treasury office in Paris was part of
                    an agreement that had been made about ten years earlier. Although there had been
                    very deep divisions between Treasury and State in the early post-war period,
                    where Treasury argued that the Europeans should have gone into massive
                    devaluations and massive trade liberalization (something they were never going
                    to do), by the end of the '40s, this had been patched up and State and Treasury
                    saw eye to eye on lots of things. By the '60s, this had broken down. Treasury
                    views on the international payment system tended to be very conservative. State
                    was becoming more innovative, and the two finally fell away. Now they have
                    reverted warring kingdoms, and cooperate on the basis of mutual advantage, and
                    are basically hostile to each other. They look to different constituencies and
                    speak only when required. Relations between State and Treasury are bad, and I
                    don't see any structural reason why this should improve. Personalities make
                    things better or worse.There is no overall control of US foreign economic policy
                    anymore. Indeed, there's no longer a willingness to admit that foreign economic
                    policy is foreign policy. The Congress in particular wants to break trade policy
                    away from other aspects of foreign policy. Most-favored-nation for China, the
                    Uruguay round, the primacy of STR, the taking of the commercial function away
                    from State to Commerce. The whole foreign economic policy process is now
                    fragmented and pulls together only at the Cabinet level in the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to drag you back to the 1950s, early '60s. We had
                        two ambassadors while you were there, Amory Houghton and James Gavin. I've
                        heard, in other interviews I've done with people who were in the embassy
                        during this time, that the embassy was sort of divided into Gaullists and
                        almost anti-Gaullists. Did you find that there was an ambivalence within the
                        various officers in how they looked at de Gaulle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes. I wouldn't say there were pro-Gaullists and anti-Gaullists, but there
                    were those that deplored de Gaulle, and those that said, “Look, this is very
                    French, it's necessary, and you've got to take it into account. Don't think that
                    this guy's going to go away, and don't think that by opposing him, you can
                    overcome him. Gaullism speaks to French people in its own way, and we'd better
                    take that into account.”</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>De Gaulle was in the process of making himself very unpopular with Americans,
                    and, indeed, the anti-French feeling began about the time that I got there, and
                    was increasing by the time I left in '62. I guess it reached a peak in '64 when
                    de Gaulle pulled out of NATO. Well, it started to crest then. The French were,
                    of course, playing both sides of the street. They were playing their American
                    cards, their European cards, and their election cards, all the East-West cards,
                    and doing their customary tightrope act in the search for national prestige.
                    This was and is much resented. Mitterrand does the same thing now, where he says
                    he wants the United States in Europe, but the Americans are going to leave
                    anyhow, so he wants to make a special deal with the Germans.</p>

                        Service officer. Looking at this, it all seems like the French are sitting
                        around doing things more to annoy us or to be different. And I'm sure that's
                        not an accurate thing, but is there something, do you think, within this
                        that makes...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: You have a couple of things. The French will maintain that they see things
                    differently from us, that they have a long-term view of Communism, civilization,
                    and all, which is opposed to our historical populace's innocent, unconsciously
                    nationalistic view. So they're wiser. And then, second, the French have a very
                    deep-seated sense of frustration and inferiority, which (as inferiority feelings
                    often do) takes the opposite form; that is, superiority and anxiety, resentment.
                    This is dying off now as the French get their self-confidence back. Many people
                    would argue that de Gaulle was a necessary phase in recovering that
                    self-confidence. They didn't have it in the early '60s. This was one reason that
                    being an American was sometimes an unpleasant business among the French. You
                    have to remember, this was the time of Sartre, and Sartre was a Communist...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a philosopher.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes, and a very influential person. The entire Sorbonne, all the
                    universities, were full of Marxists, all of whom had a dislike and contempt for
                    the United States and all it stood for. Even though they might have had some
                    nice personal feelings on the side, institutionally they were anti-American. It
                    was in 1964 that Michel Debr�, then prime minister, managed to make a speech
                    celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Normandy landing without mentioning the
                    United States, which took quite a bit of acrobatics. Well, he was a firm
                    Gaullist, and the Gaullist view was that the Free French had won the war; they
                    had liberated Paris and the Americans had come in afterwards, which was total
                    distortion. We got the liberation ready and politically stepped back to let him
                    liberate the city for his own political reasons.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>I was charg� d'affaires very briefly in 1984 at the 40th anniversary of D-Day.
                    This was when Ronald Reagan came to the Normandy beaches, with Mrs. Reagan. And
                    my wife, who is an interpreter, went out to Normandy to interpret. I was sitting
                    alone in the DCM's office; our entire embassy was out at the beaches doing
                    administrative support for the president and his party. A French historian was
                    broadcasting over French television, showing scenes where the Allies had landed.
                    He started saying what a bloody business it had been, both the landings and the
                    subsequent fighting, and the very heavy casualties on both sides, and how the
                    Americans had lost 1,000 here, and the British had lost 4,000 there, and the
                    Germans had lost half a division here, and here's where they... the German
                    tanks, and here's where the Germans holed up and 600 of them fought to the last
                    man, and the ones who were about to be captured blew themselves apart. Finally,
                    this was truth, this is what actually happened, told by a French historian to
                    Frenchmen. And I came to the conclusion, that period of French history is over.
                    The French no longer feel that they have to lie to justify themselves. And that
                    now the whole [question of] who collaborated with whom during the occupation was
                    finally coming out when they brought out the first film on that, Le Chagrin et
                    la Piti�, back in the mid-'60s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Sorrow and the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: The Sorrow and the Pity; it was about collaboration. The right wing and the
                    left wing took turns bombing the movie theaters. They both disagreed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize that you were a junior officer there, but did
                        you get any feeling about how the ambassadors, both Houghton and Gavin, were
                        responding to this difficult period? Was there a difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Houghton was a patrician from a nice family, a lot of money, and he was very
                    much of a gentleman. If there were some problem or tragedy in the embassy
                    family, there would be tactful help from the ambassador, in the form of money
                    and support: a very patrician and responsible approach. He had a slight lisp and
                    he spoke French with an accent, and the French made continual fun of him, they
                    denigrated him and ridiculed him, which was quite unfair; he was a prince. And
                    as a result he had little impact on the French, and virtually none in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>Gavin was quite different. Gavin had been a division commander during the Second
                    World War, a very famous paratrooper, and he commanded the 82nd Airborne.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and he jumped at Normandy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>ELY: He jumped at Normandy, and he jumped again at Arles. And he was decorated.
                    Gavin had been on orphan, a complicated person, very intelligent, rather driven.
                    He was supposed to speak French, but didn't speak it very well. He taught French
                    at West Point. He knew the language, but he didn't speak it. Lots of Americans
                    were that way in those days.</p>
                <p>His primary policy preoccupation was whether or not, and if so, to what extent,
                    the United States would cooperate with the French in their independent
                    nuclear-weapon capability. Gavin felt strongly that, since this was going to
                    happen, and since its impact in terms of American interests was ambiguous, that
                    is, certain aspects would be good, and other aspects bad, we should cautiously
                    cooperate with the French, and in particular provide them with computer capacity
                    and either air refueling technology or maybe even the tankers, so they could fly
                    their Mirages to and from the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>This caused a very deep policy division back in Washington, which was poisoned by
                    the deep resentment people felt for Charles de Gaulle and the anti-American
                    policies that he was orchestrating. The resentment went so far as to make, in my
                    view, rational discussion of Gavin's opposition impossible. Eventually, Gavin
                    was overruled and he quit. I think he probably ended up, as many ambassadors do,
                    as a prisoner of his own concepts. He was prepared to go further in defending
                    them than they merited. That independent nuclear strike force was supposed to
                    be, and was, a threat to the Alliance by facilitating an independent French
                    role.</p>
                <p>The French eventually did exactly what they wanted, in the sense that they were
                    able to claim the benefits of the Alliance without having to belong to it, and
                    were able to play both sides of the street. And it was to our great credit that
                    we kept the Alliance together, and it was not to their credit at all that
                    Western Europe survived this damned period until the Soviet system finally
                    collapsed.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, I never had any culture shock in Kuala Lumpur, but I had plenty in
                    Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last thing about this French view. You were dealing
                        with these French-speaking African countries, the liberation there. In the

                        were making at least very large gestures and all.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this play, from your perspective, and also with
                        the French? You'd already alluded to it, but let's talk a little more about
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, we were trying to get both sides to avoid unintended confrontations.
                    For example, we put an AID mission into Cameroon, and the first thing they did
                    was set up an import program and brought in Caterpillar tractors, which they
                    figured were needed, putting the local French Caterpillar tractor dealer out of
                    business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Now this was not very intelligent. Then we sent an educational mission. I
                    grabbed those people and took them around to the Ministry of Education, where
                    the director general of the ministry sat these people down and filleted them,
                    although they didn't understand this at the time. I had to explain afterwards
                    that they were being viewed with intense suspicion by the French Ministry of
                    Education, and since the French Ministry of Education, at least for then, was
                    very much in charge of things down there, they should be very careful in their
                    relationships with them, and be very open, very cooperative, and understand that
                    they were moving onto what these people thought was their turf.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And very sensitive turf, at that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Very sensitive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything—language, culture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: All these things. La Mission Civilisatrice (the Civilizing Mission of
                    France) was and remains at the heart of every French person. Since they tend to
                    think that their civilization is better than anybody else's, it's extremely
                    important to them.</p>
                <p>So I did this sort of honest brokering, which was very cross-cultural; it really
                    got me inside the mind of these French civil servants. They're brilliant,
                    overworked, underpaid, paranoid, suspicious, and always thinking ahead in terms
                    of the interests of France, as defined by them. I found it was fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, this is nuts and boltsish, but I think this was a
                        very interesting time. You had these American educators coming out who must
                        have been up against real cultural shock. How did you prepare them, and how
                        successful was this when they were going to come up against the cultural
                        vehemence of the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: I would give them briefings and would try to say, “Well, look, fellows, I'm
                    not speaking for the French government. Because I give you their viewpoint
                    doesn't mean that I believe this. I just want you to know what you're getting
                    into.” And then say, “They've been down there for X years. The French looked on
                    Africa back in the '30s as their strategic reserve for the Second World War.
                    They'd put investments in there to grow cotton, to kind of raise rubber, rice,
                    become self-sufficient. This colonial mentality is still alive. They put a lot
                    more into Africa than the British did, in terms of education and infrastructure
                    and all. It hasn't paid very well. And now the area's becoming independent. And
                    there's a lot of sensitivity about it. Be careful of the French; don't consider
                    them your friends.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is April 17, 1992, and this is the second interview
                        with Michael E. C. Ely. We had left Paris, where you'd been from '59 to '62.
                        Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: The Department sent me to Harvard for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you studying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: I studied purely economics, although I got a degree in public
                    administration. I did the get-rich-quick, low-quality MPA degree. Harvard was
                    wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pause on that just for a second. What was your impression
                        of going into the academic world. Here you'd been in Paris, which was
                        certainly a major financial center and things were happening and all. And to
                        go to Harvard, with your view there. What was your view of sort of the
                        academic approach and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, I found the whole thing very stimulating. I'd worked very hard in
                    Paris and had a lot of stress. I found that I worked just as hard in Cambridge,
                    although I was not familiar with the way that they treat students at Harvard;
                    that is, they give you utterly unreasonable reading lists and expect you to work
                    it out. I did, in fact; I learned how to read 20 articles in an evening and
                    extract the essence of each of them, discarding the ones that were less
                    important and concentrating on the ones that were more important. I don't think
                    the professors cared one way or the other what you did, but they expected you to
                    be able to do the reading.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I took some fairly difficult courses. My mathematical preparation was modest, and
                    this was at a time when econometrics were coming on fast. They've now faded
                    somewhat, but then, everything was quantitative and mathematical. And I took a
                    couple of courses that were really quite both theoretical and mathematical. I'm
                    glad I did it. In particular, I took the Economics of Agriculture by a famous
                    Dutch econometrician named Hendrik Houthakker, who's still there. This almost
                    killed me, but I managed to pass it with a decent grade; I got an A-. And I was
                    very proud of what I did. The other courses were, by and large, less
                    demanding.</p>
                <p>I found that if I worked hard and kept my brain clear, I could do okay. I could
                    compete on equal terms with the graduate students there, whom I found, to my
                    amazement, were a beaten-down bunch. They were the lowest form of living
                    creature. A graduate student who's trying to get ready for his comprehensives so
                    he can then do his dissertation does nothing but work and worry. The versatile,
                    witty, and pleasure-loving undergraduates are quite different from the graduate
                    students.</p>
                <p>But I got a good year out of it.</p>
                <p>I was posted to Ottawa. My wife threatened to leave me if I went there, so I
                    wrote to the director general and said, look, you know, this is the first and
                    last time I'll ever do this. Can you change the assignment? After Harvard, as
                    expected, I was posted to the Department. They told me that the Harvard
                    assignment counted as part of my three-year Washington tour, which I was
                    grateful for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might add that this was in the era, which you and I both
                        belonged to, where overseas was considered better than Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: I always considered it so.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELY: Perhaps at some professional cost, which I am quite prepared to pay. Was and
                    would be now. To use a pungent phrase, one of my bosses said, “You have to
                    remember that the policy process is endless shit.” And, indeed, that describes
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's an excellent description. It's less pungent
                        overseas, where you're dealing with another country.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>ELY: Yes, that's right. Although there are very definite limits on what you can
                    do, within those limits you can have quite a bit of freedom to maneuver. It can
                    often be a temptation to your honesty to misreport the conversation. Whoever
                    lost the memorandum of conversation, you know. “I insinuated; he seemed
                    impressed.” “When I refuted his arguments, he fell back.” “We'll have to give
                    this a review.”</p>
                <p>I went from there to the Department, working again on financial matters. Did a
                    lot of fairly intensive work with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and with
                    AID, working on Africa in particular. I went on a couple of trips to Rwanda and
                    Burundi as a consultant to AID and worked on stabilization programs in various,
                    mainly African, countries, but also India as well. And worked with AID on lots
                    of questions of long-term development policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of AID in working in the
                        financial sector? Was there hope that these things would really have a
                        success, or were we just trying to shore up almost unshorable
                        countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: AID and State always had their own hidden agendas for all these
                    countries.</p>
                <p>State was, by and large, as bad as it is often depicted in the public. In other
                    words, they just wanted to get money for their client states, keep them happy,
                    keep the money coming, keep the ambassador appeased, keep the local leadership
                    appeased, going through the gauntlet of congressional requirements and hurdles
                    and hoops to jump through for the PL 480 programs and the development assistance
                    programs. So State was always just trying to get money and didn't really care
                    much about the substance on which it was spent.</p>
                <p>AID mainly was trying to cover its ass. They wanted to keep the Congress happy
                    and protect themselves against criticism, and also build some institutions and
                    have some successes that they could point to later.</p>
                <p>Some of them understood that the financial aspect was very important, because
                    without your financial system working properly—that is to say, your budget, your
                    savings and investment system—you're probably not going to go anywhere anyhow.
                    The first requirement is law and order, the second requirement is a legal
                    system, and the third requirement is a financial system. This was acknowledged,
                    but not paid much attention to.</p>
                <p>I would say that my impact on AID policy was some, at the margin, but not really
                    important.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I got myself in trouble with State because I was always criticizing their
                    favorite projects, many of which merited criticism. But it didn't bother me.
                    Actually, I had quite a good time. And out of the process, got myself assigned
                    as chief of the Economic Section in Algiers, in 1966. That's the one assignment
                    that I actively went out and sought and obtained, and is probably the worst job
                    I ever had.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a theory in the Department: Don't ask for
                        something—you might get it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, I did ask, and I got it, and it turned out to be a disaster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First, before we leave your time dealing with the
                        International Monetary Fund, what was your impression, during this '63 to
                        '66 period, of the value and, you might say, the administration of the
                        International Monetary Fund? What were some of the pressures on it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, the Fund back in those days had a much clearer mandate than it has
                    now. We were still on something like fixed rates. This meant that countries were
                    supposed to keep their parities essentially pegged, although nominally, to the
                    gold relationship to the dollar. It was also a time where we were getting more
                    deeply into Vietnam, and the dollar as a reserve currency was coming
                    increasingly under question, where LBJ was trying to fight a war in Vietnam
                    without raising taxes. Inflation was creeping up in the United States, and the
                    collapse of 1970 was being prepared, slowly. And the American administration did
                    not understand very well what was going on. The French were buying gold from us,
                    which put us under pressure. There was a lot of anxiety about the functioning of
                    the international system and the dollar as the centerpiece of it, but not much
                    in the way of consensus on what to do about it.</p>
                <p>The State Department E Bureau in those days was quite influential. It was a
                    powerful bureau and had ideas about what might be done. State recognized that
                    the international financial order was under pressure, and that this had profound
                    foreign policy implications, and was looking for some sort of creative
                    international method of getting at this problem. In the end, State was
                    unsuccessful.</p>
                <p>The problem was basically Treasury. Treasury should have been doing what State
                    was trying to do, but Treasury was trying to maintain the status quo; that is,
                    to patch up the existing system essentially by exhorting our allies not to rock
                    the boat.</p>
                <p>The French were being financially aggressive for essentially political
                    reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was their motivation, do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>ELY: Well, de Gaulle, by this time, was trying to bring down the Anglo-Saxons. He
                    had gotten himself into a psychological, moral set by which he was locked in
                    combat with us for...how should I say, not domination of Europe, that's too
                    simple, to reduce American influence, but particularly to reduce American
                    prominence in Europe. American presence was desirable only up to a certain
                    point. Beyond that, it became inimical to French interests.</p>
                <p>The Germans, on the other hand, saw what we were doing and were upset by it. They
                    saw that the kind of policies that were required to keep the dollar as the
                    center of the international financial system were not being followed.</p>
                <p>It was about this time that a long ago and now forgotten debate about the special
                    drawing rights to pay for gold took place. SDRs still exist, they're around, but
                    it's such an arcane subject that bankers don't understand it, much less the
                    public. LBJ actually decided, in principle, in the mid-'60s, that he would
                    consent to phasing out the dollar as the centerpiece of the international
                    financial system, and move, over time, to an SDR-based international financial
                    system. That's never happened and nobody talks about that anymore. The whole
                    plan was overwhelmed in 1970 when we went off the gold standard and re-fixed
                    parities, and then went to a floating rate system, which, with some
                    modification, continues today and seems to work better than any alternatives,
                    although it is sometimes criticized as being unstable.</p>
                <p>I was not really working on these global international monetary questions myself;
                    I was fussing around with Rwanda and Burundi and Liberia and North Africa and
                    India. Got mixed up in Indian affairs, and I guess there were a couple of us
                    working-level fellows who proclaimed loudly that the emperor had no clothes.
                    Most people familiar with Indian affairs recognized that the Indian rupee was
                    quite severely overvalued. And this was a very potent force in limiting India's
                    export competitiveness and in causing high protective barriers to protect Indian
                    industry and the highly regulated trade and financial system. The rupee was way
                    out of line, and India was absorbing 20 percent of the world aid in those days
                    and following inappropriate policies. And it was not surprising that not much
                    development was happening in India. We blew the whistle on that, and it caused a
                    subdued scandal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm looking at systems, and India, more or less, has had

                <p>ELY: Actually, I never got to the point where I was sending telegrams to the
                    ambassador. I did talk to the people at the Fund, particularly to Bill Dale, who
                    was the deputy managing director, and I talked to the people at AID. Ernest
                    Stern, who has since gone to the World Bank, was the AID director for South
                    Asia. Stern was a very tough, capable guy, and I think he knew all along what
                    was going on, but he didn't want his life complicated by having to take on the
                    Indians and tell them that our aid program was contingent on their revaluing the
                    rupee, which would be very much like the Japanese saying that their purchase of
                    American bonds was contingent on our balancing the budget. It might be a good
                    idea, but it's not the way things get done.</p>

                <p>For Africa, it was considerably more transparent, because you had this business
                    of the State desk officers lining up for their clients, and AID not wanting to
                    get burned with doing too bad projects.</p>
                <p>I remember when they were going to build the third sewer system for Monrovia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, yes, I ended up often sort of causing problems for both sides. I
                    remember two particular projects.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>I was sitting on something called the Development Assistance Staff Committee,
                    which was a statutory committee of the assistant secretary of state for economic
                    affairs, and some other people, who had to look at all AID projects over $5
                    million. And a sewer system for Monrovia came up. It turned out this was the
                    third one we'd financed. We'd financed a sewer system, which fell into disrepair
                    and collapsed, and so we'd built another one, and that one again fell into
                    disrepair, and now we were going to build a third one. And I said, “You know,
                    this is not aid, this is maintenance. If you're going to do this, you've got to
                    take steps to make sure that the Liberians charge money, and the money is made
                    available in such a way it's not diverted, and goes to the maintenance of the
                    sewage system. Either that or the sewage system is going to be a net burden on
                    the economy, or it's going to collapse and have to be rebuilt again, and we'll
                    have no development rationale.” And the State desk officer as much as called me
                    a traitor for having blocked this project, which was the only thing they had in
                    the pipeline.</p>
                <p>Then another case in which, as I recollect, I led the charge was the project to
                    build a railroad from Iran to Turkey for CENTO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: CENTO was a pact we had in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: That's right, the Central Treaty Organization. CENTO needed some sort of
                    political symbolism, because the members were a disparate bunch, and it was
                    decided that, for strategic and symbolic reasons, we would build a railroad from
                    Tehran to central Turkey, where we would hook up to the Turkish railroad system.
                    This would go across 800 miles of desert, or barren area, and they would ferry
                    the thing for 80 miles on a lake, so they wouldn't have to build the tracks.
                    This was a couple of hundred miles from the border of the Soviet Union, so it
                    could be taken out in ten minutes. And it was going to cost several hundreds of
                    millions of dollars.</p>
                <p>We looked for economic justification, and were told, well, they hoped that this
                    railroad would, as many railroads have done in the past, generate a lot of
                    hitherto unsuspected commerce and trade in the area, and would probably work
                    out, and even if it didn't, it wouldn't be all that bad.</p>
                <p>And my feeling was, okay, you can build this thing if you want, but don't call it
                    development assistance, because it's not.</p>
                <p>And so the staff committee bounced it, and it went up to Dave Bell, the AID
                    administrator, and he laughed and said, “They're right, you know. Let's put it
                    on the back burner. If we want to build it out of our quasi-military assistance
                    funds, we can decide whether it has enough priority to do it. But, yes, they are
                    correct, we shouldn't do this as an AID project, because it's not an AID
                    project.”</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>This filled me with a certain amount of self-righteous satisfaction, although, as
                    I say, all this stuff was on the margin. We were doing a lot of silly things
                    around the world in those days, and I merely happened to latch on to some of the
                    sillier ones.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELY: We were covering Tunisia with AID projects—we and everybody else. If you go
                    to Tunisia, you'll see that the country is covered with clothes factories and
                    agricultural institutes and teacher-training institutions that grateful aid
                    donors have given to reward the Tunisians for their moderating, intermediary
                    position in Arab affairs. I noticed that all these projects were marginal. None
                    of them looked very good.</p>
                <p>Algeria, however, was different. I'd been in Paris when the Algerian war was
                    going on, and, indeed, when the generals had tried to mount a coup against de
                    Gaulle, with paratroops flying up from Algiers. The Algerian government that
                    emerged under Ben Bella was populist, radical, traumatized, and looking for
                    friends. Ben Bella was very difficult to deal with; he was authoritarian and
                    arbitrary, but he wanted to have good relations with the United States. And we
                    started to put in an AID program.</p>
                <p>During the war, we had actually picked up a number of young Algerians in Tunisia
                    and sent them to the United States to study petroleum engineering. This was the
                    smartest thing we ever did. We spent less than half-a-million dollars on that
                    program, and it has changed the country. The present prime minister is one of
                    those Texas boys, and a lot of them came back with Texan wives. They had a hard
                    time, but it did inject a sensible American presence into the elite there, which
                    was very much a French colony.</p>
                <p>About the time, however, that my assignment got firmed up, Ben Bella was thrown
                    out and the gloomy, gritty colonel, Houari Boumedienne, came in. And Boumedienne
                    was very suspicious of the Americans. Vietnam was getting bigger and bigger. The
                    Revolutionary Council looked at us and they came to the conclusion that the
                    American action was not compatible with Algerian revolution, and that after we'd
                    won in Vietnam, we'd knock off Algeria. They saw the Sixth Fleet in the
                    Mediterranean as essentially aimed at Algeria. They were really self-centered
                    paranoiacs.</p>

                <p>And the budding relationship was suddenly turned around. The AID director left, I
                    took over the AID section, and we decided we would cut back the PL 480, a little
                    bit of technical assistance. We were hardening the terms of the PL 480, and the
                    Algerians couldn't accept that. They didn't really believe that this was in
                    response to congressional pressures and reduced availabilities.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, our telephones were tapped, our servants were suborned and
                    interrogated, we were watched all the time. The East Germans were giving
                    instructions to the Algerian secret police.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The East Germans apparently had one of the most effective
                        training programs of anybody in the world. It still lasts today, of training

                <p>ELY: Tough, cold, ruthless, merciless. They were also trying to recruit our
                    secretaries and communications people. They were luring people into black-market
                    deals. It was a real mess.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, you felt distinctly unwelcome there. You were lied to in the Foreign
                    Ministry. You had to get permission to go out of the capital. You couldn't get
                    in to see people. It was not a pleasant tour.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard that the Algerians, as a group, are a pretty
                        dour group. They're not the volatile but interesting Arab, at least that's
                        my impression.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: No, the Turks subdued them in a very economical and authoritarian colonial
                    iron rule. And then the French came in and humiliated them further. The French
                    colonial experience there, quite unlike the French colonial experience of Black
                    Africa, which was fairly liberal, humane and decent, was quite incompatible with
                    the French idealism of liberty, fraternity, and equality. The Algerians, already
                    a gloomy people, learned to hate the French. Bloody civil war broke out. A
                    million Algerians died, most of them of disease. The French used torture. The
                    Algerians used terrorism. The moderate Algerians were all killed off by the
                    extreme Algerians. The French moderates themselves were attacked and
                    assassinated by the French military extremists. It was a very bad period.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the French, and de Gaulle in particular, were hanging the mantle of
                    imperialism on the shoulders of the Americans. “See, we want to help you, but
                    these Americans, ha ha, they're out to get you! Look at what's going on in
                    Vietnam.”</p>

                        would have made us a much more attractive area to deal with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, it could have. Washington was of two views about the Algerians.</p>
                <p>One was that, okay, these people are tough, they've had a hard time, we've got to
                    be tolerant and work with them, “petite crisp de jeunesse,” traumatized, we've
                    got to get to know each other. We could put in an AID program there and keep it
                    going and help feed the children and the hungry people—food for work, and
                    reforestation.</p>
                <p>The other deal was that, you know, these people are tough, violent, Marxists,
                    anti-American, anti-capitalist. They have their party ideologues who are
                    professionally anti-American. And, you know, we're basically wasting our time
                    there. We're never going to get anywhere. We shouldn't be trying; it's
                    humiliating and counterproductive.</p>
                <p>And the Embassy got caught between these two schools. And so you could never get
                    clear instructions from Washington, because there was no clear policy.</p>
                <p>I negotiated, at great difficulty, with my one Algerian friend, who ran the
                    Economic Section in the Foreign Ministry... He's now the secretary general of
                    IFAD (International Fund for Agricultural Development) in Rome, a multibillion
                    dollar assistance agency. We finally negotiated a $28 million PL 480
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: PL 480 is wheat, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Mainly wheat and a few other things, some oil. And just as we were about to
                    sign it, an American, married to a Frenchwoman (he had been a G.I. in North
                    Africa and married a local girl and settled down), staggered into the embassy in
                    Paris, saying that the Algerians had confiscated his farm without compensation,
                    and if he didn't get it back, he was going to kill himself. Now we had, and
                    still have, a prohibition against giving aid to countries that confiscate
                    property of Americans.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELY: The Hickenlooper Amendment, exactly. So Algeria was in technical violation
                    of the Hickenlooper Amendment. And I was told to go in and tell the Algerians
                    that they had to give this guy his farm back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or compensation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, the Algerians had billions and billions of dollars' worth of French
                    claims that they had not settled and were not going to settle for quite a while,
                    and to settle with the Americans before they took on the French was something
                    they were never going to do.</p>
                <p>So the whole thing, as they say, fell into the water, and the loan was withdrawn.
                    Relations, already bad, descended to the iciest, most distant level.</p>
                <p>And then came the June war in '67.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was between Israel and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Egypt. And the Arab world broke off relations with the United States. The
                    Algerians called in our ambassador, and, in a rather friendly way, said, “Okay,
                    you know, everybody's doing it, we're going to do it, too. Can you leave in two
                    weeks? No hard feelings.” So we arranged to leave in two weeks. Ten days later,
                    after Americans were out of all the other Arab countries, they came in and said,
                    “By the way, we made a mistake. We can't control the mobs. You've got to get out
                    in 48 hours.” This was essentially for their own political purposes. They
                    orchestrated a couple of demonstrations in front of the embassy. And so we
                    brought in a plane and evacuated everybody.</p>
                <p>A few of us stayed on. I stayed on as the economic guy. Five of us as the
                    American interest section of the Swiss Embassy, where I stayed for the next six
                    months, and then was direct-transferred to Mogadishu to fill a vacancy
                    there.</p>
                <p>Now Mogadishu. The GNP of Mogadishu was considerably less than the oil production
                    of Algeria. It was a much smaller place and far behind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get there, just a couple of things. While you
                        were in Algeria, did you find that the Soviets were really imbedded, or was
                        this a marriage of convenience and it wasn't taking very well?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>ELY: The Soviets were trying very hard to become imbedded. They equipped the army
                    and set up a training program of taking people back to the Soviet Union. They
                    brought in industrial advisors and tried to get the Algerians (who were very
                    statist people and wanted to run everything themselves from the top) to follow
                    Russian quantitative methods in their economic planning.</p>
                <p>The Algerians that I knew, the intellectuals, were contemptuous of the Russians.
                    First of all, their agricultural equipment was no good, nowhere nearly as good
                    as the French or the American. The amount of planning required was ridiculous
                    and not feasible.</p>
                <p>The French were influential. The French brought down advisors. This whole statist
                    approach was more agreeable, more natural to them, than to us. We kept saying,
                    why don't you do something about the private sector? They had no intention of
                    doing anything about the private sector. And only now are they doing anything
                    about the private sector. It's taken them a full generation to decide that they
                    were going down the wrong road. And, indeed, they destroyed their agriculture.
                    You could see it at the time.</p>
                <p>But the Algerians were running in circles, and Algiers was a very depressing
                    city. Unemployed everywhere. Revolutionary rhetoric, but nothing happened. The
                    government was building steel mills that they didn't need, building heavy
                    industry it didn't need of all kinds, wanted to have an automobile plant.
                    Imprisoning foreigners for real or imagined tax evasion. They would hold them in
                    jail for a couple of weeks, then let them go. There was no real violence or
                    cruelty, on the one hand, but a continuing menace that was held over everybody.
                    When we finally evacuated and had to leave the country, the Algerians searched
                    all the luggage of the departing diplomats. They also were obsessed by the fact
                    that some Americans had firearms; some Americans had brought in their .22s and
                    shotguns and all. I had myself, and we used to go hunting for snipe. But for the
                    Algerians, this was very, very menacing, an indication that the Americans were
                    up to no good at all.</p>
                <p>So it was a really unpleasant tour and I accomplished nothing there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question. Most of the time you were there, John
                        Jernegan was the ambassador. He's sort of an old Middle East hand and all.
                        What was his method of operation, and how did you evaluate him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, Jernegan is a patient man and wise, tolerant and unexcitable. He
                    didn't speak Arabic. He used quiet diplomacy, being friendly, not taking offense
                    at things, letting the Algerians talk, and listening to them.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>He made one mistake when he was talking to Bouteflika, the fiery, young,
                    militant, very ambitious, left-wing, foreign minister. When Bouteflika told
                    Ambassador Jernegan that diplomatic relations were, indeed, being broken, and,
                    oh, at this time, instead of having two weeks, he had to leave in 48 hours,
                    Jernegan said, “Vous n'�tes pas s�rieux?!” Which he meant as, “You're not
                    serious?!” But in French it means something else; it means, “You're joking.” And
                    Bouteflika hit the ceiling. It was sort of like saying, “Oh, come on, get off
                    it.” And Ambassador Jernegan said, “Oops, that was the wrong thing to say.”</p>
                <p>I said, “You know, I don't think that he understood what you meant. That's not
                    how you say, 'You're not serious.'”</p>
                <p>He said, “Oh, that's right.”</p>
                <p>I think the Algerians liked Jernegan as much as they could like any American at
                    that particular time, when nobody would acknowledge liking anything about the
                    American government. And yet you could feel yearning among the Algerians for a
                    better society. And they could see that the United States, in some respects, was
                    a better society, even though the French told them that the United States had a
                    bad political system, capitalism was unfair, and there was a lot of racism in
                    the United States, and inequality and corruption. This came regularly through
                    French sources. The Algerians picked up on this so eagerly that you knew that
                    they were looking for something to withstand the natural attraction they had for
                    free society in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the French had developed, despite the
                        bloodletting of the Algerian war, the same sort of intellectual caste that
                        is still in France, which is so powerful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, the French left and intellectuals had always disapproved of the war,
                    and they claimed legitimacy in having understood and sympathized with the
                    Algerians. And they continually played that card. Many of the young Socialists
                    who are now in power in Paris were conscientious objectors. Either they were
                    conscientious objectors before the war, or they went to Algeria and this turned
                    them into pacifists. It was a dirty war. They saw the torture, the violence, the
                    escalating hostility and hatred, and wanted to have nothing to do with it. So
                    the French intellectuals have always had a soft spot for Algerian independence,
                    and feel, in some unacknowledged way, responsible for what the Algerians do.</p>
                <p>So when the FLN Party called off the elections six weeks ago, because the party,
                    which is sort of like the Russian Communist Party, discredited and

                <p>There's another argument, too, that the fundamentalists would then destroy the
                    democratic framework of the elections if you let them win, so you're justified,
                    in the name of democracy, in canceling the elections. I don't know how strong
                    that argument is.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes, early '68 to mid-'69. Somalia was still a nominal democracy; there was
                    a parliament and a president. The Russians were arming the army, and we and the
                    Germans were working with the police, giving them light arms, light planes, and
                    communications, and resisting calls that they be turned into an opposition
                    force.</p>
                <p>Ray Thurston was the ambassador. Thurston was an old European pro. He'd been
                    ambassador in Haiti although he missed out on something in Eastern Europe by
                    going there. Thurston, with, I would say, amused sympathy and irony, saw the
                    deterioration of the Somali political process. I left there at the end of summer
                    in '69, and the military coup d'etat took place a couple of months later. The
                    quality of the embassy wasn't very much. I didn't get on well with the DCM, who
                    was heavy and unimaginative. The Political Section was weak. I considered myself
                    a high-powered macroeconomist with a lot of financial background. This was

                        feeling, although I really didn't know the area, just the job, was that
                        here's a country that you could buy. If you really wanted it, you could buy
                        it, the only fly in the ointment being the fact that the Ethiopians would
                        get mad at us if we did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes, I often used to come up with the idea that we ought to get a consortium
                    of eight bidders together and buy the country, instead of renting it, and then
                    go on the gold standard and do away with central banks and all this sort of
                    thing. Just set up a legal system and let people come and go as they wanted, and
                    not fool around with institution-building and all this other stuff. The Somalis
                    are very intelligent people.</p>

                <p>ELY: Well, they're intelligent, they're handsome, they're also very difficult to
                    deal with, very self-reliant, speak all languages, adapt to anything. But the
                    country had almost no institutions, and the police, the army, and the central
                    bank were the only institutions that functioned. And it was always very hard to
                    get American diplomats to go there; Foreign Service Officers resisted. When I
                    got there, it really was the end of the world. There was one flight a week in
                    from Italy, and that was it. They had broken off relations with Kenya, so there
                    were no flights there. And you didn't get any visitors. But it wasn't all that
                    bad. You were left alone. If your health was okay, you could enjoy it there. I
                    shot a lot of birds and enjoyed that. Did a lot of swimming. Served out my time.
                    Didn't have a lot to do.</p>

                        you've been dealing in the rather complex world of economics and all this,

                        it's probably better saying into the sands and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, I felt I'd been kind of shanghaied. I had; they owed the ambassador
                    something, so they offered me up to please him. I served out my time there and
                    did the best I could. As I say, I didn't get along very well with the DCM, who
                    was heavy and unsympathetic, and I didn't think much of the work. But, you know,
                    you've got to soldier on. You're sent there, so you do your best. You don't
                    decide that the work is beneath you. You do what you can. So I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that everything we were doing in Somalia (I'm
                        talking about the embassy as a whole, but obviously it's a small one, so you
                        were picking up what was happening) was predicated on not upsetting the
                        Ethiopians, which again was predicated on keeping Cagnew Station and Asmara
                        open?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, yes. Our policies in Somalia were conditioned by our closer
                    relationship with Ethiopia. And this put us in a delicate position, because
                    there has been a longstanding boundary dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia over
                    the Ogaden that goes back to the end of the last century, when the first
                    boundaries were laid out by the British. The Addis Ababa regime was fairly
                    unsavory. They would send tax-collecting expeditions, which were essentially
                    punitive expeditions where they'd go out and grab all the livestock they could,
                    and maybe some of the women. Resistance would lead to villages being burned and
                    people being shot, which led to the Somalis arming guerrillas and low-level
                    conflict continually on the border, going up and down. There was no end to that
                    one, and there still is no end. Somalia, of course, has collapsed into civil war
                    and chaos. The two cities of Hargeysa and Mogadishu have been destroyed. The
                    central government has been wiped out, and it is now being disputed over by
                    rival clans, armed to the teeth, who fight private wars against each other.</p>

                        Somalia in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>ELY: In those days, the Soviets were backing the Somalis against the Ethiopians,
                    and we were backing the Ethiopians against the Somalis. But we had a sea anchor
                    in Mogadishu to keep the Somalis calmed down, and the Russians had a mission in
                    Addis Ababa to follow what was going on there and keep in touch with the
                    Ethiopians. After the military coup, then there was a good deal of switching of
                    sides back and forth.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The damnedest thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: And the end result has been disastrous for both Ethiopia and Somalia.
                    Although outside powers should not be expected to be altruistic and
                    philosophical in their approach to these backward countries, we can take no
                    pride in what we did. We were driven by what the Russians did. And the Russians
                    were being very aggressive. They put in some sort of naval installation in
                    Berbera. They wanted to turn Somalia into a Marxist state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, the Soviets were doing this, and our policy was, if
                        they're doing this, we've got to back the other side. But did you ever sit
                        down and figure out what good this was going to do the Soviets, and think
                        maybe we should just let this thing go? Or were we reactive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, I often thought about, you know, did it really make any difference
                    what happened there. You have a general humanitarian reaction: Well, okay, this
                    is a very poor, backward country, they want to modernize (at least some do), and
                    we really should help them do it. We can bring them the things that they need,
                    in terms of financial institutions and skills, doctors and legal assistants et
                    cetera. And, yes, we're under some moral obligation to assist people who wish to
                    modernize.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, assisting Somalia has always been very difficult. The Peace
                    Corps had a terrible time there. They managed to stay there for a while, but it
                    was the most difficult Peace Corps assignment that they had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: The Somalis are very independent-minded people, and you can't tell them
                    anything. The Peace Corps never would go into secondary-school teaching, because
                    once a Somali has a secondary-school education, he considers that he ought to be
                    instructing you. So the Peace Corps stayed with housing and teaching English.
                    They had a fairly significant failure rate, but they also did quite a good
                    job.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Reacting to the Soviet Union...yes, we did it, and there was recognition that we
                    did have a reactive policy. And we were searching for other instruments, other
                    ways of doing business. After the emperor fell, we tried very hard to provide
                    incentives to the successor regime to continue its contacts with the United
                    States and to modernize and to build institutions. In a country that was
                    composed of a mosaic of tribal affiliations, where Eritrea had been in revolt
                    for many years, the danger appeared to be that Ethiopia would split into
                    different countries, different mini-states. Washington was and still is deeply
                    concerned about the split-up of countries in Africa because of the prospect of
                    endless strife, both border disputes and rivalries.</p>
                <p>Africa is a difficult place to live and work, and after I'd done Algeria and
                    Somalia, I was glad to be quit of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left, then, in '69. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Canadian National Defense College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is July 17, 1992, and this is a continuing interview
                        with Michael E. C. Ely. Mike, on our last tape, we were talking about your
                        time in Paris from '59 to '62 as the financial/economic officer. And there
                        were two things thing that I found where the tape had jammed. So if you
                        don't mind, we'll go over them again. One was, you mentioned an episode
                        where you were briefing US educators before they were going to French
                        Africa. Could you tell me what transpired on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes, well, this was one of the first missions to Francophone Africa after
                    independence in 1960. A group of AID educators was going off on a survey of the
                    area to see what kind of education programs they wanted to put in. I told the
                    Ministry of Cooperation about these people and asked if anybody had anything to
                    say to them. I was referred to the director general of cultural programs in the
                    Ministry of Cooperation, who turned out to be a very senior official from the
                    Ministry of Education who spoke perfect English. And I took these bureaucrats
                    over to see this fine, distinguished, highly educated and intelligent French
                    civil servant, who proceeded to fillet them alive. And he did it so skillfully,
                    they didn't even notice. It was almost a parody. He said, “Well, you know, we've
                    been in this area for a long time, we've worked very hard, we've tried to give
                    the people there a knowledge of French culture and language. This has been a
                    long-term and difficult assignment. We're proud of the job that we've done. And
                    I hope you'll keep this in mind, because really they don't need more languages,
                    they need to learn one language. And the language they need to know is French.
                    If you start competing programs, this is going to cause confusion, and it could
                    cause friction and misunderstanding. So we hope and advise prudence and caution
                    on your part.”</p>
                <p>So we walked out, and the people said, “Wasn't he nice!”</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>I said, “Well, he wasn't being nice. There was nothing nice at all about that. He
                    was saying, 'Stay out. We don't want you.'”</p>
                <p>He'd also said, “You know, this is Africa entering the Cold War. And we've
                    noticed that where you go, the Russians go, and the other way around. And the
                    last thing we need is to have this area turned into an area of rivalry.
                    Soviet-American rivalry would cause all kinds of problems for them, for you, for
                    us, for the Africans. So keep this in mind,” which, in effect, meant, Would you
                    kindly stay out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it from an American policy point of view, it
                        sounds like the man was making two very valid points at that time, which was
                        '59 to '62. One was that if the French were putting a big effort there, what
                        was our business trying to move them to the English thing? And the other one
                        was, I'm not sure but whether there wasn't some correctness in the idea that
                        the Soviets and Americans sort of followed each other around like snarling
                        cats or something, in different parts of Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, yes. The French motivation was quite complex. We started off when John
                    Gunther Dean parachuted into Bamako. He was the first person to open a mission
                    there. He got there a couple of days after independence. This was very macho
                    behavior on our part, and this was highly regarded. This was the Kennedy era,
                    and this was considered a really aggressive, straight-forward, patriotic,
                    American staking out of territory. And Mali, after Guinea, was the most leftist
                    and militant of the former French colonies.</p>
                <p>The French also were worried that our presence there would dilute their
                    influence. They would say, quietly and aside, “Well, look, we have a lot of
                    domestic political support for our programs in Africa now. It's selective. It's
                    trading companies with some political parties and its ministries. If you guys
                    muck around too much, you're going to undermine that support, and you're going
                    to make it harder for us to keep a presence there, a presence that is favorable
                    for Western interests in general, and yours in particular.” This turned out to
                    be a slightly disingenuous argument. French policy toward those areas was being
                    run out of the �lys�e Palace by de Gaulle and his people, and not by the flour
                    millers in Bordeaux and the people that were selling surplus French butter and
                    things of that nature to the Africans.</p>
                <p>Also, the French had been practicing a kind of regional policy. They had a single
                    currency for West Africa, for Equatorial Africa, and for Madagascar. This was
                    linked to the French franc through a special account in the French treasury. And
                    the operation of this mechanism prevented the kind of catastrophic inflation and
                    overvaluation of currencies that you got in Ghana and in Nigeria, and kept the
                    countries of Francophone Africa in some sort of a loose economic
                    confederation—they could always trade with each other, and it promoted economic
                    stability and perhaps some political stability in the area as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>The French were worried about this system, as well they should have, because if
                    you looked at it very closely, you could make an argument that it tied the
                    Africans very closely to France with a mechanism that virtually ensured that
                    their currencies were overvalued. And when they had an overvalued currency, it
                    made it very difficult for them to diversify their outside contacts.</p>
                <p>But the judgement was made in Washington that the advantages outweighed the
                    disadvantages. And I think this was correct. In point of fact, Africa's gone its
                    own way, and neither the French nor us have been able to do a great deal
                    affecting its destiny. The Africans are going to have to do that. They have
                    understood that point now, and they're trying themselves to decide what they
                    want to do. The continent is in very bad condition, partly bad luck, partly
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was another account that you gave that we missed the
                        last time because of a tape problem. Could you tell me your impression at
                        this time of how you dealt with and the importance of the French
                        intellectuals. One always hears of the French intellectuals, which in no
                        other country seem to play a role. But there always seems to be this group
                        that is pronouncing judgment, usually derogatory, on the United States. How
                        did you work with and assess the importance of the French intellectual at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, intellectuals in France have a much different role than they have in
                    the United States, for a whole series of reasons. I once read an account of
                    someone who overheard some disgruntled workers saying, “Let's go get Jean-Paul
                    Sartre and organize a demonstration and march on city hall.” The workers and the
                    intellectuals tended to recognize each other. Intellectuals are admired in
                    France. They tend to be literary people, skillful in language.</p>
                <p>In those days, and even now in some respects, to a man, they're of the left. In
                    recent years, for various reasons support for Marxism among the French left has
                    diminished, but there's still a residual anti-American flavor that you can find
                    very clearly in Le Monde Diplomatique. If you read that every month, you'll see
                    there's not an article in there that is anything but critical and hostile to the
                    United States. It is written by certified, old-fashioned intellectuals.</p>
                <p>The intellectuals have two or three quarrels with the United States.</p>
                <p>One is that it's the land of capitalism. First, you defeat fascism, as happened
                    in the Second World War, then you go on and defeat capitalism, as embodied in
                    the Great Satan United States, with its manipulated voting populations, its
                    powerful corporations that dominate the political process, its manipulated
                    media, its exploitative advertising, its crass, materialist values.</p>
                <p>In addition to being a crassly materialist capitalist country, the United States
                    is disorderly. It has no common culture. In fact, it has no culture at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>It is excessively pluralistic, too rough and tumble, nobody is in charge. It's a
                    government not of people or principles, but of laws, and the laws are a facade,
                    and the hollow protections of the US Constitution are a mockery. Basically,
                    Americans lynch blacks, they have race prejudice, they have a repressive
                    society, unfair and unjust.</p>
                <p>This was, in the '60s, a virtually unanimous verdict of the French left and the
                    intellectuals, shared, incidentally, by the far right. The far right also found
                    American society populist, untidy, materialistic, dangerously and unpleasantly
                    popular and democratic.</p>
                <p>So the far left and the far right, really almost a hundred percent, felt that the
                    United States was a very bad country, full of bad people, and a source of most
                    of the world's ills. As an American, I found this very hard to swallow.</p>
                <p>The left talked about exploitation, prejudice, and repression, and the right
                    talked about worshiping the almighty dollar. And both liked to depict Americans
                    as ignorant, materialistic, greedy, selfish, bombastic, obsessed with violence,
                    and quite prepared to carry the Cold War to a pitch that would be dangerous for
                    the entire world. In other words, the Americans would have blown us all up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they see the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: The French saw the Soviets as the people who had won the Second World War.
                    We were late in, and we and the British had conspired to turn the force of
                    Hitler's armies on the Russians. After the Russians had blooded the German war
                    machine, the Americans landed late in the war and claimed the victory. The
                    Communist left and the Gaullist left also said that it wasn't the Americans that
                    liberated France, it was the Free French and the unions and the Communists. The
                    Americans came along later while this was all happening and consolidated the
                    victory. Michel Debr�, in 1964, managed to make a speech celebrating the 20th
                    anniversary of D-Day without mentioning the United States. Astounding!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These people were important, weren't they, even in the
                        Gaullist government, as always there? How did you, on your part, and others
                        in the embassy deal with these people? Sounds like they were people who
                        weren't going to be tamed by words or deeds or anything else.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>ELY: It was difficult. The universities were a hundred percent Marxist in those
                    days, and USIA had to deal with those folks. In the government ministries, by
                    and large, the people that I dealt with were sympathetic; they were friendly
                    enough. Some of them were quite nationalistic and didn't like the United States,
                    but they always treated me reasonably well. There was some tendency to
                    condescension, but that's because these people were inspecteurs des finances,
                    the elite of the elite of the elite, powerful and protected. And here I was, a
                    foreigner not speaking perfect French, trying to deal with them on subjects in
                    which they were masters. So there was some tendency to condescend, but by and
                    large, I was well treated.</p>
                <p>De Gaulle did purge all American elements out of the Foreign Ministry. People who
                    were known to be pro-American were either sent off to obscure consulates,
                    summarily retired, or given undesirable assignments of some sort so they would
                    retire, and only people of known nationalist or Gaullist persuasion could be
                    advanced to high ranks. So the ambassador and senior people in the embassy were
                    always dealing with unpleasant people. Couve de Murville, while not a civil
                    servant, was a foreign minister. Couve was an extremely unpleasant man, cold,
                    icy, formal and uncooperative. And his deputies and senior people tended to take
                    their cue from him. So, at the highest level, you seldom got a friendly
                    hearing.</p>
                <p>On the other side, however, the French would frequently take you aside and say,
                    “Look, you know, this is temporary. We're your friends. We understand. These
                    things will pass. Our countries have so much in common. Never forget that, deep
                    down, we are with you. When the time comes and we have to be counted, we'll be
                    on your side.”</p>
                <p>And even de Gaulle would say that sometimes, too. I guess he was sincere, at
                    least he was when he was rational. Toward the end, he became almost irrationally
                    anti-American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Paris in 1962 and took an economic training
                        course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes, I spent a year at Harvard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that? Here you'd been, in the high world
                        of finance, in Paris, dealing with the matter, and then to come back to the
                        academic world, did it reflect reality?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>ELY: I loved Harvard. I lived a foot off the ground there. I had a very ambitious
                    course of study, worked hard, had very good professors and a very stimulating
                    time. And I felt that I was acquiring sources and tools that I really should
                    have had before I went to Paris. I was able to function satisfactorily without
                    them, but I would have functioned even better with them. And I thought I was
                    picking up what I needed to become professionally effective. It's turned out to
                    be true. I learned a lot in that one year. It was fairly difficult to pick up
                    and go up there for one year, find a place to live, put your kids in school, and
                    commute from Marblehead. But I did it, and by and large, I loved the whole
                    thing. We had a very good year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you came back to the Department of State, where you
                        worked in the Economic Bureau from '63 to '66. What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: I was doing international finance, basically working with the International
                    Monetary Fund on problems of developing countries. I also worked with AID on
                    some of the stabilization programs for countries in Africa. I went to Belgium
                    three times and to Central Africa twice for AID on financial missions concerning
                    Rwanda and Burundi. I also worked with the IMF on stabilization programs for a
                    number of other countries, and did some of the early work on debt policy—what to
                    do with countries who got themselves excessively indebted and could not service
                    their governmental or private borrowing. This was a new phenomenon, at least for
                    Africa, and we didn't really know how to handle it. Since then, there's been a
                    great deal of practice and theory built up, which is continuing to evolve. For
                    example, what to do about the Soviet debt. These were the early days, and it was
                    quite an interesting series of problems. I enjoyed the international financial
                    work.</p>
                <p>In those days, State and Treasury worked much more closely than they do now.
                    State Department officers were seconded to Treasury, and Treasury
                    representatives, in our six or seven big embassies, were closely integrated into
                    the operation of the Economic Section. In Paris, for example, the Treasury rep.
                    was the number-two man in the section, and when the economic minister wasn't
                    there, he was in charge, and so he was in charge of State Department people.
                    That is no longer the case, there or anywhere else. Now, the Treasury people
                    tend to run their own shop and report back to Treasury and not pay much
                    attention to the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find AID on the financial side? How well were
                        they staffed in Washington and able to deal with the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>ELY: Well, AID has always had problems handling financial questions. For example,
                    India, where we were putting in a lot of aid, had an overvalued currency that
                    was stifling its exports, which also made it necessary to have all kinds of
                    import controls for balance-of-payments programs. Well, golly, you know, giving
                    aid to a country with an overvalued exchange rate is a very expensive business.
                    And we did it, we gave hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. And I
                    complained about it to AID and didn't get anywhere. They kind of understood my
                    argument, but they didn't dare (and I think probably rightly) go to the Indians
                    and say, “By the way, we've decided we have another condition for our aid
                    program. We want you to take the rupee down 20 percent.” The Indians would not
                    have taken that advice, but somebody had to say it.</p>
                <p>I served on the Development Loan Advisory Committee, the Staff Committee, which
                    looked at all AID loans over $5 million. And, as a busy little technocrat, I
                    shot several down, saying that these loans weren't any good. This got me in
                    trouble with some of the regional bureaus where the loans were supposed to be
                    going.</p>
                <p>They wanted to build a railroad from Ankara to Tehran, to give substance to the
                    Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. This railroad was going to go through
                    hundreds and hundreds of miles of arid desert...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really, I can't think of a more nothing area there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: It was being built for political reasons. I looked at this and I said,
                    “Well, fellows, you can do anything you want, but don't do this out of
                    development assistance money, because it's not a development project. It's a
                    political showcase.” People were very upset. They were asking, “Who do you think
                    you are?” Here I was, a middle-grade officer from the Economic Bureau. NEA was
                    very upset, and so was AID.</p>
                <p>Similarly, in Monrovia we were going to finance a third sewer system. We'd been
                    putting in sewer systems every ten or 15 years. We'd put in a sewer system, and
                    it would break down in ten years and have to be replaced. There was never any
                    maintenance, and it would deteriorate, and we'd finance another one. I said,
                    “You know, I just don't think we better do this sort of thing. You can put one
                    in, but if you do, you're going to have to do it in such a way that provision is
                    made in the loan agreement that the system be maintained, so we can stop
                    throwing sewer systems at them every decade or so.”</p>
                <p>This got the African Bureau quite upset. They said, “That's the only project
                    we've got in the pipeline.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Fellows, I'm sorry.”</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me. Here you were, in the Economic Bureau,
                        doing this. Who was in charge of the Economic Bureau, and how well were you
                        backed up there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: I think I was viewed with amused tolerance in the Bureau, because they knew
                    that in the end these things had a large political content and they could not be
                    judged strictly on their technical merits. On the other hand, they liked
                    sticking a spoke in people's wheels from time to time, particularly when it was
                    well done. I think I usually was, from a substantive standpoint, correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the Ankara-Tehran railway?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, that one went up to Dave Bell, the administrator of AID, and he
                    laughed and said, “Okay, he's right. If you're going to do it, do it out of the
                    security money.” They set aside a little money for the project, but it never got
                    started. About that time, SEATO started coming unraveled. It probably came
                    unraveled because they didn't build the railway; it might have been the link
                    that held them all together...</p>
                <p>So, anyhow, these were famous young days for me. I enjoyed the whole thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you got your, what, comeuppance by being sent
                        to Algeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: No, I'd asked for that. That was one of the few assignments I ever really
                    set out to get.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went there in '66 and served until '67.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Right. They became independent in '62, and Ben Bella was the first
                    president. Ben Bella was an autocrat, but he, in some respects, wanted to be
                    friends with the United States, so we had an AID mission there. We were doing
                    some reforestation and some food-for-work, had some PL 480 money going in. We
                    had some agricultural projects. And it looked as if we were going to get into a
                    long-term aid relationship with the Algerians, which would have been very
                    healthy for them.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>But we had some problems. The Vietnam War was really heating up by that time. A
                    second was Boumedienne and the revolutionary coup against Ben Bella and his
                    people. Boumedienne was a tough Berber colonel from the hills. He was a fighter
                    and an ideologue. And he and the Revolutionary Council quickly came to the
                    conclusion that Vietnam was number one and Algeria was number two; as soon as we
                    polished off the forces of revolution in Vietnam, do the same thing in Algeria.
                    And at about the time I got there, relations between the United States and
                    Algeria began to deteriorate.</p>
                <p>That was the most unhappy assignment I've ever had. Our telephone lines were
                    tapped, our household staffs were suborned, we were under travel restrictions,
                    we were under import restrictions. The East German secret police were following
                    us around. In the ministries, we were made to wait long periods and then
                    systematically lied to. American oil companies there were harassed and
                    eventually nationalized.</p>
                <p>I negotiated a PL 480 agreement. A very painful negotiation. The chief of
                    economic affairs in the Foreign Ministry was a friend of mine; we'd been at
                    Harvard together. So we, by winks and nods, managed to get this through our
                    suspicious superiors, each of which thought the other side was trying to screw
                    it. We managed to put the thing together, and just as we were signing it, an
                    American married to a French woman from Oran went into the embassy in Paris and
                    said, unless he was given back his confiscated properties, he was going to kill
                    himself. So the whole thing got hung up on whatever the amendment was.</p>

                <p>ELY: The Hickenlooper Amendment, because this was, technically speaking, American
                    property. So when that loan was canceled, that was sort of the end of the
                    American aid program. We continued to support some voluntary agencies.</p>
                <p>Then came the June war. I was in France on R&amp;R.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELY: The Algerians called us in and said, “Well, you know, everybody's breaking
                    relations, so we're breaking relations, too. No hurry, but we'd like it if you
                    were out in a couple of weeks.”</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>We said, “All right, we understand.”</p>
                <p>Then, about a week later, Bouteflika called in the ambassador. I went along with
                    him. And he said, “You know, we can't hold down popular opinion. You've got to
                    get everybody out in 48 hours,” which was trumped up. They were just looking bad
                    to their Arab brothers because they weren't being as intransigent as the Iraqis.
                    So we chartered an airplane and flew everybody out.</p>
                <p>I stayed on with the American interest section in the Swiss Embassy, but we were
                    unable to have any contacts with the Algerians. We didn't do anything. I
                    disposed of a couple million dollars' worth of AID equipment; actually gave it
                    to the voluntary agencies. And did some impressionistic reporting. Worked with
                    the chief of station on booking of aircraft and ship dispositions.</p>
                <p>And was then direct-transferred to Mogadishu, where they'd been trying to get
                    somebody to run the Economic Section for Ambassador Ray Thurston, who was very
                    annoyed about who the Personnel people had been providing him. So I was sent
                    there, and, to my surprise, I found that the GNP of Somalia was less than the
                    monthly oil production of Algeria. It was a very small place. There was an AID
                    program there. I'd run the AID program in Algeria. The one in Somalia was
                    smaller, but they had a 30-man staff to run it. I liked the ambassador, didn't
                    like the DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Hal Joseph. And Joseph was a very solemn, heavy fellow. Thurston was bright
                    and intelligent. There was a scandal that took place when he ended up leaving
                    his wife and marrying an Italian woman who was a language teacher. This
                    eventually, I think, caused him to be recalled and caused his former wife to
                    make a lot of very loud complaints about him, publicly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Thurston's wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes. And the Italian divorced his wife and got custody of his child. So it
                    was a messy arrangement. Then the Italian judge who's wife was involved with
                    Thurston, engaged a German woman as a nurse for the eight-year-old daughter, and
                    took her out on a tiger shoot south of Mogadishu, was cleaning his rifle, and
                    shot the nurse dead.</p>

                <p>ELY: Yes, the survival rate for marriages was fairly low. The wife of the head of
                    the Political Section ran off with one of the AID guys, and was never seen
                    again. They dug up the garden, couldn't find any remains, couldn't find
                    anything. She'd disappeared.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELY: It was interesting, very much of a Cold War situation. We, with the
                    assistance of the British and the Germans, were backing the police and its
                    commander, Muhammad Abshire. Abshire had been sent to Princeton for a year on an
                    Eisenhower fellowship. A remarkable guy: incorruptible, intelligent,
                    Westernized, very concerned with his police force—hospitals and housing and
                    pensions. We provided light aircraft, radios. No weapons. We were afraid of
                    getting caught up in an arms race between the police and the army.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the Russians came in very heavy-handedly and immediately backed the
                    army; brought in armor, brought in armored personnel carriers, artillery,
                    MiG-21s.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>There was Somalia, armed to the teeth, and the country couldn't afford it. The
                    European Community built a hospital which never worked. The Russians built what
                    they called a milk factory, which was essentially a diary and made excellent ice
                    cream. The Russian projects didn't work, and our projects didn't work either.
                    Nothing worked in Somalia.</p>
                <p>The nominally democratic system was deteriorating into tribalism and corruption.
                    By the time I left it looked pretty bad. I disagreed with the Political Section,
                    which didn't really seem to think that things were changing all that much. My
                    view was that they were changing rapidly and for the worse. And Soviet influence
                    was rising. When they threw Abshire, the chief of police, into jail on trumped
                    up charges, I figured the end was near. I left in August to go to the Canadian
                    National Defense College, and in October, the military coup took place. The
                    Russian-backed regime of Muhammad Siad took over and immediately went to war
                    with Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, did you feel that, in Somalia, it was sort
                        of the feeling of the embassy that Cagnew Station in Eritrea, in Ethiopia,
                        the fact that we wanted to keep that, everything was predicated on that as
                        far as our policy was concerned in the rivalry between Ethiopia and
                        Somalia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: I never had much sympathy for Ethiopia. Their idea of governing Ogaden was,
                    every couple of years, to send out troops to collect taxes, which essentially
                    meant sending a military column to rape the women and steal the cattle.</p>
                <p>But, on the other hand, the Somalis didn't get along with anybody. They had
                    quarrels with the Kenyans, with the Ethiopians, with Djibouti, they even had
                    some quarrels with Aden. The only neighbor they got along with was the Indian
                    Ocean.</p>
                <p>It was hard to see just where truth and justice lay.</p>
                <p>And, indeed, we were energetic purveyors of the status quo, which was, I think,
                    probably the only thing we could do. Policy for the Horn of Africa was very
                    complex. It was trying to do different things, complicated by Cold War
                    rivalries, Somali-Ethiopian rivalries and inner factions within both
                    countries.</p>
                <p>So it ended up that the very substantial investment of time and treasure and
                    energy that we made in Ethiopia was largely lost. And Somalia has been destroyed
                    as a country; it no longer exists. There are several factions that hold parts of
                    the country. And it will probably never return to what it was. Thousands and
                    thousands of Somalis died, for no good purpose that I can think of. The future
                    of the country is bleak.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>I never thought it would end up badly, incidentally. I respected Somalis, and I
                    liked them, in a way. Very intelligent, independent-minded people. And I always
                    thought they had way too much good sense, as nomads, to get themselves involved
                    in bloody and continuing internecine warfare.</p>

                    pronounced the marriage healed. He was wrong. And I had a marvelous year there.
                    I was under a lot of strain. I had intestinal parasites. I had psychosomatic
                    symptoms connected with marriage problems. And I got my head screwed back on in
                    Canada.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One always hears about the Canadian attitude: Poor little

                        things, which sometimes seem to be played to a fare-thee-well, but the
                        Canadians always seem to get a little extra out of it. Did you find this at
                        the Defense College, or was this a different game?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: The people at the Defense College were Canadian military. There were three
                    American serving officers, and myself from the State Department; there were
                    three British serving officers, one guy from the Foreign Office; and the
                    remainder were Canadian civilians and military. And by and large, they were very
                    pro-American, very well disposed. They liked to say things like, “Yankee go
                    home, and take your Canadian friends with you.” They'd all served in Europe, in
                    the Canadian NATO air units there. And they'd all visited Washington. They have
                    Americans and British there not because they want to educate us, but because
                    they want our viewpoints for the Canadians. So I energetically defended American
                    viewpoints, which is what I was supposed to do. Made a lot of new friends, and
                    generally had a very good year. Compared to Harvard, it was not all that
                    intellectually stimulating, but the lectures were interesting and I learned a
                    lot about Canada. The idea was that I was going to go on as economic counselor
                    to Ottawa afterward. But the job opened up early and had to be filled, so I was
                    going to be sent to Washington to work on Canadian affairs. And my wife said she
                    would divorce me if we went to Washington, so I wrote to the director general
                    and said for once, send me somewhere else. They sent me back to Paris.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>There, my marriage continued to deteriorate.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELY: That's right. And at that time, my old boss, the Treasury attach�, was the
                    number-two man in the Economic Section. But that was changed by Dick Watson, the
                    ambassador, and, to my embarrassment, I was made the number two, over my old
                    boss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Must have been uncomfortable. Did this represent anything
                        from the Washington side as far as Treasury being unhappy with this? Or the
                        Nixon administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: No, this was an arrangement that had always existed in the embassy from the
                    early days of the Marshall Plan. The Treasury people—Tomlinson and his deputy,
                    McGrew—who stayed on were very capable, energetic, hard-working people who were
                    very active and broad gauged. They handled trade questions as well as financial
                    questions. In the Paris embassy, you had this tradition of very close
                    integration of Treasury and State.</p>
                <p>In my first job, I worked in the Treasury Section. Actually, there were two
                    officers, sometimes, in the Treasury Section. My predecessor was Art Hartman,
                    and his predecessor was Dick Vine, so there had been a lot of good State people
                    working with Treasury there.</p>
                <p>But this relationship was beginning to deteriorate by the time I got back there
                    in '70. Dick Watson was a difficult and sick man. He didn't like the Treasury
                    attach�, didn't trust him, thought he was gay because he wasn't married, and
                    eventually just decided this is the way it's going to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Watson came from the IBM family.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes, he certainly did. He was the one that had too much to drink on a
                    transatlantic flight and got into a shouting match with a stewardess, which was
                    publicized.</p>
                <p>He also did strange things around the embassy. He's the one that ordered the
                    Marine guard to take down and destroy the Christmas tree.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELY: He said, “Chop it up in pieces.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: He was drunk and he thought it didn't look right. The admin. counselor had
                    to send him a memorandum the next day saying that he had personally approved
                    that Christmas tree. And he came back, “Okay, I owe you one.”</p>
                <p>He wasn't a bad man, but he was unstable, he had a drinking problem and he was
                    arbitrary. At IBM, he played tricks on the senior management. He would organize
                    groups of junior officers to do oversight of section chiefs. The section chiefs
                    didn't like that very much. And he also ran people through a
                    goals-and-objectives exercise that you could never quite get done, it was never
                    quite right, it was always being sent back for a little more work. He kept
                    people very much on edge. He would fine people for being late to staff meetings.
                    You had to speak at staff meetings, but you had to know just how much. If you
                    spoke too much, you got cut off, and if you didn't speak enough, the conclusion
                    was that you didn't have anything to say because you weren't doing anything.</p>
                <p>There were these minor harassment measures that were continually taking place,
                    and people were rather unhappy.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, I was direct-transferred from there, marriage still deteriorating, to
                    Rome, where I ran the Economic Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served there from '72 to '75. In France, this was
                        after de Gaulle by this time, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see a difference in your dealings with the French
                        government after the departure of de Gaulle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Some attenuation. These were the Pompidou days. Pompidou was a Gaullist and
                    he was very careful not to change any of the Gaullist policies of being outside
                    of the military alliance, seeing France as an arbiter between the Soviet Union
                    and the United States, being critical of the United States' Vietnam policy,
                    generally critical of American social policies, economic policies, but with no
                    animus to it, nothing ad hominem.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>So the sting had gone down, but there was still a lot of official
                    anti-Americanism around the circuit. And it bothered people in the embassy quite
                    a bit. Indeed, the official anti-Americanism was stronger in '70 than it had
                    been in '60, when I got there, because it had been around longer, it was deeper
                    rooted, and people were getting ahead by being critical and unpleasant. In
                    '70-72, nobody would speak English—nobody—and a lot of the French spoke it
                    pretty well. Now, they'll speak English to practice if they can. Very little
                    linguistic chauvinism is left in France.</p>
                <p>It all started to change about '68, when French society was rocked to its
                    foundations by a general uprising against the structure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was June of '68.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: There were the students, workers, everybody. And the housewives... on their
                    balconies, beating tin cans with spoons.</p>
                <p>It led to a widespread reform of the very coercive educational system, which has
                    never been as good since. It led to administrative reforms. I guess the school
                    system is the main thing. It used to be that only about 20 percent of the people
                    in the 18-year-old cohort got a baccalaureate. Now, they're up to 55 or 60
                    percent, and the standards have come down quite a bit. But the intense elitism
                    and exclusivity of the French system began to be reformed at that point.</p>
                <p>Similarly, there was civil service reform. The liberalization of the university
                    system was offset by the strengthening of the “Grandes Ecoles.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The selective schools, the equivalent to bureaucratic war
                        colleges, in a way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, no, what they call the Commerce, Arts M�tier, �cole Normale, ..., and
                    several others. Because the universities are no longer selective and they can't
                    fail anybody, the value of a university diploma has plummeted, while the value
                    of a dipl�me from a Grande Ecole went up. And that has caused further problems
                    for French society, which it is now trying to sort out. It is the meritocracy
                    that runs the country, even more now than ever before. It not only runs the
                    administration, but it also tends to run a lot of the businesses, private as
                    well as nationalized.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>Anyhow, I had a nice, interesting two years. I was heading the General Economic
                    Section. We handled trade, transportation and technology questions, and US sales
                    of computers to the French Atomic Energy Agency, and things of that nature. We
                    also handled energy and energy reporting. The French were running a very
                    Gaullist policy vis-�-vis the Arabs, as if they saw the 1973 oil crisis coming.
                    But by and large, I enjoyed it. It was strenuous. But I was glad to go to Rome
                    and run my own section.</p>
                <p>In Somalia, I'd learned some Italian, and that's what got me the Rome assignment.
                    Otherwise, I wouldn't have been on the list. And I immediately got to work. I
                    got to Rome and found, to my chagrin, that I was a barbarian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went there from '72 to '75.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes, I was 43 when I got there. I'd been studying modern languages,
                    economics, psychology, sociology, and political science. I knew nothing about
                    classical languages, classical history, architecture, Roman history. You name
                    it, I didn't know it. And I spent the next three years trying to become an
                    educated man. Meanwhile, my marriage continued to deteriorate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador while you were there was John Volpe, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes. Originally, it was Graham Martin who selected me, on the recommendation
                    of the DCM. Graham Martin was a shadowy, strange fellow from the admin. cone,
                    who spent his time pulling strings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Spider King is the allusion that's made of him from
                        time to time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes, that's right. They say he'd walk into your office and speed-read your
                    correspondence upside down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he sort of scuttle away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: He would move people from other agencies around. He would pick a person to
                    be his special representative for this or that, and have him detailed to the
                    ambassador's office. He was able to do things that nobody else could do. Now I'm
                    not sure these were particularly good ideas, but he did them.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>For example, to my great pleasure, he had the program for strengthening Italian
                    democracy and US-Italian relations, by active support of the Lions' Club. The
                    Lions' Club in Italy is the little brother of the Rotary Club, and both are very
                    prestigious organizations compared to their American counterparts. So I was
                    always being sent off to give speeches to Lions' Clubs all over Italy. This
                    invariably produced some very fine cuisine, some good architecture, beautiful
                    women, and flowery speeches. I got to see a lot of Bologna and Vicenza. And this
                    was all in the name of fighting the good fight and maintaining Italian democracy
                    and keeping the influence of the United States alive. Well, I'm not sure it did
                    any of the above, but it was better than staying home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about dealing with the Italian government? There were
                        these continual “crises,” where there would be a very minor shuffle in the
                        government, yet the same government seemed to have been there since 1948,
                        and I think, except for death, it's still doing the same thing today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, Andreotti was the prime minister then, and he was prime minister until
                    two months ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we really have an awful lot to do with the government,
                        or were things sort of on a fairly even keel, so that really the embassy
                        wasn't playing any major role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, we were perceived to have a great deal of influence. And when Wells
                    Stabler, the DCM, who spoke beautiful Italian, a man of great force of
                    character, got on the phone, he could get to people. They were scared of him. He
                    could get things done. He would talk to the prime minister's diplomatic advisor,
                    and he would talk to the secretary general of the Foreign Ministry. And in that
                    respect, we were important.</p>
                <p>I got to know the people in the Finance Ministry, the Bank of Italy, the Ministry
                    of Foreign Trade, and, of course, the Foreign Ministry. My contacts were
                    excellent, my access was good. My Italian eventually got quite good; I worked
                    hard on it. I don't think my contacts were particularly effective, and so there
                    wasn't really a great deal I could do with them.</p>
                <p>This was the time, however, of the Tokyo round. We were having a big fight over
                    trade negotiations, and I was getting calls from STR all day and all night, and
                    continually going in to fight with the Italians on agriculture. And that was
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>It was also the time of the petroleum crisis. And the Italians really thought
                    that maybe the country was going to slide into the Mediterranean.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>It was also the time of a particularly acute financial crisis. People really
                    thought that they were going to go under. Nowadays, people tend to disregard
                    these crises, because the Italians have survived so many of them. They always go
                    up to the precipice, and then back off. Then they really were out on the
                    precipice, and people thought they were going to fall over.</p>
                <p>But we in the embassy didn't. That's one of the things that I did there, to say,
                    “Well, look, you know, things are bad, but not undoable. It can be turned around
                    and should be...” So that was a small feather in my cap.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was John Volpe as an ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: I liked him, he was a kind man, but he was not a good ambassador. He was a
                    self-made man, with barely a high school education. He spoke execrable
                    Italian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably with a...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Heavy... accent and very ungrammatical, and the Italians made fun of him
                    behind his back. He was unable to say more than nine words without referring to
                    his humble origins and how he was a self-made man. He had a heart of gold and
                    was a decent person, but he didn't understand much, and the Italians had a low
                    opinion of him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is November 5, 1992. Another interview with Mike
                        Ely. Mike, we've still got you in Rome, in '73 to '75. Could you talk about
                        the contacts with the Communists, the apertura a sinistra?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: That was a time when it was widely accepted that sooner or later an opening
                    to the left, a historic compromise between the Communists and the center party,
                    the Christian Democrats, was inevitable. The Christian Democrats were losing
                    both strength and credibility, and the Communists were showing tactical
                    flexibility and cleverness. There were several factions of the Communist Party,
                    but at least some of them were looking forward to joining the government, and
                    were prepared to go to some lengths to reassure the Christian Democrats that
                    they would be a viable partner.</p>
                <p>The question for the embassy was: Would we or would we not accept this opening to
                    the left? We remained opposed to it to the last, which, in retrospect, was
                    admirable tenacity, because it would have been so easy to say, “Well, look, this
                    is the way history's going. There are Communists and Communists. Maybe we can
                    preempt these people. We can pull them out of the Stalinist camp,” (where some
                    of the party was) “or split the party by bringing in the good guys and isolating
                    the bad guys.”</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>We had a very carefully worked-out system by which a junior or middle-grade
                    officer from the Political Section would meet from time to time with a
                    corresponding, probably somewhat higher-ranking member of the Communist Party.
                    They would have an exchange, and then they would go back and report on it. It
                    was very much like contacts with the PLO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Palestine Liberation Organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Everybody came with a prepared statement, made the statement and listened to
                    the other person's prepared statement. Frequently there was no more. Then they
                    would go home and would report that nothing happened. But the contact was
                    maintained.</p>
                <p>Italian politics are very personal, very complicated, very factional, and even
                    then had kind of a miasma of corruption to them, the source of which was hard to
                    identify, but you could tell that there was something there, particularly in
                    southern Italy, in the way the Christian Democratic administration worked in the
                    Mezzogiorno, the relationships between the Christian Democratic Party and the
                    church and the local administration, and then, finally, vague but pervasive
                    evidence of contacts with the Mafia crowd. These contacts are now becoming more
                    and more marked, more and more resented, and, indeed, I was in Italy two weeks
                    ago and it seems to me that Italy's coming close to some sort of change of
                    formal government. The country's falling apart.</p>
                <p>The beginning of this process was apparent in the '72-75 period. The same
                    problems that plague the country now were appearing then; that is, a weakening
                    of the public finances; unwillingness to find any serious long-term remedies
                    toward the continuing budget deficits; ineffective government; unresponsiveness
                    to both perceived and apparent needs; a growth of the underground economy;
                    pervasive disregard of civic obligations, which goes back a long time in Italy
                    and is certainly not new; the amount of income tax evasion; the amount of
                    cheating on health systems; pension fraud. Even making allowances for my
                    Anglo-Saxon viewpoint, it was bad and gradually getting worse, with no prospect
                    for reform in sight. This was what made some people think that maybe a
                    “compromesso storico” with the Communists, who were at least considered cleaner
                    than the Christian Democrats, might have offered some remedy for this declining
                    and neurotic society. It turned out, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After all, in the Italian context, it wasn't as though the
                        Communists were a bunch of people wearing overalls, sitting way off out of
                        sight. In political gatherings and just normal social life, many of them
                        were well integrated into the thing. So that, while we may have been
                        talking, you know, formal statements, there must have been a lot of
                        unofficial contacts, weren't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>ELY: Well, not much. There were people of Communist persuasion around the
                    society, but normally the ones in the Party structure, who were professional
                    politicians, were well identified, and we kept our distance from those people.
                    The Italian Communist Party had two identifiable wings; there were more than
                    that. There was an intellectual current that went back to the beginning of the
                    century, of a humanistic, idealistic, reformist, almost Utopian party of
                    Gramsei, I forget the famous intellectual who died in prison. And then there
                    were the Giolitti, and people like him, who were great friends of the Soviet
                    Union, benefitted from Soviet support, and were real hard-liners.</p>
                <p>The thought was that perhaps these two factions could be separated. In point of
                    fact, the loss of the Cold War, the decline of Leninism, and the total
                    discrediting of the Stalinist movement has led to kind of a split in the Italian
                    Communist Party. But the political system since I served in the embassy has been
                    transformed, and parallels are now almost impossible to make.</p>
                <p>I used to have exchanges with the Political Section, saying, “If the compromesso
                    storico is not acceptable to us, what's going to happen to this country? Where
                    are they going to go?” It seemed to me that there was going to have to be some
                    sort of arrangement between the Socialists and the Christian Democrats.</p>
                <p>The response of the Political Section was, “That is impossible.”</p>
                <p>And my response was, “It's impossible now, but it seems to be the only alternate
                    way.”</p>
                <p>That's the way things actually evolved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think there's a certain mindset, in any situation,
                        particularly one like the Italian, where people are saying, “Well, this is
                        impossible”? There have been all sorts of arrangements between the
                        Socialists and other parties, and I would have thought that someone sort of
                        forward looking would have said, “Well, sure, something's going to happen
                        like that.”</hi>

                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>ELY: Well, I think the numbers did it. The Christian Democrats, or at least
                    factions of the Christian Democratic Party, will do anything to stay in power,
                    and that includes dealing with the Communists. The Communists became less of a
                    wave of the future and became more static, while the Socialists began picking up
                    votes. This gave the Christian Democrats somebody else to deal with, people a
                    bit easier to deal with; that is to say, the Socialists, and their splinter
                    parties, Republicans and the Social Democrats. And by jiggering around between
                    these various factions, it was possible for the Christian Democrats to maintain
                    at least a portion of their political power, which meant patronage,
                    participation in the state enterprises, a certain amount of guaranteed fund
                    raising, which meant corruption. This was the only way they could maintain their
                    entrenched position, so they were quite prepared to do it. Again, the Christian
                    Democrats stood for very little in the way of principle. Indeed, some of us
                    thought, in a very general way, that the ideologists far behind the Christian
                    Democratic Party wanted a weak central government; they were quite prepared to
                    see the institutions of government weak and ineffective. It served their
                    purposes very well that government be discredited.</p>
                <p>In hindsight, this is a plausible explanation. But who these people were and how
                    they operated escapes me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Italy in the late '70s, in Naples, and I had very
                        much the feeling that the people down there basically, including the

                </p>
                <p>The Italians have a knack for this, but it seems to be running out. How did you
                    find, looking at it from Rome, the aspects of regionalism? Reporting from the
                    consulates and all this, how important were these?</p>
                <p>ELY: The Italians, from the standpoint of public opinion polls, are the most
                    enthusiastic Europeans of the Community; they and the Dutch for rather different
                    reasons. One of the underlying reasons that Italians, particularly Italian
                    intellectuals, looked to the Community is that they saw, in embedding Italy in a
                    larger European context, the possibility of getting rid of this corrupt,
                    inefficient central government and going to some sort of a regional arrangement
                    by which Lombardy and Tuscany and Venezia would have a good deal of autonomy.
                    Then they, with their better political systems, work ethic, and more honest
                    people, would thereby do better; they would be released from the grasp of the
                    corrupt and ineffective political apparatus, which was dominated by the
                    Christian Democrats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, almost drop the south, the
                        Mezzogiorno.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>ELY: And then the south would be treated as a less-developed region of the
                    Community, and the northern regions would require more autonomy, within a
                    European context. This was the regionalist approach to European federative
                    structures.</p>
                <p>As we've seen, not a great deal has come of this. People are still talking in
                    these terms, but the nation states themselves, the member states that comprise
                    the Community, aren't having this. The British are not about to let Scotland and
                    Wales go, and the French are not going to let the Jura and Corsica, et
                    cetera.</p>
                <p>However, the Northern League movement in northern Italy is very strong. It is,
                    however, not looking to Brussels for inspiration, it is looking to Rome and the
                    Mezzogiorno and the Mafia for repulsion. They are using separatism as a lever to
                    extract change. The measures would be more convincing had not the political
                    system—Christian Democrats and Socialists alike—in Milan been bound to have
                    engaged in very large-scale, massively corrupt practices, in the letting of
                    government contracts, in sweeping off money not just to finance the political
                    parties, but to enrich individuals. Very deep and expensive corruption that has

                <p>ELY: I never worked well in organizations that had no structure, and there was
                    almost no structure in the Policy Planning Staff. In retrospect, that was one of
                    the few assignments that I actually sought and got, and it was also a rather
                    unsuccessful assignment for me professionally. Part of it's me; I need to have a
                    context in which I can set myself goals and do them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELY: No, I couldn't. I never really got that straightened out. The September
                    Foreign Service Journal has a number of articles on the Policy Planning Staff
                    and how it's supposed to work. It seems to work in a different way for different
                    secretaries of state. Almost everything depends on how the Secretary wants to
                    use it.</p>
                <p>Kissinger had Win Lord running the Policy Planning Staff, and Win Lord was one of
                    the few people that Kissinger trusted. There was Helmut Sonnenfeldt and a few
                    others. Lord is an admirable person, honest, hard working, clean. He was frank
                    with Kissinger, and Kissinger let him tell him things that nobody else could
                    tell him.</p>
                <p>The one real identifiable function was speech writing, or ideas for speech
                    writing. And the Staff, those that didn't have their own private agendas, ended
                    up trying to write material that they hoped they could get Lord to put in some
                    of Kissinger's speeches.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>During his last year, Kissinger had a project of making a series of major
                    speeches around the country, which would be his testament. And Lord worked very
                    hard at the speeches, which were of quite a considerable intellectual level.
                    Unfortunately, the press that covers these presentations was never able to
                    handle the complexity of the thought process that the speeches laid out. The
                    press has to have one thing in a speech, or maybe two, but if you put in ten and
                    you blend it all together, the press stories are all likely to report the speech
                    differently.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, no. They will be, or perhaps they already have been, collected into a
                    volume of collected speeches of Henry Kissinger.</p>
                <p>I was responsible for foreign assistance. Did some work on energy. Did also some
                    work on technology transfer. I worried about commodity agreements. I found that
                    the EB that I was working with closely was Jules Katz. They were not interested
                    in having SP around. They considered us at best an adversary, and at worst a
                    threat. So I was allowed to attend staff meetings and very little else, even
                    though I had good personal relations with lots of people in the... I worked with
                    Bill Kontos on aid matters, and there I had good contacts with the brain trust
                    intelligentsia in the Program Bureau of AID.</p>
                <p>It was there I made my biggest substantive contribution, which passed unnoticed
                    at the time. I was part of the process that persuaded AID to support Treasury's
                    emphasis on the international lending institutions, rather than AID as the
                    central instrument of US foreign-aid policy. I thought that AID should do this
                    because Henry Kissinger had discredited the aid process so completely. Funding
                    levels were nowhere near adequate to support the kind of economic development
                    rationale that Dave Bell and the Kennedyites had brought to AID when they set it
                    up in the early '60s. It was, and has since become even more so, a grab bag for
                    various foreign constituencies, run by earmarking money in the Congress, beset
                    by difficult management problems, and highly politicized. It was a proper policy
                    judgement, from the standpoint of the interests of the country (if you believe
                    in foreign aid as I do), to make this shift. However, the Republicans who came
                    in later believed neither in AID nor in the international financial
                    institutions. In recent years, our aid performance has been lamentable, both in
                    quantity and in quality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, we're going back to the time. You were in Policy
                        Planning from '75 to '77. At that time were you looking at aid to see
                        whether it made sense? One hears today that so much of aid was, whoever came
                        in, if they happened to be a specialist in whatever, that's what we did in a
                        place. Then somebody else would come in. And there didn't seem to be much
                        continuity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Little in the way of underlying philosophy.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>When Carter came in, in '76, then you got an attempt to change the aid philosophy
                    in favor of limited development, delivering aid services to the poorest of the
                    poor, helping really poor people. A movement away from any kind of macro
                    approach, to kind of an enlightened charity program, to really help poor people,
                    to look at the basic reasons that make them poor, and ameliorate extreme
                    suffering and poverty.</p>
                <p>Well, the people that think about aid have always held that the real purpose of
                    aid is not to help people so much as to induce policy changes, because only
                    appropriate policy can result in effective development. So, bypassing the policy
                    process and going directly to delivering help to the poor and oppressed is in a
                    sense turning your back on foreign aid.</p>

                <p>ELY: There were a couple of very bright guys who were working on nonproliferation
                    questions, not just nuclear, but nonproliferation of nuclear technology, and
                    doing some of the spade work for what became a series of initially almost covert
                    meetings with major suppliers of equipment for making ballistic missiles. These
                    were young staffers who had worked for Teddy Kennedy for a while, and had been
                    in the arms control agency. They knew what they were doing, but they were
                    operating independently. We had a couple of people who tried to get Kissinger to
                    focus on human rights issues. Then, when Cy Vance came in, there was a concerted
                    attempt to turn the State Department around on human rights. Carter wanted him
                    to reconcile the view of the Department with the new added requirement that US
                    foreign policy take on human rights issues.</p>

                    opinion. But that doesn't work in Iraq, you know. Don't try it in China. There
                    was a difficult period of trying to figure out how human rights considerations
                    interact with other foreign policy considerations, and how you enforce them.
                    This is rocky trail. Both sides had to learn a lot from the other, and
                    eventually I think we got a much better comprehension than we had before. This

                    affairs bureaucracy were considered so unresponsive that Congress wanted to
                    legislate human rights into US foreign policy, a very cumbersome and inefficient
                    way of doing it.</p>
                <p>I did get mixed up a lot in technology transfer questions. This was at a time
                    when UNCTAD was trying to impose restrictions and requirements on multinational
                    companies that they turn for example pharmaceutical rights over to poor
                    countries, that they transfer their patents and proprietary information for
                    nothing. The idea was that these poor people would never be able to buy the
                    proprietary products, so if you cut the price to zero you're not losing
                    anything. This is not a good argument, but it was very popular...</p>
                <p>When I got to SP, Kissinger had just made a speech in which he appeared to have
                    conceded a great deal to the G-77 and the developing countries. This was at a
                    time when we were moving toward the tail end of the Algerian-led train of
                    efforts...redress the balance between the rich and the poor countries in the
                    wake of the first oil crisis. That led to a lot of rhetoric: Natural gas should
                    not be used for fuel, it should be used for medicine, a noble use. All the other
                    primary products after the oil producers were finally going to get a fair shake
                    from the exploiting, dominating, capitalist countries. The dialogue was
                    paralyzed by the negotiating process in Paris, which went on for years, people
                    flying back and forth with talk about commodity agreements. We eventually talked
                    the problems out of existence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... I like Paris... This was a really major assault on the
                        entire economic system, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes... very rapidly. At that time, when the multilateral corporation was
                    considered to be dominant in a system which was rootless and irresponsible; many
                    in developed countries, particularly the Democrats thought there was something
                    in this analysis. people... somebody tried to... process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about in Policy Planning, which probably is more
                        responsive to...correct me if I'm wrong, but to the political waves of the
                        immediate that come than, say, most of the bureaus, which sort of follow on
                        in their own way? Whereas, in a way, I would think you were trying to turn
                        things around; I mean, that's sort of the general idea. What was the
                        difference between, say, Kissinger and the Vance groups on the Middle East,
                        particularly dealing with Israel and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>ELY: Well, I didn't get into that much. I was encouraged by Hal Saunders to try
                    to write a paper on making the desert bloom, or how to rearrange water resources
                    between the Arabs and the Israelis in such a way as to improve the possibilities
                    of a peaceful settlement. And I carried that on when I went over to INR as an
                    office director at the end of my period at SP.</p>
                <p>Kissinger took Win Lord along with him on his famous shuttle diplomacy trips, and
                    Lord came back and reported what an excruciating process that turned out to be.
                    But as a group, the staff didn't really participate a lot. Kissinger ran that
                    one himself; Lord went along as a trusted personal confidante. But he hardly
                    used the State Department at all. As I said, I wasn't working on these matters.
                    He destroyed the Bureau of Near East and South Asian Affairs while he was in the
                    White House, and completed the destruction after he came over as Secretary of
                    State.</p>
                <p>Just as an aside, I sometimes think that I felt like an interloper under
                    Kissinger, and then, when Tony Lake came in, I was a holdover.</p>
                <p>Win Lord, for example, made sure that his people who went out got good jobs. And
                    a lot of them went out as ambassadors.</p>
                <p>Lake was interested in seeing that the people who were there left as quickly as
                    possible (be sure to turn out the lights when you go), and where you went was of
                    no concern to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Anthony Lake is now...we're talking about two days
                        after the election of Bill Clinton to be president, and nothing has been put
                        together, but Lake is one of his confidantes, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Lake is widely mentioned as one of the first circle of advisors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe how you viewed him at the time, and how
                        he operated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Lake has a good reputation. I liked him. He was distant; I had almost no
                    dealings with him. He came in and he was, I think, interested in getting his own
                    people on the staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was part of your moving over to INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>ELY: Yes. I'd been out of the Department for a long time when I came back with
                    SP. And I'd had a fairly unstructured and unsatisfactory assignment there, with
                    two administrations in two years, and never really gotten myself involved
                    closely in any issues where I really thought I was contributing anything. So I
                    felt marginalized. Also, being in SP doesn't make you popular with EB or EUR.
                    They saw SP as an adversarial organization at best, and something to be looked
                    after, something of a nuisance or at worst a threat. Made a complicated life
                    even worse.</p>
                <p>I was solicited by INR, which is not a top-line bureau; it wasn't considered to
                    be then, and still isn't considered to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Intelligence and Research.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes. I was asked if I would take over their Bureau of Economic Research and
                    Analysis. And I was intrigued, because it was a great big operation—32
                    officers—and I had a big office, and I found that they had some interesting
                    management problems, an econometrician and a group of people who had been hired
                    that were unemployed. They were trying to gear up to use computers and data
                    systems. The office had been used as a dumping ground, and the original concept
                    of a high-powered, modern, computerized research shop, which had been put
                    together by Sey Weiss five years before, had quite disappeared due to the
                    successive changes in management. It was a demoralized and inefficient office
                    when I took it over. And I thought that was interesting; maybe I could do
                    something with it.</p>
                <p>It turned out that, no, I couldn't. Well, I did some things. I think it worked
                    better when I left than when I got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you saw it in that light when you got there. This was
                        the way the situation appeared to you at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: I was intellectually curious. I saw this as a challenge. You might say I
                    chipped away at the problem, but found that without some fundamental changes,
                    not much was going to be done. Indeed, not much was done, and not much has been
                    done since. A friend of mine is now running the same office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it Bob Duncan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes. And it's about the same.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bob's getting ready to retire.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>ELY: Yes, he's getting ready to retire. He's a good officer, very smart, a good
                    economist. I felt at that time, and I feel today, that that office and the
                    Research and Analysis Office in EB should be combined and serve both EB and the
                    Under Secretary for Economic Affairs as well as other people. But for
                    bureaucratic reasons this was not going to happen, didn't happen, and will not
                    happen.</p>
                <p>I was then asked by Jules Katz to take over Monetary Affairs. I was diffident
                    about it; I wasn't sure that I really had a lot to offer. But he then approached
                    me twice, and the second time, he sort of said, “Look, this is important and I
                    want you to do it.”</p>
                <p>So I said, “Okay.”</p>
                <p>He stopped wooing me and said, “Look, if you look at the big picture, there's an
                    imperative to this. I need you. You're the only one that can do it. I've got a
                    bad problem, and you can solve it for me. So do it.”</p>
                <p>I said, “All right, I will,” and I went to Monetary Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was part of the Economic Bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes, the Office of Monetary Affairs (OMA), which essentially dealt with
                    Treasury, IMF matters, debt matters, systemic reform of the international
                    monetary system and the European movement toward financial integration.</p>
                <p>That assignment, which I took reluctantly, turned out to be one of the best I've
                    had, from the standpoint of intellectual achievement and satisfaction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Seventy-eight to '80, for a little over two years. It was a bit frustrating,
                    because I felt that I ought to move up to deputy assistant secretary. It was
                    time in my career, and I couldn't do it. They'd moved in a woman instead. Every
                    bureau had to have a woman DAS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in the Carter period. It was very emphasized, you
                        had to have...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, in a sense, that was one right against another right.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>But I found that working through the problems and then trying to transform the
                    intellectual content into policy content was very interesting and very exciting,
                    particularly since I had good people to work with.</p>
                <p>I was working for Richard Cooper, Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. And
                    Cooper is a brilliant man. Not particularly successful as Under Secretary, for
                    the same reasons that he was not successful as provost at Yale: he's not a
                    fighter, he's not an administrator, he's not aggressive. He's more of an
                    intellectual and a thinker. And for those reasons, he has never become president
                    of a university, as people thought he would one day. He now runs the Center for
                    International Studies at Harvard, where he's not really well known, because he
                    doesn't get his name in the papers. But he's a first-rate person, with a
                    first-rate mind. Because he was so good, he was influential in the Carter
                    administration. And, through him, I had an impact on all kinds of things.</p>
                <p>I acquired an interest in Turkey, and led the US delegation to the Turkish
                    consortium of the OECD. Turkey was in a very difficult economic position—heavy
                    debts, poor economic performance—and apparently moving into a debt trap where no
                    matter what it did it would be unable to pay off its debt. Its debt would not
                    only have to be renegotiated, it would have to be forgiven. But, miraculously,
                    Turgut Ozal almost single-handedly turned the situation around. We in the OECD
                    consortium gave him the breathing space that he needed. Turkey was turned around
                    in that period. This was quite a policy success for everybody, one that is not
                    much thought about these days. I guess if you avoid catastrophe that is
                    considered par for the course.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, my two years were up, and I'd been in Washington five years and I was
                    ready to move out. I'd heard that Paris was coming open, and talked to my career
                    advisor. Art Hartman was the ambassador there. We knew each other, and he was
                    glad to have me. And so I went out to be economic minister in Paris, which was a
                    lovely job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we go to that, how did you find the State
                        Department dealt with Treasury in the Washington area? You were sort of the
                        point man for Treasury, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: It depends so much on people and circumstances. Relations have only rarely
                    been very good. Back in the '50s and '60s, when John Leddy moved back and forth,
                    State and Treasury saw eye to eye on many international financial issues. But
                    there's a natural antipathy between them. Treasury is a large, proud, old
                    department and does not defer to any other Executive agency on matters that it
                    considers to be its jurisdiction. State feels that international finance is too
                    important to be left to Treasury, which tends to take a banker's, or technical,
                    viewpoint and leave out the foreign-policy aspect.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>So there is a continuing tension between them, a tension that is particularly
                    high these days, where State has been withdrawing from international finance for
                    years now, turning it over to Treasury which is becoming more and more
                    obstreperous. You've David Mulford, who specializes in repudiating agreements
                    made by his subordinates with the State Department. The result has not been
                    catastrophic for US interests, but has not been favorable. And people like
                    myself who came up the financial route, have by and large found that they'd
                    better develop a new career, because that part of the economic cone was going
                    even less far than the other parts of the economic cone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Paris, where you served as an economic
                        minister from 1980 to '84. Arthur Hartman was the ambassador most of the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: He was, for the first year, and then left. Ambassador Hartman was a superb
                    ambassador. He loved the work. An authentic intellectual, with very broad
                    interests. Good humored, approachable, quite effective with the French. He
                    stayed there less than a year, in fact; I got there, there was the election, the
                    change of administration, and Hartman left.</p>
                <p>And then we got Evan Galbraith, a banker who had served in Paris before and was a
                    friend of Bill Buckley. He had run the Goldwater campaign in Europe in 1964. He
                    was a member of the right wing of the Republican Party. I'm a Democrat, and my
                    instincts are entirely in that direction. And there was some question about
                    whether Galbraith was going to be able to work with the embassy team. Actually,
                    it worked out fine. I found Evan Galbraith to be an excellent ambassador in many
                    respects. He was good humored, energetic, spoke pretty good French (not as good
                    as he thought or other people thought), nice wife (strange but nice), good about
                    receiving people.</p>
                <p>He had, however, an aspect to him that was very difficult; and that is, he would
                    occasionally kick in as a kind of Buckleyite, hard-right, second kitchen
                    Cabinet. He had ambitions for moving to at least Under Secretary for Economic
                    Affairs, or maybe deputy secretary of the treasury, and he was trying to show
                    off his conservative credentials in Paris.</p>
                <p>One day I was out of town for the day and came back and found that he'd called a
                    press conference to essentially talk about the virtues of Reaganomics and the

                <p>ELY: They were very edgy, and Galbraith loved tweaking and teasing them. They
                    didn't like that at all; they did not have a sense of humor about being
                    Socialists. He also made right-wing speeches, which pleased the opposition very
                    much, and people would come up to him on the street and say what a great job he
                    was doing.</p>
                <p>He thought that was wonderful, but I thought it was terrible, because the
                    Socialists basically cut him out of the loop and would have nothing to do with
                    him. The Quai d'Orsay twice called him in for making speeches about the
                    Communists. The reproof was mild, but nonetheless, the Quai called him in and
                    reproved him. It went over him like water off a duck; he never realized that
                    what was happening to him was a formal rebuff. He took it in a William Buckley,
                    happy Boy Scout way, which I found quite attractive in some respects. They
                    weren't getting through to him. He was thinking of running for governor of New
                    York, which goes to show you what he really had in mind.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you're at an embassy and, obviously, you have to deal
                        with the French bureaucracy, and you have an ambassador who has, you might
                        say, a different agenda that is cutting him out of the loop, what does this
                        do to you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, it put me under pressure. I had three difficult issues that I was
                    handling.</p>
                <p>One was technology transfer, where the previous Giscard regime had been very
                    aggressive in selling advanced French technology around the circuit. The
                    Department of Defense was very worried, and Richard Cooper was trying to do
                    something about this. Eventually, the Socialists came around because they
                    discovered a very large Soviet spy ring stealing technology from France. They
                    recognized, yes, we Americans had had some points. And they cleaned those guys
                    out and worked with us more closely. That happened just as I left.</p>
                <p>The second item was the miserable business of embargoing the compressors for the
                    Soviet gas pipeline. Where Galbraith thought that was great, we were really on
                    very poor ground. There was no agreement that France should not buy Soviet gas.
                    There was no agreement that the Soviets would use gas supplies as a tool to
                    extract concessions when they maneuvered the West into a position of dependence.
                    Gas compressor technology of the '50s was not classified. The only reason that
                    we had any control over it was the fact that General Electric had to report
                    sales of this stuff under the Export Control Act. Once a week, I'd go in and
                    bang heads with Jean-Claude Paye, the Director of Economic and Financial
                    Affairs, who's now the secretary general of the OECD. He handled it extremely
                    well; he could have been destructive. He put enough pressure on so his message
                    got through to Washington, through me, very clearly, without exciting the
                    hard-liners by belittling them or seizing the moral high ground too
                    consistently.</p>

                        issue which was, at the time, at a very high level in the Reagan
                        administration: “We're going to stop the Soviets in this perfidious
                        exploitation, going into selling gas to the West. We can put a stop to
                        this.” And the French never take kindly to this type of thing anyway. And

                    rather differently than Washington, and you receive instructions that tell you
                    to go in and punch 'em in the snoot, you go in and punch 'em in the snoot,
                    because you're not conveying your views, you're conveying Washington's views.
                    And then if you want to, sometime later, over a drink, talk the thing over,
                    that's different. But you follow your instructions. You're not doing your
                    counterparts a favor if you, by winks and nods, dilute the content of the hard
                    line that you're instructed to convey.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELY: I've got one more issue to cover, the nationalization of American companies,
                    which was also difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 10, 1993, a continuing interview with Mike
                        Ely. Mike, we were just finishing up your time in France. You mentioned at
                        the very tag end that you wanted to talk about nationalization. What issue
                        was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes, well, the Socialists came in in 1981. They had an extensive program of,
                    as one of them put it quaintly, “storming the commanding heights of the
                    economy,” which included a series of nationalizations. The companies on their
                    list included several American subsidiaries. One, a subsidiary of ITT, was an
                    electronics firm that worked entirely for the government. Another was a
                    subsidiary of Honeywell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Honeywell being a computer electronics firm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: That's right. It was the Honeywell-Bull joint venture.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bull being their major computer-type firm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes, it was quite interesting. Honeywell had gone into the joint venture
                    with Bull not many years before, and had suggested that while the joint venture
                    was being put together by the lawyers, they put in something about what might
                    happen should the French government ever decide to nationalize the venture.</p>
                <p>The French said, “Oh, we'd never do that.”</p>
                <p>Honeywell said, “Of course, we understand you never would, but just to give the
                    lawyers something to do...”</p>
                <p>So they had an ironclad nationalization agreement, where the book value of the
                    proceeds was automatically put into Treasury bills (which meant more interest
                    for Honeywell) as soon as nationalization happened. Then they negotiated a
                    settlement. And, indeed, that worked out well. Honeywell continued to represent
                    Bull in the United States and sold computers, through Bull, in France. Honeywell
                    was being treated better than IBM had ever been treated under the Giscard
                    government, because it was playing the game.</p>
                <p>ITT was quite another case. It had a sick French company. It had it on government
                    contract. Rand Arescog and his people came in. They had a valuation, made by
                    Merrill Lynch, I believe, that said the company was worth something like $30
                    million. The French had another valuation, that the company was worth virtually
                    nothing. The Socialists appointed a representative, kind of a mediator. He
                    turned out to be a very flaky guy, who never showed up and didn't wear neckties,
                    quite unpredictable. The ITT people were clearly concerned. They were holding
                    out for their $27 million. They asked for embassy intervention. We declined to
                    intervene into the substance of the issue, but said that we would stress to the
                    French authorities the need for prompt, effective settlement, in accordance with
                    our instructions on nationalizations. The Socialists didn't like being told by
                    us that they were supposed to give prompt and effective settlement. They
                    listened but with gritted teeth. Meanwhile, the negotiations went on and on.
                    Finally (I won't string it out), the Socialists made an offer, which ITT
                    accepted. Later, I found the ITT negotiators were chortling up their sleeves,
                    that they thought they weren't going to get anything and that the company wasn't
                    worth anything. This led me to some inner soul-searching about the ethics of the
                    whole situation. It left me with a bad taste in my mouth, and I admired neither
                    side. But, anyhow, we got over that particular hurdle.</p>
                <p>The worst one (and I think I covered it in our last discussion) was the gas
                    pipeline episode.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you did talk about the gas pipeline.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>ELY: That was difficult. And also the technology transfer talks. Then the
                    persistent disputes over agriculture, which were a running theme.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including today, 1993, in today's paper, they're still
                        talking about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: That's right. The Community reformed the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in
                    1984, to make it less expensive, produce smaller amounts of unwanted surplus
                    commodities that have to be disposed of by subsidies of destruction.</p>
                <p>I was talking to the then-director of foreign economic policy at the Ministry of
                    Foreign Trade. He is now the French executive director at the IMF, incidentally,
                    an inspecteur des finances, an intelligent, well-informed young man, who spoke
                    excellent English, although we did business in French. He was saying that this
                    package was so good, that the Community had done so much for its trading
                    partners, that they owed... the Community a debt. The EC should get trade
                    concessions in response to this reform. This was the one serious dispute that he
                    and I had. We were good friends and tried to resolve things in a friendly way,
                    but I told him that our technicians, who I thought were very good, said that
                    that reform wasn't worth anything. It was the third in a row. About every five
                    years the CAP would threaten to collapse under its own weight, so the EC would
                    try to fix it. And they didn't. I said, you know, we think there's going to be
                    another one down the road in about five years. It was six; we were off by one
                    year. Which the French, of course, resisted seriously.</p>
                <p>The French have allowed their farmers, in part because of sympathy, in part
                    because of political considerations, in part because of, I think, the lack of
                    forward thinking, to have an inordinate political influence, which the farmers
                    proceed to exercise selfishly on their own behalf. I mean, the French seem
                    prepared to throw out the Uruguay round because the farmers, in some inchoate
                    way, say, “Well, gee, you know, we can't accept a lot of this stuff that's going
                    on, including the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy, the soybean
                    judgments against the Community in the GATT.”</p>
                <p>Who are the French farmers to say that they can't go along? The Common
                    Agricultural Policy has enriched them. It is now enriching them less. And this
                    is in response to world market forces (the way that the CAP was set up to begin
                    with, anyhow). Their answer is, “Well, don't bother us with the facts. We just
                    want money.”</p>

                <p>ELY: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we make any effort to try to look at the French farmer
                        and figure out what can be done about them? Was this something that was high
                        on your agenda as far as a concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: We tried to understand the French farm movement. And we did, and do, well.
                    There's nothing particularly opaque or mysterious. The French farm movement has
                    two poles.</p>
                <p>One is the poor farmers south of the Loire, who are marginal. The land's not very
                    good, the farms too small, and they try to survive with a couple of cows, some
                    vegetables and some cereals, which they feed to the cows, and grow some fruit.
                    These people have always been on the margin and their numbers have been dropping
                    for hundreds of years.</p>
                <p>Against them you have north of the Loire very modern, efficient producers of
                    wheat and soybeans, and a few other things, like rape seed, that are
                    substitutable. These farmers typically have holdings of 250 to 400 acres, worth
                    millions of dollars. Indeed, the high prices of cereals have been capitalized in
                    pushing up the value of the land, and these people are all extremely wealthy, at
                    least on paper. Their investments in terms of farm equipment and storage
                    facilities are very considerable. They use large quantities of modern
                    fertilizers and pesticides. And, indeed, they can compete on world markets. The
                    French will acknowledge this; in fact, they sometimes say that they may be
                    somewhat better than their American equivalents. [Can one be better than one's
                    equivalent?] I don't know whether this is the case but they're certainly
                    competitive.</p>
                <p>Here is the irony. These well-organized, modern farmers (who give money to all
                    the parties, incidentally) have actually lost their market in Germany, because
                    the Germans want high prices, and the French want no limits on production, so
                    you get the German prices and the French production scheme; lots of production.
                    The German output is enough to feed Germany, so the French output has to be
                    exported with subsidies. This is one reason that the French talk about their
                    exporting vocation. Well, if they're going to run this unholy alliance with the
                    Germans on which the Germans are now trying to blow the whistle they've got to
                    have export subsidies. That's what makes the mechanism work. And the export
                    subsidies are expensive and bitterly resented by other grain exporters—the
                    United States, but also Australia, Canada, and others.</p>
                <p>We've made Common Agricultural Policy the centerpiece of our objectives in the
                    Uruguay round.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>ELY: The round that will not die. It's been going on for six and a half years; it
                    should have been over in three. And taking the Carns Group, 14 agricultural
                    exporters, and making very substantial reforms of the CAP a prerequisite for
                    progress in all of the other areas—in intellectual property, coverage of
                    services—we put the Uruguay round hostage essentially to the Community, and to
                    some extent hostage to the French.</p>
                <p>I'm a severe critic of the CAP. It works badly. It doesn't benefit the people
                    it's supposed to benefit. It's very disruptive. It is intrusive. It is highly
                    regulated. It is protectionist. It is all these things, but I do doubt the
                    wisdom of putting it on the top of our negotiating list, because of the
                    difficultly of making progress on agricultural subjects.</p>
                <p>The Community agricultural system is at the stage of demographic evolution that
                    ours was a generation ago. They've got six-plus percent of their people on the
                    land (it varies by country, of course). We are down to three. When farmers are
                    three percent, even with a disproportionate political influence, their ability
                    to run things is circumscribed. American farmers, as a result, have been taking
                    cuts in their support programs and in the agricultural budget. The Community is
                    not yet to that point.The problem is solving itself over time. The number of
                    farmers is going down; farmers are getting older, they're moving off the land;
                    holdings are being consolidated; some land is being turned back. This process
                    will, in some way, solve or contribute to an eventual solution of the problem in
                    X years.</p>
                <p>Mounting extensive external pressure to force the Community, that is to say the
                    French, to reform the CAP has never worked. The latest rounds of EC reforms have
                    taken place independent of the Uruguay round, forced upon the Community by, once
                    again, a pattern of rising expenditure, increasing production of unwanted
                    commodities that have to be destroyed or sold on world markets at subsidized
                    prizes, provoking outcries from the other producers of the same farm
                    products.</p>
                <p>However, that's neither here nor there. The round is still underway. It has all
                    kinds of good things in it for the participants. The experts that I've talked to
                    say that the current administration should accept it even though it's not
                    perfect. The intellectual property and trade and services provisions are too
                    weak for certain sectors of American industry. They would like to see it
                    reopened and renegotiated. Very dangerous to the package. The fact that you
                    can't get the best doesn't mean you should give up the good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Mike, going back to that period of time. Here you
                        were, in a major capital, the chief economic officer of the United States.
                        Were you getting any reflections about the Soviet economy at that time,
                        between '80 and '84? Because, within five years of the time you left, the
                        Soviet system collapsed, basically because of the economics.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>ELY: Well, yes. I would say you got a rather different view from the
                    French—always have gotten. We tended to think it was self-serving: the French
                    wanted to sell them factories and technology. And when we complained about this,
                    they would say, “Well, you know, the factories are never going to get unpacked.
                    The technology is never going to be put to work.” (It turned out they were
                    correct; the Soviet Union is littered from one end to the other with unfinished
                    factories that foreigners have sold under export...) “So don't you worry.”</p>
                <p>But our people, particularly on the analytical side, in the Central Intelligence
                    Agency insisted on viewing the Russians as ten feet tall, with daggers clenched
                    between their teeth, and (particularly under the Reagan administration) that
                    anything you did that helped the Soviets in any way was contributing to the
                    strength of your adversary, who was armed to the teeth.</p>
                <p>A picture of the Soviet Union as a collapsing economy: the French sniffed this.
                    They didn't actually say it, but they would continually pull back from our
                    apocalyptic analyses of Soviet military and economic power.</p>
                <p>A team came over from the Central Intelligence Agency to show the French the
                    results of a very extensive survey they had done of Soviet petroleum resources
                    and the probable evolution of the petroleum output. I knew about this, because
                    it went back to when I was in INR in 1977 and '78, when the same team had said
                    that the Russians by 1980 will be net importers of oil. This meant they'll be
                    looking south to Iran and IraQ: We have a new threat in the Gulf. We should get
                    ready for it.</p>
                <p>My one analyst of the USSR said, “You know, even if the figures are true, the
                    Soviets will never let themselves become that vulnerable. They'll switch
                    resources. They'll do everything to keep up their production.”</p>
                <p>This turned out to be correct. The Russians did that, and a lot of bad things;
                    they wrecked oil fields in the process. Only now, ten years later, are they
                    paying the price. The Agency was off by a full decade. Very important.</p>
                <p>The CIA came and made a presentation to the French that, on paper, was ironclad.
                    They had the figures for all the fields, they had all the historical data, and
                    they projected these, and they showed that by 1982 or '83 or '84, the Russians
                    would become net importers. The French listened politely, thumbed their noses,
                    and said, “No, it's not going to be that way.”</p>
                <p>And, of course, it wasn't. So, once again, the French, with much less in the way
                    of analytical resources and intelligence [as in information, not mental
                    aptitude], rolled back US estimates.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>We thought that their estimates were self-serving. They thought that our
                    estimates were self-serving, to tell the allies that they had to do what we told
                    them to do, because Russians would come and murder us all in our beds with their
                    vast economic and military might that we have contributed to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting, because these are, as you say, both
                        self-serving. But at the same time, we sometimes get caught up in figures
                        without looking at, you might almost say, the personality side. And we're
                        talking about the personality side of the Soviet economy, which basically
                        stunk. I mean, they were unable to put things together. We added figures up,
                        but we weren't talking about actuality.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, the tendency on the part of analysts is always to cover themselves,
                    and by exaggerating the strength of the enemy, you protect your estimates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You never are off if you make them stronger rather than
                        weaker.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: That's right. If you make them weak and you're mistaken, they'll hang you by
                    the thumbs or the neck, while the other way around, they'll give you a medal. If
                    you're correct, they will just quietly retire you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question about your time in Paris. You've talked
                        about Ambassador Galbraith and his way of looking at things, but what was
                        your impression (you'd been there before and all) of how the embassy
                        operated? I mean, here was a huge embassy and all, how was it being
                        run?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, the embassy was huge and getting bigger. The Central Intelligence
                    Agency had an enormous contingent there. Everybody did. And meanwhile the line
                    Foreign Service officers, as usual, were few in number and increasingly
                    outnumbered by their miscellaneous other-agency counterparts.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Galbraith, in one respect, was a very good ambassador. He took an
                    interest in what people did. His door was always open. He was personally
                    courteous and helpful, when he didn't go through one of his hyperconservative
                    seizures, which he did from time to time. But normally he was a fine man, a good
                    chief of mission.</p>
                <p>He did drive the Commercial Section crazy by positing, in a good Reaganite way,
                    that we didn't really need any export promotion, that export promotion was best
                    left to the private sector, and that you should close the Commercial Section.
                    This caused anguish, and the Commercial people felt that they were being
                    undermined, that this free-enterprise approach to export promotion didn't work.
                    They thought that they could find evidence to support their viewpoint.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>I jumped in to support them, but on an economic standpoint, saying that there are
                    economies of scale in providing information for small- and medium-sized
                    businesses that cannot each master the information universe, and so small
                    amounts of money, which is what we were spending, would probably have a very
                    good payoff in terms of increased export activity. We should logically be doing
                    the same for foreign exporters to increase trade, but for conventional reasons
                    it's been worked out that countries promote their own exports, not imports into
                    their own country. This seemed to be working okay; the Commercial Service and
                    the Foreign Agricultural Service had management programs with specific goals and
                    objectives. I thought we could be reasonably confident that this money was being
                    sensibly spent. The Commercial Counselor was a friend of mine and appreciated
                    the support.</p>
                <p>As usual, when you were talking something ideological to Ambassador Galbraith, it
                    was “Don't bother me with the facts, my mind is made up.” But he had actually
                    dropped that particular bomb.</p>
                <p>He also had another idea; the United States was basically, on a corrected cash
                    flow basis, doing a much better job on investments than the statistics would
                    indicate. A lot of people were saying then, as they have been saying for some
                    time, that the United States was underinvesting and either had to cut its
                    investment levels down below the optimum, or borrow a lot of money from
                    abroad—which we ended up doing. Ambassador Galbraith had some figures that
                    indicated to him that on some sort of a recalculated statistical basis we were
                    out-investing almost everybody. He asked me what I thought about the figures,
                    and I tactfully said that, yes, you could make the case, but I think you could
                    make the opposite case better. He didn't lose his temper, but he didn't like it
                    a lot. He made speeches on this subject to uncomprehending audiences. He would
                    say, “Basically, the United States is doing a lot better than anybody. And here
                    are the numbers to prove it.”And they would say, “Yes, that sounds fine. But why
                    is the US borrowing all this money? Why is the dollar so high?”</p>
                <p>“Well, a high dollar was a sign of strength, not of weakness.”</p>
                <p>Well, as the financial guy, I walked him through this. I said, “If you run big
                    budget deficits, and you have a solid currency, it means it's going to lead to
                    capital inflows, it's going to run your currency up, and it may pull your
                    exchange rate out of line; there are dangers in doing this because this has
                    inadvertent effects on costs in the economy, and price-sensitive industries are
                    likely to get hurt.”</p>
                <p>He looked at me, a hard look, and he said, “What kind of argument is that?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, it's analytical. It's not an argument, it's an identity. It
                    happens.”</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>And he said, riled as hell, “Well, for some people it happened, but for other
                    people it didn't,” as if there were something ideological in my argument, which
                    was not the case.</p>
                <p>One last anecdote before leaving Paris. I couldn't help hearing a telephone call
                    that he got from Judge Clark, who was then President Reagan's chief of
                    staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was national security advisor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: That's right, he was national security advisor. Judge Clark had seen in the
                    papers that exports of French wheat to the Soviet Union were being subsidized;
                    here was another case of the Europeans subsidizing the Russians. He was furious.
                    And Ambassador Galbraith, very patiently, calmed him down and said, “Well, no,
                    in this case, although there is a subsidy attached, it doesn't go to the
                    Russians. It goes to the French producer, who gets the difference between the
                    support price and the world price.” He explained this three or four times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Judge Clark was a good friend of Ronald Reagan's. In many
                        ways he was a very effective expediter. But at the same time, he was not
                        renowned for his...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Swiftness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Swiftness or intellectual depth, particularly in foreign
                        affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, the ambassador understood this perfectly well, and he explained it
                    deftly and patiently. And he eventually got Judge Clark calmed down, so we
                    didn't get a broadside telling the French and, indeed, the Europeans to stop
                    passing subsidies to the bear to the east, subsidies that it would use to put on
                    muscle and rockets to threaten us and break down our defenses and our democratic
                    system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you left Paris in 1984, and you had what the
                        Italians would call a parenthesis. What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>ELY: Well, first of all, word came out that the position of US executive director
                    of the Asian Development Bank, in Manila, was opening up, and was I interested.
                    This would be right down my alley. Ambassadorial title, travel money, a good
                    deal of autonomy. Lots of problems with the Asian Development Bank with the
                    accession of China, whether or not China would come in, and if so, under what
                    circumstances. So there were some very interesting diplomatic problems to be
                    solved. So I was told, “This is a Treasury job, and if you want it, you're going
                    to have to go back and interview.”In point of fact, Ambassador Galbraith was
                    running a fund from putting up guests in the residence, and he had some money to
                    pay for miscellaneous embassy expenses. I understand he got into trouble on that
                    later. It was not publicized, but he had to give a lot of money back.</p>
                <p>The admin counselor took me aside and said he thought probably I'd do better not
                    to get my hand into that particular pocket.</p>
                <p>And I said, “I understand, I won't.”</p>
                <p>I paid my own way back (it didn't cost a lot of money, $500, something like that)
                    and interviewed for the job. The interviewing process with the Reaganite
                    ideologues was difficult. They wanted me to say that they should cut good
                    programs, because cutting the budget was more important than programs. I would
                    not sign on to immediately. They also asked me about my political affiliations.
                    I said I had none, having lived in the District of Columbia and been unable to
                    vote, and had not been active in the politics of either party. This they
                    considered even worse than being a Democrat.</p>
                <p>It turned out that Jack Kemp, who was then gearing up for his first try at the
                    presidential nomination, changed his team and needed to place a senior person,
                    his chief of staff, Joe Rogers, who had a doctorate in economics from Duke
                    University. So the job suddenly disappeared.</p>
                <p>Nobody told me about this. My telephone calls were not being returned.
                    Eventually, Ambassador Galbraith kindly called David Mulford, the Under
                    Secretary of the Treasury, on my behalf and got an evasive reply. We realized
                    that something was afoot.</p>
                <p>Rogers went out to Manila and was a disaster. He was so conservative that he
                    would not accept instructions about how to maneuver the Beijing regime into the
                    Asian Development Bank. He alienated everybody, and eventually left and went on
                    the board of the Taiwan Fund. In other words, he turned the position of US
                    executive director into a sinecure. It was unfortunate.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>This left me without a job. The diplomat in residence program is usually reserved
                    for ambassadors or for people that they're putting on the shelf until an
                    ambassadorial post opens up. This was not the case for me. I was asked to go to
                    Houston to help with the struggling Center for International Study at the
                    University of St. Thomas, a small, liberal-arts, Catholic university in the
                    center of Houston. An organization, Houston Inter-university Consortium on
                    Foreign Affairs, linked St. Thomas University with Houston University and Texas
                    Southern, a predominantly black college, in a common program in foreign affairs.
                    Unfortunately, the professor who was running the program was off on sabbatical
                    at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, so the consortium didn't
                    work. I was left to my own devices, so I did some reading, some lecturing, and
                    taught a couple of courses in the spring term.</p>
                <p>St. Thomas is a small and struggling, impoverished, embattled, and rather good
                    little university. I came away with great respect for the people that put that
                    thing together.</p>
                <p>The University of Houston turned out to be a large, streetcar university. I went
                    to see the chairman of the Social Sciences Department, and he told me,
                    pointedly, that they had several priorities: the first was Houston; the second
                    was Texas; the third was national problems; and then, if there were any other
                    priorities left, they might think about international problems.</p>
                <p>Although that was only seven or eight years ago, Houston was just awakening. No
                    Japanese was taught anywhere in the Houston area. The only center for foreign
                    affairs was the tiny one at St. Thomas, which was underfunded and understaffed.
                    The Houston educational system concentrated on producing petroleum engineers and
                    MBAs, and for the women, nurses. The idea of liberal arts education, except at
                    Rice University (to which I was not accredited), never occurred to anybody. The
                    Houstonians are a practical, smart bunch, but not into the classics, history,
                    English or languages: strictly practical in their approach to education, which
                    in the end was essentially anti-intellectual, I thought.</p>
                <p>It was a brief period. I got there at the beginning of September, after classes
                    had started, and I left in April, before final exams, and went back to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>The best job they could get for me was (I'd been an office director several times
                    before), running the Office of Regional Political and Economic Affairs, the one
                    that runs the European Community and the OECD, plus some COCOM matters. I was
                    pleased and not so pleased. The job itself was interesting, although you're
                    always on someone else's turf. You're handling trade matters in which State is
                    not primary. It didn't seem to lead anywhere.</p>
                <p>I found out in the corridors that Tokyo was open: they were looking for somebody
                    to run the Economic Section there. I threw my hat in the ring and, to my
                    surprise, was accepted. I had been in Japan, but really knew nothing in depth
                    about US-Japan trade problems. It took several months to find a replacement for
                    me in EUR/RPE. Roz Ridgway, the Assistant Secretary, wouldn't let me go until
                    she had a replacement. She was certainly within her rights.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>I never had a chance to do much in the way of preparation for Tokyo; I was
                    parachuted in there. I had a hard time coming in at a very senior level with no
                    preparation. There was a tendency among the people in Tokyo to say, “Okay,
                    you're very senior, you've got a good record, do it, buddy. If you've got any
                    questions, we'll be glad to answer them. But since you're such a hotshot, you
                    figure out what the questions are.” And I found out, “Well, there's no money to
                    do anything for you in Japanese language training. You can join a class with the
                    Marines.” But I traveled so much and had such work pressures I was unable
                    regularly to attend language class. I made very little progress on the language,
                    which I found discouraging.</p>
                <p>We lived in a newly-constructed compound, which still houses almost everybody. I
                    had the top two floors of a middle-rise apartment building. The accommodations
                    were, by Tokyo standards, fabulous. It was a big, modern, comfortable apartment,
                    very suitable for entertaining. But I found I was living in an American
                    compound, with sullen teenagers, aerobic dancing, and Marines playing
                    basketball, bicycles on the lawn, people walking dogs, and Fourth of July
                    festivals. I'm not against this sort of thing, but it's not why I went to Japan.
                    There were people in the compound that never left it. And living there you were
                    really out of contact with Japanese life. You had all the disadvantages of both
                    societies. After six months, I got over some of my culture shock, and didn't
                    like being there.Then I found that the work in the embassy was difficult.
                    American policy toward Japan was then and still is subject to great tension. You
                    basically had two poles.</p>
                <p>One was represented by the Political Section, the Japan Office in the Bureau of
                    East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and the National Security Council, that looked
                    (and I think, in many respects, correctly) not at the commercial and economic
                    problems, but beyond that to the security relationship and the political
                    relationship, and would not allow economics and commerce to dominate the other
                    aspects of the relationship.</p>
                <p>At the other end, you had the people who were self-serving Japan-bashers. They
                    were saying, “Look, they've got a $70 billion deficit with us, they've got to
                    buy my products.” Or “Look, we're getting no satisfaction on product X, Y, or Z.
                    Go in there and tell them that unless they do something about it, we're going to
                    do A, B, and C to them.”</p>
                <p>The State Department and the Congress had gotten to the point where they no
                    longer communicated. People like Senator Danforth felt the State Department was
                    playing its own game at the expense of American business in Japan. There was
                    some truth to that.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>The revisionist school of analysis of the Japanese economy and Japanese
                    international behavior had not yet emerged. I got to know those people in Tokyo.
                    Laura Tyson is one of them. Chalmers Johnson was the pioneer. Karel von Wolfran,
                    a friend of mine who I knew before he wrote his book, taking off from Johnson,
                    has come up with this idea that Japan doesn't really behave like other
                    countries: the structure of the Japanese economy and the structure of Japanese
                    society together are basically exclusionary. Dealing with Japan on the basis of
                    Ricardian comparative advantage, exchange rates equilibrating trade flows over
                    the long term, reciprocal foreign investment in each other, exchanges of science
                    and technology, doesn't work.</p>
                <p>I think this is right, it doesn't work. This doesn't mean that the alternatives
                    of managed trade are better. But we had then, and still have, a very severe
                    problem of trying to manage our economic and political relationships with the
                    Japanese. We tend to sentimentalize. Basically, I agree with the major thrust of
                    our policy: Japan is important to us, we're important to the Japanese, and that
                    link is essential. But when I got to Tokyo in '85, we were getting beaten across
                    the board. In any area where you can keep score, the Japanese were beating us,
                    not just trade, but investment, technology, and technology transfer. The gains
                    in all of these exchanges went to the Japanese, not to us.</p>
                <p>We couldn't get our lawyers in.</p>
                <p>We had this longstanding, nightmarish argument over containers for goods. The
                    Japanese have containers that are slightly smaller than the international
                    containers. International containers cannot be carried in Japan. This I believe,
                    but I certainly can't prove, was designed this way, to keep out the
                    foreigners.</p>
                <p>Similarly, their electrical standard is 100 volt. No other country in the world
                    has 100 volt, 50-60 cycle. So they can produce for anybody with 50-60 cycle,
                    including the American market, which has both. They can also do 110-220, 50-60.
                    But Europeans with 50 cycle can't use step-down transformers into Japan,
                    Americans with 60 cycle can't use step-up transformers into Japan.</p>
                <p>Similarly, their FM band barely overlaps with ours. So foreign FM sets cannot be
                    sold in Japan, but Japan makes large numbers of FM sets to international
                    standards that sell around the world.</p>
                <p>These are anecdotes. The Japanese economy is extraordinarily regulated;
                    everything is regulated. The results of these regulations, sometimes unintended,
                    sometimes a result that was understood and not unwelcome at the time the
                    regulations were installed, impede trade.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Similarly, speaking very broadly, it is a country without the rule of law. There
                    are only 15,000 lawyers in Japan. There are all kinds of impediments to having
                    more. There aren't many courts. It costs a lot to try a case. It takes forever,
                    and you're likely to die before it happens. They have no punitive damages. They
                    don't have a jury system. So on the commercial there's very little recourse to
                    law.</p>
                <p>This means that people deal with the people they trust. It takes a long time to
                    build relationships of trust. And, indeed, enterprises tend to congregate into
                    the Kiretsu. Interest groups would coalesce with banks and insurance companies
                    attached to them. The Kiretsu tend to deal with each other, because disputes can
                    be worked out within the family, so to speak. This is a system that basically
                    puts outsiders at a disadvantage—Japanese outsiders first, and foreign outsiders
                    at a greater disadvantage. The Japanese basically believe that if some
                    foreigners have a hard time in the Japanese market, the foreigners should become
                    more Japanese; they should join Kiretsu or form their own. They insist that the
                    main reason that foreigners don't do well in the Japanese market is because they
                    don't try hard enough; they should work harder.</p>
                <p>This is foolishness. Of course, they should work harder. We all should. But the
                    failure rate in the Japanese market is extremely high. American companies that
                    have done well have had very deep pockets and gone at it for a long time. It was
                    adversarial exporting, and only into niches where there was no Japanese
                    competition.</p>
                <p>Companies like Honeywell have done well in Japan. But they brought in new
                    technology and new products; they did not compete with Japanese competition.</p>
                <p>The only company that ever (well, not the only one, but anecdotally) Weyerhaeuser
                    managed to get into the Japanese paper market, a chunk of it, after years of
                    effort, by building a special factory and warehouse, and designing special
                    paper-handling equipment, and meeting the price. They knocked on the door for
                    years and years and did everything right. Finally the door was reluctantly
                    opened a fraction and they were let in.</p>
                <p>The area where it all came to a head was on supercomputers. I got to know the
                    trade people who were trying hard to sell supercomputers in Japan.</p>
                <p>This is a complicated story. Laura Tyson, in her recent book Who's Bashing Whom?,
                    has a rather complete and good account of it. I wish I'd had as much information
                    to work on in Tokyo when I was there. I had to work on anecdotal stuff.</p>
                <p>Seymour Cray invented the supercomputer; had a natural monopoly on it. He was a
                    science wonk from Milwaukee who spun out of IBM and set up Cray Research, which
                    invented the supercomputer and still produces most of them, although the
                    technology has since changed.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>The Japanese government had never bought any Cray supercomputers. And, indeed,
                    when I got there, there had been only two of them sold to the private sector,
                    one to Toyota and one to Recruit, which later got involved in the scandal as a
                    result of intense political pressure by Mike Mansfield directly.</p>
                <p>The Japanese had many reasons why Cray couldn't sell: the price wasn't good
                    enough; Fujitsu and Hitachi were, by that time, producing supercomputers and
                    selling them. In other words, no supercomputers were ever purchased by the
                    Japanese until there were Japanese producers, then the Japanese producers got
                    the whole market. Budgets were kept small by the research institutions that
                    purchased them. Fujitsu and Hitachi sold at enormous discounts—70 percent...</p>
                <p>Cray can't do that. It's not part of a combine. It's a free-standing,
                    medium-sized company that finances its research and development out of current
                    receipts. Cray had been pounding on the door for years and essentially getting
                    the runaround. They also were not well represented from a sales standpoint. They
                    eventually got themselves a Japanese manager as their sales rep.</p>
                <p>We had a very intense meeting with the senior Japanese on the supercomputer
                    problem, along about the middle of my second year. Clayton Yeutter was then STR.
                    He came out and we had a formal negotiation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Special trade representative.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes. Then he became Secretary of Agriculture, and then chairman of the
                    Republican National Committee. Yeutter is an extremely able, fit, strong
                    negotiator. Mike Smith, who was the chief negotiator for STR, was with him. I
                    was there with a couple of others. After we'd had formal negotiations, the
                    Japanese took us to dinner at a traditional Japanese restaurant, in a lovely
                    tatami room, and we started over again. And this time, Makoto Koroda, MITI
                    Director General for International Trade, who was famous for being tough and
                    blunt, quite un-Japanese, said, “Look, you know, we've been doing this for a
                    long time. Let's be frank. You people, and Cray in particular, are never going
                    to sell supercomputers in Japan. You're not going to do it under the present
                    system. You've got to change. Either you nationalize Cray, so you've got the US
                    government behind it, so it can go in and be aggressive and compete with our
                    companies, or you merge it with General Motors or IBM, someone with very deep
                    pockets. Otherwise, you know, you're basically wasting your time.”</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>I was amazed and shocked by this, and immediately went off and dictated a
                    telegram laying all this out, with a comment on it: “This argument gives
                    credence to those who believe that Japanese companies and the Japanese
                    government seek eventual Japanese dominance in the supercomputer industry.” I
                    passed it around. Mike Smith made a few changes, Yeutter said fine, and I sent
                    it off.</p>
                <p>It was leaked in Washington, out of the House of Representatives. George Shultz
                    sent a cold letter to the congressman who leaked it, and there was some heated
                    discussion about whether perhaps the law should be brought down upon him. Shultz
                    said, “Don't be silly. We can't do that to members of Congress.”</p>
                <p>Anyhow, the telegram leaked. It is quoted in Tyson's book, and it was clear that
                    I was the author; I was the only one that could have been the author. The
                    Japanese knew that I was not a friend, that I was a critic and, a suspicious and
                    hostile one. I knew that, at that time, my utility in Tokyo had probably
                    ended.</p>
                <p>At the same time, I got in a fight with Desaix Anderson, the Deputy Chief of
                    mission. Honeywell was going to market Fujitsu computers to the US Air Force for
                    specialized training simulation exercises. I said, “Well, this is a terrible
                    idea. If, while the Japanese are screwing us on supercomputers, we blithely go
                    ahead and buy Fujitsus by government procurement, why, they're going to think
                    we're not serious.” We should say to the Japanese, “Look, fine, we like your
                    computers, but we'd like to see a little progress on some matters in which we're
                    interested before we make this concession for you on government procurement,”
                    which is not governed by GATT rules, anyhow. Government procurement is generally
                    handled on the basis of reciprocity or unilateral action.</p>
                <p>Well, Desaix Anderson said that my telegram laying this out was contrary to
                    policy. We'd made a link between government procurement on one hand, and Cray's
                    trade problems with Japan on the other. And that George Shultz's policy decision
                    sometime earlier had explicitly rejected making such linkages.</p>
                <p>I felt baffled. I was not party to that earlier decision and felt that if we went
                    forward, we would be undermining our case. I thought about sending a telegram on
                    the dissent channel. I finally decided not to use the dissent route, which I
                    knew to be mainly employed by sore heads, not serious policy advocates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back-channel being a...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>ELY: A dissent channel. But I knew it would have ended up in the Policy Planning
                    Staff and the people wouldn't have known what to do with it. It was hard to
                    staff out. So I said, “Okay,” to Desaix, “You know, you and I disagree on this.
                    As a policy matter, I consider myself overruled, but I think I'm right.”</p>
                <p>About that time, I got a call from George Vest, asking if I was interested in
                    going to Brussels to be deputy to Al Kingon, the ambassador to the European
                    Community. I said, in a formal way, “I'd like to think about it.” A few days
                    later I agreed. So two years after I arrived in Tokyo I was direct-transferred
                    to Brussels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically, it was not a happy assignment there at that
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, it was wonderful, in a sense. I learned a lot. It was extremely
                    active. I opened a window, a new world. I worked very hard and enjoyed my
                    personal contacts there. Learned a lot about Japan, in a superficial way.
                    Without the language, you never go terribly far. It was unique, vigorous,
                    exhausting, exhilarating, but fun it was not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador for many years was Mike Mansfield.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: He was my ambassador when I was there. Ambassador Mansfield was an admirable
                    man. He didn't like to talk very much. He had very sure political instincts. He
                    was no longer young at all, nor was his wife. The Japanese venerated him. He
                    stayed above all the trade issues. But, typically, you'd come to the point on a
                    trade issue where you were very close, and the Japanese would go to him and say,
                    “You know, you've got to intervene.”</p>
                <p>And he would always say, “Well, just a minute now. If I do anything, you've got
                    to do something too. And we can perhaps together close the gap. But remember,
                    you know, you've got to do more.”</p>
                <p>The Japanese would say, “Yes, yes, that's okay.” They expected him to say it,
                    which struck them as fair. But it helped them to go back and say to their
                    people, “See, we talked to Mansfield-san, and Mansfield-san says we've got to do
                    more. Then they'd say, “All right, we'll do a little more!”</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>Then Mansfield would write a telegram, or I'd write it for him and he'd fix it,
                    saying, “You know, I understand there has been a very tough negotiation. The
                    Japanese are going to do a little more, and if we can do a little more, we can
                    fix this.” The telegram would go out and eventually the agreement would be
                    reached and everybody would be happy, except that the ambassador got the
                    reputation of being kind of the middle-man for the Japanese. In other words, he
                    was running the same technique in the mid-'80s that we had used in the late
                    '70s, and the problems were a lot worse. The Japanese wanted to maintain the
                    pattern of agreements when the Japanese basically didn't have to do very
                    much.</p>
                <p>Another problem when we were there. About the time I arrived, Jim Baker put
                    together the Plaza agreement, and the dollar tumbled against the yen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jim Baker was the secretary of the treasury at the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: The dollar tumbled against the yen, losing very rapidly a substantial amount
                    of its value. I, trained in classical financial comparative analysis, expected
                    that trade flows would eventually reflect this change.</p>
                <p>I also noticed, to my consternation, Japanese imports had been growing less
                    rapidly than the Japanese GNP. That meant that Japan was becoming less
                    interdependent. It was not becoming integrated to the world economy, it was
                    separating itself from the world economy. Unheard of! No other modern industrial
                    country has ever gone through a period like that. And when the dollar exchange
                    rate did not produce any perceptible effect, I began to believe that we were
                    really in some sort of a strange world, and that Japan and the United States
                    were not playing according to the same set of economic rules.</p>
                <p>This is a theme that was later picked up by a number of people and since '87 has
                    been studied a lot. It is now a general consensus that, yes, it is true, Japan
                    doesn't march to the same drummer. However, the argument that we therefore need
                    managed trade doesn't follow either. We've got to get the Japanese to do more,
                    we've got to do more ourselves, et cetera, et cetera. I think I buy that. I've
                    been thinking, since I left Japan, about what to do about a country that
                    systematically puts its best talent, technology, money, capital, management into
                    exports, with a system that operates across the board to exclude imports except
                    where strategically necessary, where they complement the strengths and
                    penetration power of the Japanese economy.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>Now this analysis itself is being somewhat overtaken by events as Japan and
                    Americans go into more joint ventures, where Japanese failure in the
                    fifth-generation computer becomes clearer, where you find that Hitachi and
                    Fujitsu have been chasing their white whale, IBM, down a blind alley (IBM is in
                    trouble, and they're probably in trouble too), when Japanese trade surpluses
                    really don't seem to make a hell of a lot of difference, and the Japanese
                    economy is in deep trouble. Not as deep as some people say, but still they've
                    been having big financial problems. And the natural advantages of much lower
                    cost to capital is disappearing.</p>
                <p>We're coming into a new world, where Japan is no longer about ready to elbow the
                    Americans aside to the number-two position in the world economy by the year
                    2000. Still, handling Japan remains a very serious and difficult job.</p>
                <p>Jim Baker really never paid any attention to that problem, mainly because I don't
                    think he had anybody who could do it for him. And the problem is going to come
                    back again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 22, 1993, and we continue. Mike, you went
                        to Brussels from '87 to '90. What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: I was deputy chief of the US Mission to the European Community. As I
                    mentioned during our last conversation, because of the supercomputer episode I
                    thought that my utility in Tokyo was going to be restricted. When the director
                    general of the Foreign Service asked if I was interested in becoming deputy
                    chief of the US Mission to the European Community, I decided, yes, this was
                    probably a good thing to do. Also, I found working in Japan strenuous. I enjoyed
                    it and found it stimulating, but it was a struggle. Each day, every day was
                    fight, fight, fight, either within the embassy or with the Japanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One question about with the Japanese. Did you find that
                        you had to go out a lot at night to sort of business dinners and things like
                        that? I speak from my experience in Korea, and these were a little bit
                        difficult, because it meant a lot of heavy drinking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: With the Japanese it was not the same. American businessmen had to do the
                    drinking business, both the locally resident and the visitors. We foreign
                    officials were considered in a different category. We had to participate in all
                    kinds of official entertaining, but not in going out, eating and drinking and
                    taking our hair down with our Japanese counterparts. So that part of the work
                    was not particularly onerous.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>However, I became friends with Karel von Wolfran, who was one of the founders of
                    the revisionist school of analysis of Japan. I found that I was then, and am
                    now, in full agreement with von Wolfran in his characterization of Japan as a
                    country where everybody collectively and nobody individually is in charge.
                    Dealing with the country is very difficult. An individual can hardly engineer a
                    common appreciation of what he's trying to do among people whose agreement will
                    be necessary for decision. Accordingly, you end up chipping away with
                    individuals and making very little progress.</p>
                <p>I found it (and I'm not the first) quite a frustrating experience—Bill Clinton
                    being the latest member of this club, with the Japanese saying yes, but they
                    really mean no. The Japanese are very embarrassed by that but know there's some
                    sort of American truth in it.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, I left Japan after two years, glad to have been there, wiser, maybe a
                    little bit sadder, and went off to Brussels.</p>
                <p>And that was a different kind of sad experience.</p>
                <p>I was told by the ambassador to whom I was reporting that I could not take any
                    time in transit, I had to come immediately. I took two days leave. When I
                    arrived in Brussels, I was met by a junior member of the mission, went home and
                    a telephone call came in from the ambassador's secretary: Was I planning to come
                    in right away? I did. And that began a long process, which I don't think is
                    appropriate for me to go into.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think it's interesting. I don't want to overpress
                        you, but I do want to press you a bit. We're trying to get not just the
                        foreign relations, but how the system works or doesn't work and all that.
                        So, however you feel. Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: His name was Alfred Kingon. He'd been the secretary of the White House
                    Cabinet committee on the economy. His successor was Eugene McAllister, who's
                    just leaving as assistant secretary for economic and business affairs in the
                    Department of State. Both men are quite difficult and are not thought to get
                    along very well with other people, or be effective with them.</p>
                <p>Kingon was parachuted into the job [in Brussels]. He was the second political
                    appointee to have that position. It is not suitable for political appointees.
                    Foreign Service officers say that about all jobs, but this particular one it is
                    true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I would think. I mean, you're dealing with a big
                        bureaucracy, one where you really have to know the territory.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>ELY: That's right. Your political connections in the party do you little good.
                    Your ability to understand and express complicated ideas, to be on top of a
                    whole series of areas where the US and the European Community were
                    interfacing—trade was the most important, but there were lots of
                    others—transportation, finance, regulatory considerations, trade rounds—and to
                    penetrate the complicated European institutional structures, to understand them
                    and become influential with the Europeans, is very difficult.</p>
                <p>George Vest, who was the ambassador minus two before, although not a specialist
                    on economic matters in any respect was very effective. He'd had political skills
                    with people, understanding them and getting their trust, conveying to them ideas
                    and situations. Vest was also an intellectual who could win their respect.</p>
                <p>Kingon had none of these abilities. He's an extraordinarily insecure man. He
                    trusts no one. I thought I could gain his trust over time by being responsive
                    and by being unthreatening, by being loyal. But this made no difference. In his
                    eyes it made me more dangerous. It meant that I was being very skillful in
                    trying to conceal my true purposes.</p>
                <p>He changed his mind all the time. He would bring the staff in and make elaborate
                    plans for travel programs, and then scrap them. Or the night before he would
                    leave, he'd start making telephone calls to his secretary to change the
                    reservations. She would change them several times. The next day, he'd decide not
                    to go.</p>
                <p>Kingon was both very insecure and self-important. He considered himself an
                    extraordinarily important person, and wanted to be treated that way. At the same
                    time, he was obsessively suspicious of his two ambassadorial colleagues in
                    Brussels—the bilateral ambassador and the ambassador to NATO—and saw in
                    everything they did elaborate schemes to achieve procedural preeminence over
                    him, and of their missions over our mission. He would have nothing to do, in
                    substance, with the other two chiefs of mission, and he forbade or would try to
                    restrict contact between our staff and their staffs. A bad idea, I thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, how did this affect the staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: I tried to be the buffer between the staff and this strange and difficult
                    man, who had the habit of calling all the section chiefs in several times a day
                    to have long meetings to discuss his travel plans or his social schedule, at the
                    expense of their work output.</p>
                <p>Indeed, one of the small fragments of guidance I got from Washington was that
                    they hoped that I could get the work of the mission back up to snuff; it seemed
                    that everybody was spending their time in meetings. It turned out that there was
                    something to that.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>I was not successful. For a while, I blamed myself. I now think that it was
                    mainly the person that I was dealing with.</p>
                <p>It was one of these classical no-win situations. If you try hard, you are
                    interfering, you are taking over his prerogatives and getting on his territory,
                    and you become threatening. But if you pull off, then you are derelict in your
                    duties, you're not on top of the job, and you should be replaced. Either way,
                    you could never get it right.</p>
                <p>The more senior the people, the poorer his relations with them. He got on best
                    with the younger officers, whom he would bring in without the participation of
                    their superiors, the section chiefs, and have long talks with them about the
                    work of the section, trying to get complaints from them to find out what they
                    thought could perhaps be criticized. These were good young officers. They were
                    puzzled and troubled by this process, but by and large, they did not get taken
                    in by it.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, Ambassador Kingon fired his DCM, his secretary, his gardener, everybody
                    he could fire. He fired his social secretary, his housekeeper. He would screw up
                    the accounts and then accuse his housekeeper of having mishandled them. It would
                    have been amusing if there weren't people involved and livelihoods.</p>
                <p>It was a bad period, probably the most disheartening period I ever had,
                    professionally. There seemed to be no way out of it. I was at the point where I
                    was ready to quit, and he was dissatisfied and ready to fire me. We tried and we
                    smiled weakly at each other. He never took me into his confidence, and he would
                    seldom accept any advice I gave him.</p>
                <p>For example, he used to write bad telegrams. He wouldn't take people along with
                    him when he would go out calling, and he was not a good writer. He prided
                    himself on his writing, because he'd been editor of some financial papers in the
                    New York financial area, but he wrote in a very inchoate, disorganized way. He
                    would send these telegrams off to State, for Shultz, the Under Secretary for
                    Political Affairs, and Under Secretary for Economic Affairs; to Treasury, for
                    the Secretary and the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs; to the White House,
                    for various people, for the vice president and the head of the NSC. And after a
                    while, I said, “Well, you know, that's not really the way it's done. You can
                    slug your telegrams, but you have to be careful, because very senior people
                    don't read telegrams. That's done by their staffs.”</p>
                <p>His answer was, “Look, you don't know anything about this. You've never been a
                    senior person like me. You've never served in these high levels. So, come on,
                    don't give me your advice. Your advice is incorrect. It is not wanted.”</p>
                <p>So I stopped giving him advice.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, these telegrams were being put up at the Operations Center as jokes.
                    This guy thought he was sending them all over the US government with the idea
                    that they were going to be read avidly by those senior people. He would put on
                    17 slug lines.</p>
                <p>After a while, he began to complain that he wasn't hearing anything from the
                    recipients. And once again, I said, “Well, very senior people don't read
                    telegrams, or very rarely. They have staffs that read telegrams for them, and
                    bring to their attention, usually in memo form, sometimes sending in the
                    telegram, those important items that require their attention.”</p>
                <p>He never acknowledged any merit to this argument but after a while reduced the
                    number of slugs and stopped covering the ridicule, to some extent.</p>
                <p>He had been lined up with a member of the European parliament to make a protocol
                    visit in Germany. The day before, he canceled, leaving this fellow high and dry,
                    who begged me (I don't speak a word of German) to come along as a substitute. I
                    did and had a wonderful time, learning a lot about Germany. He had to keep
                    introducing me as an ambassador. I would say, “But, but...”</p>
                <p>And he'd say, “Mr. Ambassador...” and I had to help him out.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Kingon was invited to a big conference by the European University
                    Institute in Florence, to discuss US-European Community relations. He canceled
                    at the last moment. I went down and covered for him on that.</p>
                <p>This was a behavioral pattern.</p>
                <p>He didn't get on with the US-European Community Association. He didn't get along
                    with the Atlantic Visitors Association. These were both American-sponsored
                    organizations. He always wondered what their basic motivation was, why they felt
                    that they could include him in their plans without his permission, et
                    cetera.</p>
                <p>He was not a wicked man or a bad man. He had a handicapped son to whom he was
                    devoted. His wife and he had a close relationship. But basically he was a person
                    so deficient that if I didn't dislike him so much I would pity him. An inferior
                    person. Not unintelligent, with enough intellectual capacity to make him
                    intrusive and unpleasant. You could not disregard him. He was untrustworthy,
                    suspicious, poorly educated. He could not acknowledge that he didn't know
                    anything, that there were areas that escaped his knowledge. He was always
                    lecturing people on how wise he was and how much more he knew than other
                    people.</p>
                <p>He gave me two wretched efficiency reports. There was nothing I felt I could do
                    about it, just litigate with him, and I was not going to do that.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>After Reagan was defeated and Bush came into office, most people thought that he
                    would leave. He didn't. He stayed on and on. It became clear that he wasn't
                    going to be asked to remain, but he didn't leave. Eventually, this became the
                    subject of some merriment. He allowed, well, he didn't know whether he was going
                    to stay on or whether he would take a big job in the next administration.</p>
                <p>Eventually he called everybody in and, with his usual tight little smile, said,
                    well, he and his wife had been talking this over and decided that they had put
                    up long enough with this official business. They were going to really put down
                    this burden and go back to private life, with a sigh of relief. Lies, lies,
                    lies. Quite characteristic.</p>
                <p>He'd put together an arrangement with one of the public relations firms there,
                    trying to play this period of representation into a substantive career. I think
                    he got there halfway. Then his lack of skills with people eventually caught up
                    with him. The last time I heard, he'd changed three secretaries in his tiny
                    little office in New York, where he had an associate arrangement with a public
                    relations firm.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, that was a bad time. He eventually left and was replaced by his opposite,
                    Thomas M. T. Niles, one of the best of our professionals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My problem with Tom Niles is that he was a junior officer
                        with me in Belgrade, serving what I believe was his first tour overseas, and
                        I always think of him as a young kid, just learning the trade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, he still kind of acts that way, except he's got a photographic memory
                    that works 12 hours a day. He is absolutely straight. He is honorable, good
                    humored and energetic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Mike, before we go to Tom Niles, let's talk about
                        the Kingon period. Normally, the system works so that if you get a real
                        klutz for an ambassador, career or non-career, which can happen either way,
                        there is almost a self-sealing thing, where people take over around the
                        ambassador, reports go back that maybe he or she doesn't see, the word gets
                        out, and the work basically gets done. And not just with the Department of
                        State, but with your opposite numbers and all that. Did you see any of this,
                        or was he sort of running around so much that it was very difficult to do
                        this sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, he was very suspicious of anything that went on without his knowing
                    about it, and I didn't feel free to do matters that might be questionable.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>For the first year, I was very active as the DCM in representation, getting
                    around. And people, such as the Israeli ambassador, who couldn't talk to Kingon
                    got to know me well. I got to know some of the senior people in the commission.
                    I couldn't really deal with the Commissioners; it wasn't appropriate that a
                    number-two guy do that, and that would also upset Kingon. After a year or so,
                    however, I must say I got discouraged. He didn't like that; it made him uneasy.
                    He didn't try to stop me, but the more active I was, the more problems I
                    had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Things have sort of simmered down, but they seemed to be
                        building up to a crescendo, with the European Economic Community turning
                        into a superpower. And the United States' relationship with that superpower
                        were hypercritical.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, that's true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, you've got to remember that the assistant secretary for European
                    affairs was Roz Ridgway. Roz is a very intelligent, principled person. She's a
                    NATO loyalist, and she never really has thought much about the European
                    Community. She doesn't today. She considered this essentially an arrangement
                    among Europeans, for Europeans, which could have benefits for them, but which
                    would have few for the United States, and which could also have a capacity for
                    mischief. So she never thought that the position was terribly important. She had
                    Kingon's number; she wouldn't pay any attention to anything that he said or did,
                    which was correct. The EC was very low on her priorities.</p>
                <p>She was, at the time, virtually destroying her health in her attempts to keep the
                    NATO alliance up and functioning. She was living in the period after the
                    deployment of tactical nuclear weapons, which almost wrecked NATO. And she
                    worked herself almost to death in support of the ambitious and difficult
                    campaign that we'd run with the Europeans.</p>
                <p>So EUR was not particularly either concerned or sympathetic with my plight. I got
                    winks and nods occasionally, and that was about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what was happening was the system then was saying,
                        okay, just disregard this guy and really everybody else there, and we'll go
                        our own way.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>ELY: I tried to help the staff, which is full of capable officers who knew well
                    what they were doing. The Economic Section was a mess, but the officers who were
                    assigned to it were good. By and large, the work got done. Some initiatives were
                    on our side, some were reactive. But as the EC-1992 suddenly loomed out of the
                    fog, our response was to get everybody a personal computer, with word processing
                    capability. And we doubled the output merely by applying technology. By the time
                    I left, USEC was, from the standpoint of reporting, the most productive post in
                    the Foreign Service. That is because it didn't have a Consular Section or have
                    an Admin. Section, or any representation. USIS was very small. All we did was
                    negotiate and report. And we were very good at that, and still are.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, when Niles came, it was totally different. While with Kingon, I was in
                    one kind of a no-win situation, with Niles, I was in a much better one, but it
                    was also no-win, because he's so good he doesn't need anybody. Initially, he
                    would take me along on some of his calls, and I would do the reporting telegram.
                    I found that he could do the reporting telegram better than I could. I'm good;
                    he's better.</p>
                <p>He arrived there in August and worked 11 hours a day, which was his normal day.
                    He'd get in at eight and leave at seven. His secretary would get in at seven so
                    everything would be ready for him when he got in at eight. I explained to him
                    that August, when everything was closed down there, was normally a time when
                    people would slacken off a little bit. He smiled and thanked me and continued
                    his eleven-hour days, which turned out, of course, to be very sensible, because,
                    while the Commission was not working, there were lots of things for him to catch
                    up on. He did that during that period.</p>
                <p>He was a joy to work with, except that he didn't need a deputy. You could almost
                    abolish the mission. He was so good on each of the issues, having a photographic
                    memory (he really does have a photographic memory, incidentally), that he could
                    digest and master almost any issue, pick out the critical points, and handle it
                    extremely well. These were bravura performances that I found impressive.</p>
                <p>In addition to that, he as a person is honorable, and friendly. A little bit
                    distant, in a sense. He would never drink too much or tell you a dirty joke,
                    which is good in a way, but you never really felt that you were terribly close
                    to him. But this is not criticism; I admire him very much.</p>
                <p>I was disappointed to see the rumor this morning in the paper that he's going as
                    ambassador to Sweden. I don't know what the Swedes are going to do to keep him
                    busy. He could handle Germany very well. Niles was put in charge of the Office
                    of German Affairs back in the early '70s, when Germany was...well, it still is
                    extremely important, but when GER was perhaps one of the most important offices
                    in the Department of State. Niles took early-morning German so he could learn to
                    speak the language, which he proceeded to do within a year or so. So now he
                    speaks Russian, Serbo-Croatian, French, and German.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major issues that you were dealing with,
                        with the EC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: There were issues over which the mission had very little control. The
                    central one of these was the Uruguay round and the hesitation waltz between us
                    and the Europeans on how it was going to be put together. The trade negotiators
                    on both sides tended to dominate this process. Working with trade negotiators is
                    difficult, and working with European trade negotiators is even more
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>You probably are aware of the way that these negotiations take place. Both sides
                    send forth their negotiators, who are very tough, smart people who know the
                    issues, and who each seeks to out negotiate the other or to beat the other. They
                    often have old scores to settle. And they will battle over symbolic points as
                    well as substantive points. The negotiators go at each other for a long period
                    and eventually they come to a point where they can go no further. Each goes as
                    far as he is prepared to go and feels his or her instructions permit him or her.
                    And at that time, the political people step in and say, “Okay, you fellows have
                    done all you can. Strike a deal.” Then it normally happens, except for the
                    Russians. With the Russians, you try to strike a deal, and of the distance
                    that's remaining, they want to take it all and you take nothing.</p>
                <p>For the Community, there was nobody to step in. The negotiators reported to the
                    Commission, who then reported to the Council. There was nobody who was
                    accountable for the success or failure of the negotiations, as there was on the
                    American side. Indeed, finding accountability on the European side was always
                    difficult, and this caused resentment among the American trade negotiators.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, among the Europeans, there were negotiators, particularly some of the
                    old-timers who'd been around in the '60s, for whom the test of manhood was the
                    ability to hang one on the Americans and out negotiate them.</p>
                <p>So there was always a lot of static among the trade negotiators. And even if
                    people had good instructions and wanted to come to an agreement, these old
                    animosities tended to make simple things difficult. And both sides, looking
                    ahead, would put a lot of symbolism on solutions to simple problems.</p>
                <p>We had one on EC subsidies on pasta, as a manufactured agricultural product.
                    Since the EC internal prices for durum wheat are higher than world prices, the
                    EC claimed the right to subsidize pasta exports to make up for the price
                    differential. We contested the whole idea, it was a manufactured product
                    primarily, not an agricultural product primarily. We negotiated for months over
                    how the subsidy was to be calculated and how it was to be monitored. We were
                    being fairly fastidious, careful, untrusting and stubborn, while the Europeans
                    were being devious and less than candid. So that the negotiators were trying to
                    outsmart each other. Now in this atmosphere our negotiators were reporting right
                    back to USTR...</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELY: That's right. So the negotiations were 80 percent out of our hands. And the
                    European negotiators were reporting back to their faceless bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>I was surprised and troubled by the fact that little things like this that I
                    thought should be quickly resolved could not be resolved. And it was not in the
                    power of the mission to do much about it.</p>
                <p>In addition, as the deputy chief of mission, I was responsible for the
                    administration of USEC, as it's called. USEC had no administrative section of
                    its own. The three missions shared the combined administrative section called
                    the JAS (Joint Administrative Support) Section.</p>
                <p>NATO, in point of fact, also had a military administrative section, because it
                    was a joint mission. And the military, boy, they took care of their people in a
                    way the State Department never dreamed of doing. I don't want to exaggerate
                    that, but we had continual problems.</p>
                <p>The JAS was dominated by Flemish nationalists who were entrenched. There would
                    been periodic scandals there as these entrenched people eventually...</p>
                <p>Anyhow, these guys really thought the ambassador from Belgium was the real
                    ambassador, and that my ambassador wasn't a real ambassador at all. He had the
                    title, but he didn't have a country and he didn't know the King and Queen of
                    Belgium. We consistently came off second or third best.This was a problem for me
                    and it made my life unpleasant, because I was always negotiating with the JAS
                    directorate. They always tried to cut us back, and they refused to acknowledge
                    that what we were doing was important. Well, I don't think they knew or they
                    cared to know what USEC did, which was infuriating. What we were doing was much
                    more important than the bilateral embassy, which had little to do, particularly
                    after the short-range nuclear weapons issue had been settled. We had almost no
                    diplomatic business with the Belgians, while NATO was a world rather apart and
                    didn't really depend on JAS. But we couldn't get very much from those people.
                    And Kingon was such a loose cannon. Well, they would get to him and complain to
                    him about me, that I was being unreasonable and pushy. Well, I was not. If got
                    tough on the budget, that was a problem, if I didn't get tough on the budget,
                    that was a another problem. It was a variant of the no-win scenario.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, when Niles came, he immediately straightened those guys out. He'd say
                    what he wanted. He didn't ask, he didn't even listen to their response, he just
                    did it. And they said, Yes sir, and soldiered on, because they knew they were up
                    against somebody who knew what he wanted and was going to get it. And he wanted
                    it not for prestige, but in order to accomplish his mission, which he then
                    proceeded to do superbly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mike, you were there dealing with European affairs on the
                        economic side at the time of the collapse of the Soviet empire. Eighty-nine
                        was the great year of everything falling apart, and that had to have very
                        strong reverberations in the EC and on what we were doing. Or did it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, it did. In the Versailles Summit of June '89, as the East was
                    coming...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the economic summit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: The G-7.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was major nations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Yes, Mitterrand hosted it at the Arche in Paris, and put on a big
                    celebration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it was the bicentenary of the French Revolution,
                        the fall of the Bastille and all that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: That's right. One of the main substantive results of that summit meeting was
                    the decision to coordinate all aid to Eastern Europe—Eastern Europe initially,
                    and eventually others of the ex-Soviet Union—through the European Community. All
                    the European member states plus the United States agreed that we would work
                    together jointly. This was done in part for reasons of efficiency and in part
                    because the United States didn't have a lot of money, didn't know quite what it
                    wanted to do, and felt that basically this was a European responsibility that
                    would be best, at least in the first instance, assured by getting the Europeans
                    to be formally responsible for it.</p>
                <p>By that time, the EC-92 exercise was fully underway and the early fears of
                    Fortress Europe were beginning to recede. We did a lot of indirect work on
                    Fortress Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what Fortress Europe meant?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>ELY: Yes. The Europeans, as early as 1985, had decided that they would take the
                    measures envisioned in the Treaty of Rome to form an economic union, and this
                    they would do by the end of 1992. They didn't get agreement among all their
                    national parliaments by '86, and the program didn't begin, in a serious way,
                    until '87. Even then, it was hung up by the disputes among the Europeans, but
                    particularly the British, over the budget and the financing of the agricultural
                    program.</p>
                <p>In Denmark, in the spring of '88, these issues which had been plaguing the
                    Community for years were suddenly solved and fell away. People immediately
                    turned to constructing the single European market, the unified market, with a
                    target of implementing several hundred directives by the end of 1992. This
                    involved basically converting the European Community into a single market for
                    labor, goods, money, and people, which is a fairly complicated business. It
                    involves dismantling of impediments to movement within the Community for these
                    four factors. Indeed, there are still a few obstacles to the movement of people.
                    For example, the British won't let European Community citizens in unscreened in
                    Dover, for reasons that I can understand.</p>
                <p>The immediate reaction was, well, gosh, if the Europeans are going to turn the EC
                    into one market, very much like the United States (the single market is as
                    unified a market as the American; in some respects more so), how will this be
                    done? When they have to make a decision about whose ox gets gored; will it be
                    the foreigners, or an open system?</p>
                <p>By and large, under the influence of the Germans and the British, the
                    single-market exercise was liberal and outward-turned. There were and still are
                    several areas which cause acute concern in Washington. One was the financial
                    services directive, in which the Europeans initially specified that they would
                    require reciprocal treatment in order to give liberal treatment to foreign banks
                    and financial institutions. The use of reciprocity in financial services was
                    bitterly resisted by the United States. Our Treasury has always held to the
                    principle of national treatment: you treat foreigners the same as you treat your
                    own people, and because of regulatory prerogative, you don't talk about
                    reciprocity. For example, the states in the United States have considerable
                    authority over banking and insurance. We could not give mirror-image reciprocity
                    to the Europeans. They could take away access to their market on the argument
                    that their access to the United States' market was impaired by the states. The
                    Europeans winked and nodded and said, “Well, they were really basically aiming
                    at the Eastern Europeans, the Chinese and the Japanese, not the Americans.” That
                    may have been true, but American banks were acutely concerned about the
                    principle and the practice of this directive. Sir Leon Britton, who is now
                    negotiating with Mickey Kantor, was the competition commissioner who had a big
                    voice in framing this directive. He eventually intervened and watered it down to
                    the point where there was a fig leaf of reciprocity but in such a way as to
                    assuage the fears of the American financial community. Both sides seem to have
                    come out all right.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>There were several other issues, including European local content requirements
                    for certain electronic components, particularly semiconductors; flirting with
                    various kinds of industrial policies that took place (they were never actually
                    implemented, but they appeared to be in the process of formulation); the fact
                    that the Community maintained very substantial tariffs on electronic goods when
                    we and the Japanese had gone to zero tariffs (this raised questions about their
                    intentions).</p>
                <p>On television broadcasting, the French pushed for and achieved the principle of
                    national or European quotas, to assure European content to television
                    broadcasting, a measure which we found both insulting, because it gave, say, the
                    Portuguese better coverage in Europe than the United States, and protectionist,
                    because it seemed aimed at the enormous quantity of movies we have stored away
                    and which we were selling to the Europeans; and to reflect a French idea that
                    American culture is basically bad, and Europeans should be protected from it and
                    its corrupting nature by trade barriers.</p>
                <p>Jack Valenti, the very powerful head of the Motion Picture Producers Association,
                    visited Brussels several times. Dealing with Valenti is difficult; he's a very
                    deft and skillful political operator with no particular interest in US-EC
                    relations.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the Europeans kept telling us, “Well, look, this is better than the 12
                    national systems that its replaces. The intent is not protective. We had to
                    compromise somewhere. We went a long way toward your viewpoint. This is going to
                    do you a lot of good; it is not going to hurt you.”</p>
                <p>Then Valenti would come back and say, “Well, on the principle, we refuse the idea
                    that because films are made in the United States they might be excluded on the
                    basis of geography from the European market.” Both sides have merit in their
                    argument. It still has not been decided.</p>
                <p>At that time, the Europeans were debating about government procurement. This has
                    turned out to be the issue that Kantor and Brittan are now trying to work out
                    among themselves.</p>
                <p>It's an interesting example of, on the one hand, the American side rejecting the
                    Europeans writing into their 1992 directives a small amount of exclusive
                    protectionism. They'd always had a lot of protectionism, but none of it had been
                    explicit. It had all been informal, in government procurement. They didn't have
                    rules like we have such as “Buy American.” On the other hand, they never bought
                    anything from us. We had rules about how, with certain kinds of contracts, we
                    provide advantages to American bidders. So the Europeans didn't win many
                    contracts, but they won some. So they were basically doing better than we were:
                    our sellers never won any.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>They wrote this provision into their directive, and then offered to negotiate, to
                    try to get rid of the “Buy America” stuff. This is trade negotiator footwork.
                    They gave themselves a crowbar to pry open the American market, but they dared
                    to be closed all these years. In these circumstances, it is very easy for both
                    sides to become patriotic and assertive in defending their claims against the
                    unreasonable foreigners.</p>
                <p>This is, again, an example of small issues that, because of the footwork at the
                    staff level, tend to escalate and become difficult to solve.</p>
                <p>Similarly, the president reopened the Airbus issue.</p>
                <p>The Airbus issue goes back a number of years. The Europeans basically shot their
                    way into the international civil aviation market by heavy subsidies to a
                    consortium of European suppliers that manufacture the Airbus. They did this in a
                    way that was closely linked to industrial policy. They wanted the advanced
                    technology that goes into making civil aircraft, as well as a part of the civil
                    aviation market. It played to constituencies in France and Germany that were
                    very strong. The Europeans just went ahead and did it.</p>
                <p>Eventually, last July ['92], after years of negotiations, we came up with an
                    agreement in which neither side agreed to the merit of the other's arguments but
                    at least it settled the situation.</p>
                <p>The president reopened that in February ['93], in Seattle, when he accused the
                    Europeans of causing unemployment in the American aerospace industry. A lot more
                    unemployment came from the depressed state of the worldwide air transport
                    industry than from Airbus. But also, he [Bush] settled that thing last July and
                    he [Clinton] reopened it in February, accusing them of the same things that we'd
                    been accusing them of over the years.</p>
                <p>They responded with the same arguments, that we had been cross-subsidizing from
                    our military programs, which gave us an overwhelming advantage.</p>
                <p>We said that they had put in $36 billion in subsidies, a figure that they contest
                    and have American lawyers employed to contest a figure that they contest
                    vociferously.There we were the way we were a year before, yelling about the
                    figures and who struck whom until we agreed to put the whole thing to bed and go
                    on to something else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were sitting sort of at the hub of the economic
                        thing, looking at overall Europe and all this, were we getting intimations
                        of basically the economic collapse of the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>ELY: Certainly not in Brussels, not where we were sitting. The Community at that
                    time didn't even have an office in Moscow, and had no formal mandate to look at
                    the Russian economy. We did pick up a lot from their visiting missions. They
                    would go to Moscow to talk about various projects, or to Warsaw, Prague, or
                    Budapest. There were exchanges, impressions, and information, but none of this
                    was strategic.</p>
                <p>There was the beginning of talks on Yugoslavia which was falling apart when I
                    left.</p>
                <p>The one big politically macro question that we did get mixed up in was the
                    preparations for the intergovernmental modifications of the Treaty of Rome that
                    took the form of the Maastricht Treaty, signed in December of 1991. The
                    preparations for that were underway in 1990 when I left Brussels.</p>
                <p>It involved essentially a two-track process of negotiating a Franco-German idea
                    of an economic and monetary union, with a timetable, procedural steps on how
                    this was to be arrived at, and a flanking set of measures which would lead
                    toward a union with responsibilities for foreign policy and security and
                    eventually defense.</p>
                <p>Our colleagues in the NATO Mission were already getting uneasy about the defense
                    aspects.</p>
                <p>This is the one substantive issue that I'm still mixed up with today in my
                    retirement activities with the Monnet Council.</p>
                <p>The NATO alliance is probably the most successful alliance of its sort that we've
                    ever experienced. And over a period of 40 years, the Department of Defense and
                    the State Department had put their best people and their best efforts and a lot
                    of money into making that alliance work. We provided people, leadership and
                    money, but we were also careful not to dominate, not to run it like a bunch of
                    Russians. We had and have an old-boy network, a unified command establishment,
                    experience in working with each other, relationships of trust and understanding
                    that have been built up over the years. And, indeed, NATO had turned into a
                    really major asset for the Europeans and for the United States.</p>
                <p>The only problem is it has no purpose. It has nothing to do now. It has
                    succeeded. The reason for its establishment—that is, to counter the Soviet
                    threat—has now disappeared; the Soviet threat is gone. There are other threats,
                    different kinds, to which NATO barely responds, in some respects.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>In 1990, my clash with the NATO loyalists in the State Department began when I
                    sent off a telegram, with the encouragement of Ambassador Niles, saying that,
                    Europeans were moving down the 1992 road, they're going into a Maastricht
                    unification process, and sooner or later, they were going to come up with an
                    idea for their own security and defense establishment. This was a long way down
                    the road, but we should understand that it was coming. It would be a mark of
                    manhood for a European Union. So when the Europeans start saying that they wish
                    to develop for themselves a defense identity, we should understand this as a
                    legitimate culmination of what the Europeans have been doing for a number of
                    years, and the culmination of a policy direction in which we have either
                    acquiesced or where we've encouraged them to move. In other words, a separate
                    European defense identity linked to or even within NATO was something we should
                    be thinking about.</p>
                <p>Well, this turned out to be right, but the timing was off. The telegram never
                    received a reply, and, indeed, the lack of a reply was emphatic. I had said
                    something that nobody wanted to say, that the Europeans might want to get
                    together a caucus within NATO, that they might want to eventually put together
                    some sort of arrangement within NATO. The NATO loyalists were appalled at this
                    idea. In other words, the thought was good, but it went to the wrong people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: I left in September of '90.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you make your transition? Did you figure out what
                        you wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, I knew that I was probably going to retire the next fall, on time in
                    grade, since I hadn't gotten an ambassadorial nomination of any sort. I
                    recognized that after Tokyo and then after this telegram that I'd sent, saying
                    indecent things (which are particularly bad when they're true), that I didn't
                    have any friends in the European Bureau. So I decided, well, might as well be
                    realistic. I got back and there were no jobs. It didn't surprise me. It made me
                    a bit wry, because, you know, I know a lot about international economics, more
                    than a lot of people that are doing it. But I was perhaps too proud to ask, and
                    I was getting no offers. And so, when a think tank at the National Defense
                    University actively recruited me, I figured this was probably a very good
                    transition place to learn new ways of acting.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>Anyway, I went down there and spent a year getting ready to leave. I didn't have
                    a lot to do; I didn't have any formal duties. I worked eight hours a day and
                    turned out a number of memoranda, but I was way, way down the line. I actually
                    had the assimilated rank of colonel, I think GS-15, which was way under my
                    personal rank. But I understood that, down there, you don't complain about your
                    personal rank. You accept it. You don't take it and then complain about it
                    afterward. So I learned to use a word processor, which was a good thing. I'd had
                    a personal secretary for 25 years. And I learned to think of myself not as a cog
                    in a larger system, but as a person in my own right. I went house hunting and
                    re-Americanized myself. By and large, that turned out to be not too bad an idea.
                    It worked out all right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then, just to give a final thing, you went into
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, I'd received my telephone call in January of '91, saying that I was
                    being retired for time in class in September. I wished I'd been able to stay on
                    a little bit longer, because of the extraordinary pay raise that took place on
                    the first of January, which I got nine months of. It would have increased my
                    retirement by a very large amount.</p>
                <p>I was approached in the spring of '91 by a former ambassador to the European
                    Community; would I be interested in becoming the executive director of a small,
                    nonprofit organization dedicated to the work of Jean Monnet, the father of the
                    European Community, who had the vision of a united Europe in transatlantic
                    partnership with the United States, an idea that I always felt had an element of
                    truth to it that could not be denied. I still believe that if the world is to
                    become a better place, it's going to be largely a function of the ability of the
                    Europeans and the Americans to cooperate to make it that way, to pull in the
                    Japanese, and to handle Russia and China and the emerging problems and
                    threats.</p>
                <p>Well, I was totally unprepared for that kind of a job. I've never been in the
                    private sector. I don't know anything about fund-raising; I'm not good at it. I
                    can write good memoranda and do excellent analysis, but it wasn't clear and it's
                    still not clear that this is what is required for that particular job. And the
                    pay was uncertain; still is. But it had the great advantage of having me work
                    with people that I know and like and admire, on work that I find agreeable,
                    congenial, which I think has significance.</p>
                <p>I'm not sure the organization's going anywhere. I've been with them for two years
                    now. It has kept me in the circuit, and I don't regret it for a minute. I may,
                    in fact, however, just go into full retirement before too long and do the things
                    that I said I was going to do; that is, learn German and take voice lessons,
                    divorce myself from the Foreign Service and lead a completely different kind of
                    life.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one last question, sort of going back to the EC
                        period, and it's just a fill-in. Where did Canada come in on this? I always
                        think of one of the great themes that I try to explore when I'm doing these
                        oral histories, negotiating with the Canadians, which seems to be a
                        particular problem all the time. And I was just wondering, did Canada fit
                        into the EC thing at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: Well, first of all, when Tom Niles came to Brussels, his previous post had
                    been Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador to Canada.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELY: He had been witness to the negotiation of the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement
                    (FTA), which was a traumatic experience for the Canadians and still remains
                    controversial in Canada. It was extraordinarily difficult on the American side
                    to negotiate, because of the continuing conflicts within the US government about
                    how everything was supposed to work.</p>
                <p>The Canadians in Brussels had a mission almost as large as ours. They were very
                    active. The Canadians had, off and on, been trying to play a European card,
                    because of the predominance of the United States in their foreign economic and
                    political relations. By the time of the FTA, it was quite clear that they were
                    no longer counting on this particular card, because they'd already made a
                    decision to go toward closer relations with the United States.</p>
                <p>So the Canadians were a diffident bunch. As always, their diplomats were very
                    good.</p>
                <p>I found the Australians much more abrasive. The Australians were among the
                    leaders, in the Uruguay round, of the agricultural countries that attacked the
                    Common Agricultural Policy.</p>
                <p>And the Canadian mission was full of people who were bitter about the cynicism of
                    the Europeans in the way that they ran their agricultural affairs. The Canadians
                    had much less of the commonwealth ideal that they were basically Europeans like
                    the Europeans. The Canadians didn't like the Common Agricultural Policy, because
                    they're big grain exporters, but they would often direct their ire to the United
                    States. When we would counter European export subsidies, the Canadians would
                    blame us rather than the Europeans. They'd blame the Europeans, too, but they
                    basically threw both of us into the same pot, while the Australians made a clear
                    distinction and would anathematize the Common Agricultural Policy in a way that
                    I found bracing and pleasant.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>The Canadians worried about Fortress Europe the way we did. They looked with
                    diffident envy at the special arrangements we had with the Community for
                    consultations, where the Secretary of State would drop by after the NATO
                    ministerial in December, and we would get the occasional presidential contact.
                    There would only been one presidential visit before I got there. That was Jimmy
                    Carter, back in 1978. Bush was a good Atlanticist; he understood the Community,
                    he was all in favor of it. Bush sort of told his staff, let's do this, and
                    visited the Community in 1990. That was a small triumph for those on both sides
                    in trying to get the two organizations together.</p>
                <p>Working out relations between the United States and the Community has been a
                    torturous task. First, you had EC-92, and then, from that, the prospects of
                    monetary unification, and from economic and monetary unification, you need some
                    sort of political mechanism. With Maastricht, it looked as if Europe was going
                    to be moving toward some sort of federative system. And it raised the ideas: how
                    are we going to work together? How are we going to cooperate? And in the
                    background, was this smoldering problem of defense and the desire of the
                    American side, particularly the Department of Defense people, to keep NATO
                    intact as an instrument of US-European relations.</p>
                <p>With the impact of the Danish referendum a year ago, which turned down
                    Maastricht, the falling away of British support for the treaty, the German
                    preoccupation with the problems of unification and second thoughts about
                    monetary unification, the fact that Italy is recreating itself before our eyes,
                    and the French have turned out Socialists in a massive vote of no confidence.
                    Meanwhile Mitterrand is aging and ailing, Europe is in a period of depression
                    and drift, and it's easy and tempting for us to say this is the time for us to
                    reestablish the special relationship with the British, pull the Germans away
                    from the French with their protectivist agriculture and their residual and
                    automatic anti-Americanism, to reestablish our positions with the major European
                    powers, and to disregard the European Community, which seems to be going
                    nowhere.</p>
                <p>I think that would be a major mistake. In our own way, the United States needs a
                    unified European Community as much as the Europeans do, for rather different
                    reasons. We need a responsible, accountable and reliable interlocutor to handle
                    such questions as: What do we do about Russia? How do we reform the world
                    trading system? What do we do about environmental questions? What about
                    transnational issues such as proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
                    migration issues that national authorities can't handle, a whole series of
                    present and potential problems that cry out for cooperation between the United
                    States and a united Europe—about the same economic size, about the same
                    population, and with a rather different set of democratic institutions and
                    traditions, but traditions that fit nicely with ours.</p>
                <p>The United States is no longer in a position, nor should it be in a position, to
                    provide single-handed leadership for the world. We need to work out, with our
                    friends and allies, the kind of world that we're looking for. George Bush had a
                    vision of this. I'm sure Clinton is going to end up moving in exactly the same
                    direction.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>But this is not American hegemony, this is not American ideas being sold around
                    the world. We're going to have to go into a long process of back and forth. And
                    our principal interlocutor in the first instance, will be the Europeans. Unless
                    we can work it out with the Europeans, I don't think we're going to have much
                    luck with the Japanese.</p>
                <p>If we can finally get the Japanese to come in with the two of us, then we'll be
                    in a position to start saying, liberal democracy is what we want, an open world
                    is what we want, and this is what the necessary reform is going to be: we want
                    to talk to you about it before we impose it upon you. We are no longer going to
                    put up with the lack of legitimacy of these countries in the Third World that
                    are trying to manipulate the world system. We want a system that is more just,
                    less bloody, more peaceful. And I think we can do it, with the Europeans,
                    also.</p>
                <p>I am fascinated with Monnet's ideas of the use of innovative kinds of federalism
                    and federal structures to reduce the inherent characteristics of the
                    nation-state. Monnet considered the nation-state to be responsible for much of
                    the disorder and bloodshed of the modern era. He saw the European Community as a
                    first step, and only a first one, in moving away from the nation-state system
                    toward a system of federated institutions based on common objectives. This idea
                    remains good. The Community is the one area that has not been breaking up.
                    Although the leadership in the principal countries is in confusion, the
                    Community itself is doing well. At a time when the Soviet Union is breaking up,
                    Eastern Europe is dividing, Yugoslavia is exploding, India appears to be in
                    trouble, you have terrible problems in Southern Africa, Iran may be breaking up,
                    China is being subjected to great strains, the idea of getting people together
                    to identify problems and decide how they're going to set up rules and
                    institutions to deal with the problems becomes increasingly attractive.</p>

                    told you more than I know.</p>
