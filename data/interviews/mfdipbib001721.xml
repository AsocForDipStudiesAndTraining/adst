                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, today is 22 October 2009. This is an interview with
                        Mark E. Mohr. This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and Training and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. And you go by
                        Mark?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mark, let's start at the beginning. When and where were
                        you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Brooklyn, New York, January 5, 1945.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, let's take the Mohrs. What do you know about the
                        background of the family?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MOHR: My parents were Jewish. Although my mother was born in New York City, her
                    parents came to the United States from Bessarabia at the end of the 19th
                    century. Bessarabia was then part of Romania, and is now the country of Moldova.
                    My mother, who was born in 1906, had a difficult life, as her mother died during
                    the influenza epidemic of 1919. She was the oldest child, so my grandfather told
                    her, at age 13, that she now had to take care of him and her younger brother.
                    Then my grandfather remarried. He eventually had five more children, and my
                    mother had to take care of them as well. She eventually had to drop out of
                    school because of her responsibilities at home.My father was born in 1903 in
                    Galicia, just outside of Cracow, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian
                    Empire, and is now part of Poland. His life was no picnic either. He was a
                    teenager during World War I (WWI). The Russians invaded his village, which was
                    south of Cracow, captured the civilian population, and moved the people,
                    including my father, his parents, and his two sisters and brother, to a Russian
                    town called Ufa, which is at the foot of the Ural Mountains, on the European
                    side. He said it wasn't that bad. There were some Red Cross inspections to
                    monitor that the captives were well-treated, and the only problem, according to
                    my father, was an occasional shortage of food. There was one incident, as told
                    by my father, which scared me. He was walking with an adult who had a loaf of
                    bread. My father heard a shot, and the man fell down, bleeding. “What did you
                    do?” I asked my father. “I picked up the loaf of bread and ran,” he replied.</p>
                <p>At the end of WWI my father and his family were repatriated back to their
                    village. My father was now a citizen of Poland, as that country became
                    reconstituted following the end of the war. One of the first foreign policy
                    initiatives of the new Polish government was to declare war on Russia. My father
                    received his draft notice. Deciding that he had already been a guest of the
                    Russian government, and recalling he had an uncle in New York City, my father
                    decided to go west rather than east. It was a wise decision. In 1939, when
                    Hitler invaded Poland, the initial point of attack was southern Poland, in the
                    Cracow area. If my father had not departed in 1921, there is little doubt that
                    he would have been killed, most probably in the concentration camps, and I would
                    have never been born.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your father do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Because of World War I, he had no chance at an education. His uncle in New
                    York owned a bar, and after my father arrived, he worked there for several
                    years. Then he decided to learn a trade, and became a paperhanger. He decorated
                    houses with wallpaper. He was quite skilled, and made a good living. My mother
                    was a housewife. If you recall the television show Welcome Back Kotter, there
                    were shots of an outdoor market as the theme song played at the beginning of the
                    show. That was the 86th Street market in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, where my mother
                    did her food shopping every day for the evening meal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that the old Jewish neighborhood more or less?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>MOHR: Yes. We lived on 81st Street, and it was a mixed Jewish-Italian (Sicilian)
                    neighborhood. For whatever reasons, the Jews and Italians got along very well.
                    Therewere never any fights. My best friend, who lived three houses down from me,
                    was Nicky Manucci. I was always eating at Nicky's house, which annoyed my mother
                    greatly. However, I definitely preferred Italian cooking to Eastern European
                    cooking. In my mind, the latter's great mantra was “boil everything.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the early years. How big was your family?
                        Your mother and father both died while you were quite young.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I had a sister who was 16 years older than I, and a brother who was 14
                    years older. So my parents were fairly on in years when I was born. My sister
                    married when I was five. My father died of a heart attack at the age of 52. I
                    was 10 at the time. My mother died, also at the age of 52, two years later, of
                    breast cancer. My sister and brother, unfortunately, are both deceased now as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of place did you live in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: It was a lower middle class neighborhood in Bensonhurst.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it an apartment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, although most places on my street were one or two family houses, we
                    lived in a three-story walk-up, on the first floor, in the back. I think the
                    neighborhood now is mainly Russian-Jewish. After I left, the district was
                    represented by Congressman Steven Solarz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have interviewed Steve Solarz.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I also took care of him several times during visits overseas; the last one
                    was to Beijing in 1988. He really liked to do a lot, and it was a bit tiring
                    escorting him on his many appointments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall as a kid, life in your neighborhood?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MOHR: Yes. In the 1950s television was still relatively new, and it was not on
                    all day. The habit of just watching television was not yet ingrained. We would
                    play outside a lot, on the street. It was great fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you played stick ball?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Stick ball, and stoop ball as well. But mostly stick ball. When cars passed
                    by, we would stop playing until they passed. After my mother passed away, I
                    moved permanently to live with my sister in Elizabeth, New Jersey. On my first
                    night after dinner, I hurried out on the street to meet and play with my new
                    friends. I received quite a shock: there was no one out on the street. So even
                    though I moved less than an hour by car from my home in Brooklyn, I knew I was
                    in a different place, with a different culture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of a place did your sister live in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: My brother-in-law was a doctor, so they lived in a fairly spacious house in
                    an upper middle class neighborhood, mostly doctors and lawyers. It was atypical
                    of Elizabeth, as most of the town at that time was fairly shabby.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a kid were you much of a reader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Actually no, unless you count comic books. I loved Superman, Batman and
                    especially Captain Marvel (Shazam!). I was particularly upset when Captain
                    Marvel stopped publishing in 1955. I actually wrote a letter to the publishers
                    of Captain Marvel, and learned in their reply that they had been sued for
                    plagiarism by the publishers of Superman. Amazingly, the latter won the lawsuit,
                    and Captain Marvel had to stop publishing. At a young age then, I lost a little
                    faith in the American judicial system. The lawsuit was ridiculous: aside from
                    both being superheroes, Captain Marvel was nothing like Superman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In elementary school were you a good student?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Oh yes, always. My sister and brother were not good students, so my parents
                    were always very happy to receive my report cards. My sister always wanted to be
                    a nurse, so she did well enough to get into nursing school, but she was never
                    very academic. My brother, who was amazingly intellectual (no comic books for
                    him), nevertheless liked to argue with his teachers, especially pointing out
                    things that they said which he believed were incorrect. So he never got straight
                    As, like I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Unfortunately, my academic ability, manifest at a young age because I could read
                    by the time I was three or four, made my father decide that I had what it took
                    to be a rabbi. I suppose this was very prestigious from his point of view.
                    Accordingly, he decided that he would send me to Yeshiva, that is, orthodox
                    Hebrew school, rather than send me to regular elementary school.</p>
                <p>I have to interrupt the narrative at this point to relate an event that almost
                    caused my death. At the age of five, my family and I were vacationing in the
                    Catskill mountains, north of New York City. While playing in the woods, I was
                    bitten by a bee, and developed a severe allergic reaction. I was hospitalized,
                    and soon developed nephrosis. That is, my kidneys basically shut down. This was
                    in 1950, and fortunately for me, a new medicine had been developed. It was
                    called ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). Unfortunately, it was very expensive,
                    and my father could not afford it. Fortunately, my future brother-in-law was in
                    residence at the hospital where I was, and he just took some ACTH from the
                    medical supply room and provided it for me. The ACTH cured me, although it took
                    almost a year. Later I learned that most of the children on my ward died. They
                    were in advanced stages of nephrosis before the ACTH became available. My
                    brother-in-law told me that my case was written up in a medical journal. I was
                    the first child to make a complete recovery from nephrosis.</p>
                <p>So after recovering from the illness, I was off to Yeshiva. The hours were from
                    8am to 5pm daily, and there was tons of homework, including at least one hour
                    per night of Hebrew memorization from the Old Testament. I really grew to
                    dislike my school life a lot, so when my father passed at the end of sixth
                    grade, I wasted no time insisting that my mother allow me to transfer to public
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this one place where as a little kid you are nodding
                        your head back and forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: No, nodding you head back and forth is when you pray. As I said, there was
                    a lot of memorization, so that was standing up and reciting like a robot.
                    However, later in life I realized this trained me well for learning Chinese, my
                    specialty in the foreign service, because that too required an incredible amount
                    of memorization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the religion you were studying “take” in any way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>MOHR: Well, unfortunately it did, in a negative way. I didn't want to have
                    anything to do with it afterwards. I was especially irked by the fact that, in
                    orthodox Hebrew instruction, the student is not entitled to ask any questions
                    until after his bar-mitzvah, at age 13. So all during elementary school,
                    whenever I tried to ask a question, the teacher would explain that I had no
                    right to ask the question! I naturally thought this was doctrinaire and
                    ridiculous. Additionally, after all the long hours at school and doing homework
                    during the week, I wanted to play on the weekend, especially sports. However, it
                    was forbidden to play sports on Saturday, since this was the Jewish Sabbath.
                    When I did play, I was usually reported and then reprimanded on Monday at
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about growing up at a time when Israel was coming
                        forth but at the same time a lot of ultra-orthodox Jews gave Israel the cold
                        eye?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: My family was supportive of Israel. Ironically, they were definitely not
                    supportive of the State Department. They thought the State Department's Middle
                    East experts were pro-Arab and anti-Jewish, and they warned me never to join the
                    State Department. My compromise was to join the State Department, but to work on
                    U.S.-China foreign policy, rather than on the Arab-Israeli question.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well there are a lot of similarities between Jews and

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: True, both cultures emphasize family and food, as well as the value of an
                    education. I could parachute tomorrow into downtown Beijing and feel very
                    comfortable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's move on. How old were you when you left
                        elementary school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I was 10 when my father died, in 1955. I left yeshiva after sixth grade,
                    and then entered public junior high school. It was called Seth Low junior high,
                    named after a former mayor of New York City.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I liked it a lot, but the problem was that my mother was dying of breast
                    cancer, so when she was really sick, I had to move to my sister's home in New
                    Jersey. When she felt better, I moved back to Brooklyn. I did this at least
                    twice. Then, after I finished 9th grade in Brooklyn, she finally passed, and I
                    spent the last three years of high school in Elizabeth, New Jersey with my
                    sister and her family.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Thomas Jefferson High School in Elizabeth, New Jersey. It was a boys' high
                    school. In Elizabeth at the time, there was one all-boys high school, one
                    all-girls high school, and a co-ed vocational school. I have no idea why, but
                    that's the way it was. So I spent all three of my high school years in an
                    all-boys institution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Lonely. One of the reasons was that I was younger than everyone else. In
                    the tenth grade, I was 14. I graduated high school when I was 16. There were two
                    reasons for this. First, I started school a bit early. Secondly, I essentially
                    skipped eighth grade at Seth Low junior high school when I was in Brooklyn.
                    Actually, I did so with my whole class. In those days in New York City, children
                    were tested at the end of sixth grade. If you scored several years ahead in
                    reading and math, you were placed in what was called a Special Progress (or
                    S.P.) class. You and your classmates in junior high school stayed together as a
                    class, but in the first year you were in 7 S.P., and the next year you were in 9
                    S.P. So, again I essentially skipped eighth grade. Fortunately, I had a best
                    friend in high school, Howard Goldsweig. He went to private school, so we
                    weren't classmates. But he lived across the street, and we spent almost every
                    weekend together. He was even more shy than I was, so we never went out with
                    girls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't they have mixers and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Not that I remember. So when it got time to think about college, my main
                    criterion was that it be coeducational.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went to an all male prep school and an all male college,
                        and then spent four years in what was those days an essentially all male air
                        force as an enlisted man. So the first co-ed school I went to was graduate
                        school. I had always liked girls and so I sat next to the prettiest girl in
                        class and 54 years later we still fit. We are still together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Wonderful, but rare. So I was really lonely in high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you got to high school were you able to get
                        into New York or enjoy the movies or get around or do things.</hi>

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>MOHR: My sister sent me to this coeducational summer camp, so I met people there,
                    including girls. I also met this fellow Alexander Berzin, from Paterson, New
                    Jersey, and we became lifelong friends. During high school, we would meet on the
                    average of one Sunday a month in New York City, and spend time hanging around
                    Greenwich Village, going to the folk song cafes, etc. Later, we were roommates
                    in graduate school. Alex is now a Tibetan Buddhist monk and scholar. He has
                    written five books on Tibetan Buddhism, and after living for 30 years in
                    Dharamsala, India, he now lives in Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything like books or music that attracted
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Well, I really liked rock and roll music, but as I said, books did not
                    attract me particularly. At the time, although I was good in most subjects at
                    school (except physics), I was really scared because I had no idea what I wanted
                    to do, and didn't have a clue about a possible major in college. My brother was
                    a psychologist, so I told people I wanted to be a psychiatrist, because that
                    seemed to sound good. So when I went to college, at the University of Rochester,
                    I put down psychology as my major. Then in my second year, I took statistical
                    psychology, and really hated it. There were all these different tests for
                    everything, and it seemed like you could choose the test to fit the data.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: This struck me as wrong, if not downright immoral. So by the end of my
                    sophomore year, I had no major, no interest in anything specific. I didn't know
                    what I wanted to do. So then I thought well, I always wanted to live in Paris.
                    So I went to the French department and told them I wanted to spend my junior
                    year abroad in Paris. I needed their permission to go to Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the University of Rochester like other than
                        cold?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Exactly. In my senior year, the student body voted overwhelmingly to move
                    the campus to Miami. We used to say there were two seasons: winter and the 4th
                    of July. One time, after spring break, I took a bus back to school and when I
                    got close to campus, it started snowing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your plan to go to Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MOHR: What I had not realized was that the French department had not had a male
                    majoring in French for more than a decade. So when I walked in, they were quite
                    happy. However, they insisted that in order to receive their permission to go to
                    Paris, I had to declare French as my major, and graduate as a French major. It
                    seemed like a good deal, so I signed. It turned out well. I liked Paris a lot. I
                    didn't study much, but I learned French by osmosis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to the start of your college years, had the
                        outside world intruded at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Not really. I vaguely recall as a little boy being worried that my brother
                    would be drafted into the Korean War, but he wasn't. I believe it was because of
                    poor eyesight. My first “outside” world recollection growing up was Queen
                    Elizabeth's coronation in 1952.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Nixon-Kennedy election hit you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: That was when, 1960? Not a lot. I would say the first thing that really hit
                    me was the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Basically, I thought I was going to die
                    and I didn't think that was fair, as I was only a sophomore in college and
                    hadn't had much of a life to that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Paris, were you with a group from Rochester?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: No, I was by myself. The French department wasn't exactly a thriving
                    concern, so I was by myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A friend of mine who just recently died, Bill Morgan, was
                        graduated much earlier than you from Rochester. He ended up as consul
                        general in Paris and Montreal. He went to the Sorbonne actually.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Well, I will tell you that when I left Paris, my French pronunciation was
                    very good. I actually took a class in phonetics, and practiced a lot. Perhaps
                    this was because while I was at college in Rochester, I was made aware that I
                    had a Brooklyn accent, so I was determined to speak French properly, without an
                    accent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then while you were in France, other than the
                        language, what were you getting out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>MOHR: First a Norwegian girl friend, and when she left, a Swedish girl friend. I
                    was very popular with the Scandinavians. Parisians are not going to talk to you
                    unless you speak French really well. I lived in an apartment on the Left Bank
                    with two other American guys, so initially all we could do was hang around the
                    international community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there 1962-63?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: 1963-64. That academic year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a feel for the times, how did the
                        assassination of President Kennedy hit you? Do you recall that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Oh, yes. It hit me hard. For the first (and only) time, French people would
                    stop you in the street, ask if you were American, and then offer their
                    condolences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you came back from France...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, and I came back with the knowledge that I was really good at learning
                    foreign languages. At Rochester, when I first took French, I didn't excel, and I
                    thought I had no special gift for languages. In high school, I took four years
                    of French, but it was with a spinster Irish-American woman, and she seemed to
                    enjoy failing students more than seeing students learn. In any case, there was
                    no speaking, so I thought I couldn't do it. But after Paris, I wanted to learn
                    more languages. I knew English, Hebrew, and now French. I decided that I would
                    go onto graduate school and study comparative literature, and also decided it
                    would be fun to add an Asian language. Since I grew up in New York City and was
                    fascinated by Chinatown, I enrolled in an intensive Chinese language course at
                    Harvard the summer I returned from Paris. It was really hard, but I felt
                    positive and challenged. So in my senior year at Rochester, I took all these
                    French courses, so I could get credit for Paris and graduate on time, and I also
                    took a Chinese language course. Because of the Sputnik crisis, there was
                    fellowship money to study Chinese, and I was accepted to almost every place I
                    applied: Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Stanford and Berkeley. Ironically, I had one
                    rejection, the University of Hawaii. I never understood that. In any case, I
                    chose Harvard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you graduated from the University of Rochester in 1965.
                        Then you went to Harvard in Chinese studies. You were there for how
                        long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I went there for two years, for a master's degree in modern Chinese
                    history.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Really difficult. It was an unusual situation. For the first time, I
                    really, really enjoyed what I was studying. But I hated the place where I was
                    studying. I really hated it. At Harvard, they would take about 20 people in the
                    master's program, and then they would try to pressure you as much as possible to
                    see if you were “tough” enough to take it: they wanted just a few people for the
                    doctoral program. So there was no encouragement, no kind words. I didn't
                    function well in that kind of environment. It got so bad that by my second year,
                    I was so nervous that I couldn't eat solid food. I survived on instant
                    breakfasts until I realized I needed to leave. Then I did a paper on the China
                    experts in the foreign service, the “Old China Hands” as they were called, the
                    ones who got in all that trouble during the McCarthy era for predicting that Mao
                    Zedong and the communists would triumph over our ally, Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it sounds like you were going through the Jewish
                        education and all; you were a built-in sufferer weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Not to that degree. The pressure at Harvard was really too much for me. I
                    had a friend from Rochester who was in Chinese studies at Berkeley, and they
                    were encouraging him to stay, treating him like he was special, asking him about
                    his feelings. At Harvard, no one cared about your feelings. I knew from writing
                    to my friend at Berkeley that I had chosen the wrong school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Reading about the China Hands and all....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: It was for a seminar paper at the beginning of my second year at Harvard.
                    After doing the paper, it all clicked. I knew I wasn't fit for the doctoral
                    program. In addition to not liking all the pressure, I really didn't like
                    sitting in a library for eight to ten hours a day doing research. I wanted to do
                    something, to have a career and have the academics interview me and write about
                    me. So in doing the paper on the China experts in the foreign service, I decided
                    I wanted to be like them and join the foreign service, except obviously to try
                    and avoid being persecuted like they were during the McCarthy period. And it
                    turned out well. I really liked being a foreign service officer. I got to be a
                    China hand for my generation, to work for a few decades on building a
                    relationship between the United States and China. It was really rewarding work,
                    because we really did achieve something. When I was growing up, it was against
                    the law to even talk to someone from the Chinese mainland. Now there are
                    thousands of contacts, and so much more understanding. I helped contribute to
                    that. I really feel a sense of pride and accomplishment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You need to explain because people are going to be reading
                        this and we know but could you explain what the China Hands and the old
                        China hands were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Before World War II (WWII) we had consulates in every province in China.
                    The embassy was in Nanking, which was Chiang Kai-shek's capital. We had a
                    consulate-general in Beijing, which was then known as Peking. So the pattern for
                    many American experts on China was as follows. You would be born of missionary
                    parents in China, attend school there through high school and go to college in
                    the U.S. After graduation, you would join the foreign service and then return to
                    China. You could spend your whole career in China, since there were over two
                    dozen posts. Of course, that's one of the reasons why the Old China Hands were
                    criticized so much during the McCarthy era. They were accused on not being
                    “American” enough, because of their rather unique backgrounds.</p>
                <p>In my opinion, these China experts were just doing their jobs. They reported
                    accurately on the Chinese civil war between the communists and our allies. They
                    analyzed the situation and concluded that since Mao had the support of the
                    peasants, who made up well over 95 percent of the population, and Chiang had the
                    support of business circles and industrialists, who made up a small fraction of
                    the population, that Mao would win. For these predictions, they were persecuted
                    by McCarthy and fellow witch-hunters. They were accused of pro-communist and
                    anti-American sympathies, and even of lending support to the communist enemy. It
                    didn't help that once Mao and the communists won, they kicked out the
                    missionaries, so the entire U.S. Christian church community joined the hunt to
                    find out “Who lost China?” (That is to say, looking for scapegoats regarding who
                    was responsible for China becoming communist and thereby being “lost” to the
                    U.S. as a friendly nation.) Almost all the Chinese language officers in the
                    foreign service lost their jobs, having had their security clearances taken away
                    from them. I would note here that their employers, the Department of State, did
                    little to defend them. When I joined the foreign service in 1969, I was very
                    surprised because there were very few senior China specialists. I should not
                    have been surprised. Between 1952 and 1969 very few people wanted to go into the
                    China field because it was, to say the least, not career enhancing.</p>

                <p>MOHR: Well you could go to Taiwan, and I believe, Hong Kong.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You go to Taiwan or Hong Kong. Then they would have people
                        in other places in Asia too, the China watchers, but looking at people
                        interested in it later when they see this transcript, there is a long oral
                        history which is done at the University of California at Berkeley by John
                        Stuart Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>MOHR: That is correct. I met Mr. Service in 1969. On the way back home from Peace
                    Corps Korea, I stopped off in Berkeley because my best friend from Rochester was
                    doing graduate work there. Since I was in Berkeley, I sought out Service, and
                    met with him. He informed me that his son was in the foreign service, but his
                    son's languages were Spanish and Portuguese. He said that was a hint.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is really an excellent oral history. I highly recommend
                        it to anybody to get a feel for it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: OK. Afterward, please show me how to access it. I have one additional point
                    I would like to make. I think there needs to be a serious study on how having no
                    one really in the U.S. government who knew anything about China negatively
                    impacted our assumptions at the time of the Vietnam War. Our national leaders
                    thought China was behind North Vietnam's aggression, that it was all a communist
                    plot—just as the Soviet Union wanted to control all of Europe, so China wanted
                    hegemony over Asia. Ho Chi Minh was Mao's younger brother, so to speak, and he
                    was taking orders from Mao. The fact that it was basically a Vietnamese civil
                    war didn't seem to enter anyone's mind, nor did anyone seem to know that over
                    the past millennium China and Vietnam had fought 58 major wars. The basic
                    feeling between the two countries was enmity, despite their both having
                    communist governments. Vietnam, being much smaller, certainly never really
                    trusted China. I believe the fact that there were no China experts in the State
                    Department to argue forcefully against the “common knowledge” at the time was an
                    incredibly important factor in getting us so deeply into the mess of the Vietnam
                    War. I will never forget in 2004 I attended an international conference in
                    Hanoi. I sat by a senior Vietnamese foreign ministry official, and for three
                    days, during the breaks, he constantly harangued me as follows: “Why do you pay
                    so much attention to China? We Vietnamese are important. You should pay more
                    attention to us, and less to China. We want more trade with you. You don't
                    listen to us. You ignore us. We want more trade with you.” Such an attitude was
                    perfectly foreseeable if anybody had had half a brain in 1965. But we were still
                    traumatized by the rise of Soviet communism at the end of WWII, and the trauma
                    increased with the “loss” of China to the communists in 1949. One effect was the
                    loss of a great deal of China expertise within the U.S. government for a
                    generation, and it is my contention that the loss led directly to the ignorance
                    and ignorant assumptions that lay at the core of our Vietnam policy and the
                    Vietnam War.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get your master's degree from Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1967?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>MOHR: Right. But by the time I received my master's degree, I had already passed
                    the foreign service exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took the written exam. How about the oral exam. Any
                        questions on how it went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Well, as they say, it's better to be lucky than good. I took the foreign
                    service exam either at the end of 1966 or the beginning of 1967. In any event,
                    the Cultural Revolution was raging in China, and many in the U.S. were extremely
                    interested in what was going on in China. I felt that my examiners, instead of
                    grilling me, were just happy to ask me questions about what was going on in
                    China, and let me answer them. I was quite practiced in doing so, because
                    Harvard had a speaker's program and we graduate students would speak about China
                    in Boston and other venues throughout the state. Apparently, I impressed the
                    examiners sufficiently to pass. I assume they made the judgment that the foreign
                    service needed more people who were knowledgeable about China. So I was lucky,
                    because a few years earlier they would not have made such a determination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are so off the subject but how about the Vietnam War?
                        How did the Vietnam War stand with you draft wise or your feeling about the
                        war at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Since I felt we were in Vietnam for all the wrong reasons, I did not want
                    to go to Vietnam. Graduate school offered me the opportunity for a deferment, as
                    did the Peace Corps. Once I joined the foreign service, I was safe again from
                    being drafted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk about the Peace Corps then. You started in
                        '67?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Right, 1967 to 1969. I applied for the Peace Corps while still in graduate
                    school, at the same time I applied to the foreign service. I felt that I first
                    wanted to learn about Asia from the ground up, so to speak, and that going into
                    the Peace Corps would be excellent training for the foreign service. Since it
                    was impossible to go to China at the time, I applied for South Korea, as the
                    nearest country available with a Confucian culture, and was accepted. I was a
                    member of the third group to go out to Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get in? How did they train you? How did you
                        sign up for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MOHR: Well, when I filled in the application, they asked for your preferences.
                    During our three-month training period, I found out that among the 120 trainees
                    there, only three had asked for Korea. Apparently, most wanted to go to Latin
                    America, especially Brazil. So those of us who had asked for Korea were pretty
                    much assured of going there. During the training, approximately one-third were
                    “selected out,” and did not get the opportunity to go. Unfortunately, not all
                    those selected out were eliminated for the right reason. Incredibly, in 1967,
                    despite the U.S. having spent more than three years fighting the Korean War in
                    the early 1950s, almost no one knew anything about Korean culture. Proof of this
                    was that our main book in training, selected as the core for our cultural
                    studies about Korea, was Ruth Benedict's The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, which
                    is about Japan!</p>
                <p>Apparently, the assumption was that Japanese and Koreans were basically the same.
                    Thus, many people were selected out of training because they were too loud or
                    too aggressive. Perhaps they would not have fit into Japanese society, but they
                    certainly would have fit in well in Korean society. They were never given the
                    opportunity. Most of the quiet, sensitive types were allowed to go to Korea, and
                    many of them only lasted a few months, because Koreans happen to be more to the
                    opposite of those quiet and sensitive type personality traits. When I arrived in
                    Korea, I tried to reign in my personality because I had been told in training
                    Koreans were quiet and passive. I taught English at a middle school in Korea,
                    and the first night out with my teachers, they were shouting, singing, making a
                    lot of noise, banging on their rice bowls with their chopsticks, and
                    aggressively flirting with the waitresses. I knew then, over the course of the
                    evening, that our whole training program was wrong. They trained us for the
                    wrong country. Whoops!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am no cultural expert but I was in Korea in the Air
                        Force as an enlisted man. The thing I liked about the Koreans was we ate
                        with the Korean Air Force. We were all together and if you shoved in the
                        chow line they shoved back. It was great; some people call them the Irish of
                        the Far East.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: So true. The Koreans are up front. They are frank and they are honest. Now
                    some people may not like that, but I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I found it refreshing. Again as an enlisted man in
                        Japan I was always hankering for Korea. I was there you might say in the
                        worst of times because the war was on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: You were there during the Korean War?</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: So where were you based?</p>

                        where that is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Weren't you glad you weren't in the infantry?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Chonu was up off Yung Yung Poo, It was during the war
                        we held those islands, so it was up in the Yellow Sea off North Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Really?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, we were in, we had a British cruiser in the channel
                        there. But as I said thousands of Americans had gone to Korea during the
                        war. I mean if Stu Kennedy could come out with this impression, what the
                        hell....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: One of the many things wrong with the training program—only this time
                    through no fault of Peace Corps administration— was that at the time no
                    volunteers had yet completed their two-year tours of duty. When they did, some
                    went into training, and of course one of the first things they did was to hammer
                    home the fact that Korea was quite different from Japan. The drop-out rate
                    started to decline.</p>

                    but I wasn't going anywhere close to the demilitarized zone. If there was going
                    to be another invasion, I wanted to make sure I could make a safe getaway.</p>

                <p>MOHR: Well it was a big city, as opposed to most of the villages where the
                    majority of Peace Corps volunteers were based. Coming from New York City, I
                    wanted to be in a city. Also, the allies had stopped the North Korean invasion
                    in 1950 just north of Taegu, so the city had not been destroyed during the
                    Korean War. But it was still very poor at the time. Most people did not have
                    indoor plumbing. Taegu at the time I was there was a dusty, dirty city of about
                    one million people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you taught English?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Just English, yes. During the first year, I taught at a middle school,
                    first year English. But English is a hard language for Koreans to learn, because
                    it is so different from their language. So in a year, if you can teach them to
                    respond to “Are you a boy?” by saying “Yes, I am,” rather than “Yes, she does,”
                    you're making progress. I did not want to go through this for a second year,
                    however, so I asked to be transferred to a university, where I could actually
                    talk to my students in English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the university students were more
                        responsive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, the students could speak some English.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The classes tend to be very big.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, in middle school anyway. I mean there were 20-30 in university, but in
                    middle school there were 60 in a class. It was a challenge to try to teach 60 in
                    a class. One interesting thing is that Koreans, like most Asians, are used to
                    being in a crowded society, so they have learned not to take up much space. You
                    could only fit about 30 Americans into the class size occupied by 60
                    Koreans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find them as students in the middle
                        school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: They were energetic and hard working students. But it was frustrating
                    because their progress was so slow. Now they begin English in the third grade,
                    not in seventh grade, so by the time they are in junior high school, they have a
                    working knowledge of English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well were you accepted by the faculty at the
                        school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I think most of the English teachers felt I was a threat, because I was a
                    native speaker. But I had a co-teacher Mr. Lee Sang-mu, who was one of the
                    finest human beings I have ever met. He was kind and understanding, and I don't
                    know if I could have survived Korea without him. He loved the English language,
                    and had a book containing Churchill's speeches, which he kept next to him on his
                    desk. After I had been in Korea a few weeks, I noticed his eyes were moist. I
                    asked him if he was upset. He replied, on the contrary, that he was very happy.
                    He told me that it was his fondest desire to improve his English, but he never
                    dreamed that he would be able to have an American sitting next to him for two
                    years, so that whenever he had a question about English, he could just ask. We
                    lost contact for many years, but about 12 years ago we got in touch again, and
                    we have continued to write letters to each other. He is 85 and doesn't like
                    e-mail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you make progress in Korean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Oh yes, although it took almost a year until I was comfortable. We only had
                    12 weeks of language training, and Korean is a very different language from
                    English. So that added to the strains of the first year. In addition to the new
                    surroundings and the food, you couldn't communicate much to people beside basic
                    baby talk. You felt like a complete idiot, and most Koreans you met had never
                    met anyone who couldn't speak Korean, so they were a bit puzzled as to why you
                    couldn't communicate with them. You were always wondering if they thought you
                    were a bit retarded.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you ever in contact with the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Once or twice, because when I was in Peace Corps, I had already passed the
                    foreign service exam, so I was curious what life in the foreign service was
                    like. I met some people at the Embassy in Seoul, and had lunch with one of them
                    and dinner with another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the administration direction of the Peace
                        Corps while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Quite good. Kevin O'Donnell was the head of Peace Corps Korea, and he later
                    became director of the entire Peace Corps. He was a very good director. Mel
                    Merkin was our regional director for southeast Korea. He was based in Taegu, and
                    easy to talk to. He was a very kind fellow. He was a lawyer who decided he
                    didn't like practicing law anymore. He wanted to do something different. So we
                    had adult supervision and it was pretty good, pretty caring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you come away form the Peace Corps with a positive
                        view about the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Most definitely. I mean, the thing that bothered me the most had been our
                    training, but that was corrected. A lot of the people from my group, K-III (the
                    third group to go to Korea) went into training. I went into the foreign service,
                    but through the years and various Peace Corps reunions, I heard stories from
                    people in K-III about their various experiences training other Peace Corps
                    groups. As for having been in Korea, I was very grateful. It accomplished its
                    initial purpose: after surviving various parasitic infections and getting used
                    to an outside toilet in the winter time, the little administrative and housing
                    problems you incur in the foreign service did not seem so important. Also, I
                    really have a warm feeling for the Korean people, and a special feeling for my
                    co-teacher, Mr. Lee Sang-mu.</p>

                <p>MOHR: That's fine, we're at the point where I've just finished Peace Corps and am

                        Kennedy, and this is Mark Mohr. When did you come into the foreign
                        service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: It was the fall of 1969, I believe in October.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So let's talk a little bit about your foreign service
                        class, A-100.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: The A-100 class. I think there were 36 in the class. There was a
                    controversial element which I think was interesting, in that most of the people
                    entering the class received literature from the foreign service a few months
                    before they entered. I was actually in Korea when I received my letter, saying
                    there that there were slots available in Vietnam. (I remember the acronym for
                    the assignment, CORDS (civil operations and revolutionary development support),
                    but I don't remember what it stood for, but it was something to do with
                    assisting in local economic development in the countryside.) The letter said if
                    you volunteered for CORDS, you could join the foreign service immediately, but
                    if you didn't sign up for CORDS, there was no telling when slots would be
                    available, as hiring in the regular foreign service was very difficult at the
                    moment.</p>
                <p>I thought about it for a few days, and finally decided that I would not accept
                    the offer to go to Vietnam. For reasons I explained previously, I felt we were
                    in Vietnam for all the wrong reasons. Now, there were 36 people in our class
                    that October and it turned out over half of them were going to Vietnam in CORDS
                    because they had agreed to the offer. But the remainder of the class, including
                    myself, had declined the offer but had been accepted into the Foreign Service
                    anyway, at the same time as those who had volunteered for CORDS. So those going
                    to Vietnam were not happy about what they perceived as having been tricked, but
                    there was nothing they could do about it. As to the class itself, we were almost
                    all against the Vietnam War, and during weekends many would protest the war. We
                    would protest for awhile, then when we got cold, we would use the foreign
                    service lounge on the first floor in Main State to warm up, and then we would go
                    out and protest again. Overall, I enjoyed the six weeks of training.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in training , I was actually in Vietnam at

                <p>MOHR: Sorry.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Still there were an awful lot of U.S. troops in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much talk about the Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes there was. As I just stated, many in the class participated in
                    protests. I remember very sadly there was someone at the Foreign Service
                    Institute (FSI) who had been the Vietnamese desk officer at some point in the
                    late 1940s, I believe. I think his name was Paul Kattenberg. Anyway, he wrote a
                    big policy paper arguing we should not pick up France's imperial burden, and
                    should let Vietnam be independent. He was ignored, of course. Paul continued to
                    protest the Vietnam War in the 1960s, and as a reward for his efforts he was
                    permanently exiled to FSI. Somehow, Paul was allowed to address our A-100
                    course. I was fascinated, and had a private meeting with him. It was very
                    moving, very sad, and it was a good warning about what could happen to your
                    career if you strayed from political correctness. Kattenberg said that almost
                    everyone involved in Vietnam had been promoted, while most of those who
                    protested the policy had their careers derailed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I have interviewed him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: All right. So that was eye-opening. I made some friends in the A-100
                    course, and I enjoyed learning about the various parts of the U.S.
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So did you have any goal in mind on where you wanted to
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Of course. I wanted to be a “new” China hand. I wanted to get advanced
                    Chinese language training, and be a political officer in Hong Kong.
                    Unfortunately, when I was sworn into the foreign service, it was one of those
                    times of budget tightening. If you had passed your foreign language requirement,
                    you could not go overseas. I passed in Korean, so I was first assigned to the
                    operations center at State for a few months, and then to the Office of Southern
                    African Affairs (AF/S) for about a year and a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well had you ever thought about Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: No, and the big irony is that my son is an Africanist. He has a Ph.D. in
                    African anthropology and teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to
                    being assigned to AF/S, I had never thought about Africa, and had no particular
                    interest in it. It was an interesting time in 1969, though, to be on the
                    Southern Africa desk. There was a bit of controversy, especially about the Ian
                    Smith regime in Rhodesia, which I don't think we supported.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Never.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>MOHR: Right, OK. As the junior officer, one of my basic responsibilities was
                    answering the mail. We received countless letters in support for the white-only
                    apartheid regime in Rhodesia, demanding to know why the U.S. government was not
                    backing Ian Smith. Since in my opinion these letters bordered on the racist, my
                    initial replies were fairly confrontational. By the way, most of this “hate
                    mail” came from southern California and Florida., apparently from retirees who
                    had nothing better to do. I remember the deputy director counseling me,
                    explaining that the purpose of the reply was to smother the writer with such
                    blandness that he would get fed up with us and stop writing, not to incite him
                    to reply again. I was told to create boilerplate language and repeat such
                    language as much as possible. So this is what I did, but some of the letters
                    were really vicious. One, for example, suggested we should use nuclear weapons
                    on the black areas of South Africa and Rhodesia to teach them a lesson. What I
                    wanted to reply was something along the lines of how would you like it if we
                    machine-gunned your children. But I understood the point the deputy director was
                    making, and I got pretty good at creating a multitude of blandly correct
                    paragraphs, and then cutting and pasting as necessary.</p>

                        flak. The Polynesians were “mau mauing,” which was trying to scare the hell
                        out of him.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>MOHR: So anyway I spent my time basically doing the office correspondence. I also
                    was in charge of clearances throughout the building for policy papers. I would
                    take, for example, a dozen of these long papers in shopping baskets and wheel
                    them around the building, dropping them off in the various offices as required.
                    Then I would follow up on the phone and bug the offices for their clearances.
                    After about a year of this, with about six months to go on my assignment, I got
                    a call from my personnel officer. He said they had a job for me in Taiwan. I was
                    excited. I asked about the job, and he said it was to be the non-immigrant visa
                    officer. I had no idea what the job was really like, but I told him I had two
                    requirements. I wanted to be able to speak Chinese, and meet Chinese people. My
                    personnel officer chuckled, and said those two requirements would surely be met.
                    So I was very happy and thought the foreign service was the best. Of course I
                    had no clue that in my desire to be a China expert, I would be starting at the
                    very bottom, interviewing non-immigrant visa applicants.</p>
                <p>It was not all the foreign service's fault that the job turned out to be so bad.
                    Naturally, there was a lot of misrepresentation. People said they just wanted a
                    tourist visa to go to the States, and then on day one after arriving in the U.S.
                    would head over to the immigration and naturalization service (INS) and apply to
                    adjust status to be an immigrant, to stay in the U.S. You knew this because
                    every month copies of the INS application forms of people you had issued tourist
                    visas to would appear on your desk. They were particularly noticeable because
                    the INS adjustment of status forms were printed on blue paper. For the first
                    several months of my job, I interviewed between 30-40 applicants per day. This
                    wasn't too bad. However, in October 1971, Taiwan got kicked out of the United
                    Nations, as the People's Republic of China (PRC) was voted in. There was mild
                    panic in Taiwan. People thought that it would be best, just in case China
                    decided to invade, to have a tourist visa to the U.S. as insurance. So in a very
                    short period of time, visa applications jumped from about 40 per day to over 160
                    per day. They quadrupled. And I was the only visa officer. We were a
                    three-person office. Besides myself, there was the consul, a very kind-hearted
                    man, and a very nice woman who did American citizen services. Occasionally, the
                    consul, who spoke Chinese, would help out, but essentially I was on my own.
                    After trying to get help, State replied that I would be replaced by two people
                    when my tour ended, but because training took so long, I just had to hold the
                    fort in the interim. It was very stressful, so I was extremely happy to see my
                    tour end. I guess there is some benefit, when you're starting out your career,
                    to have your worst job at the beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the sort of, I mean I realize you were besieged
                        with your non-immigrants. What was the political situation in Taiwan in that
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Chang Kai-shek was president. It was a dictatorship, but it functioned
                    fairly smoothly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there still the tremendous tension between the
                        Kuomintang and the Taiwanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>MOHR: Oh yes, most definitely. But the Taiwanese were allowed a safety valve in
                    the business sphere. As long as they stuck to making money, they were fine. They
                    were not allowed into politics, or into the military at the officer level; that
                    was the purview of the mainlanders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern about the mainland Chinese invading. I
                        mean real concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, there was concern, but for those without means, there was not much
                    they could do. For those with means, it was time to get a U.S. visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What language where you speaking, Mandarin, Cantonese, or
                        Taiwanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I spoke Mandarin. I later figured out that trying to communicate in
                    Mandarin to the visa applicants was a bad idea, since they had the upper hand,
                    since their language ability was obviously better than mine. So when I could, I
                    used a translator, and then I could appear as the stony-faced higher official,
                    rather than the hesitating person trying to speak their language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of a pressure group in the United States
                        working on your visas, I mean Senators and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes. All the time, and it drove me crazy. For example, Taiwan had a law
                    that if a male was 16 years old he couldn't go overseas until completing his
                    required military service. So many 15 year-olds would apply to visit their
                    grandmothers whom they had never known. I would reject these applicants. Then
                    State would forward a letter from some Senator or Congressman, demanding to know
                    why I had rejected the fine brother of some person who, while housing the
                    grandmother, was probably not even a U.S. citizen. I wondered why the visa
                    office at State, who knew the regulation regarding military service in Taiwan,
                    would not answer the letter, but instead passed the buck to a junior
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about social life there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Let's see, I married someone I met in Peace Corps, just before entering the
                    foreign service. My first child, Jennifer, was born on Taiwan, so that kept us
                    busy. There was a large U.S. military presence, so you could use all their
                    facilities, such as movies and the post exchange. My wife also got a job helping
                    edit an English language magazine devoted to Chinese culture. Occasionally, we
                    would take trips around the island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were on Taiwan until what, 1971?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MOHR: From 1971 to 1973. Things looked up as my next assignment was advanced
                    language training in Taichung. That would get my ticket punched into the China
                    club.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is still in Taiwan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Right. Taipei is on the northern part of the island, and Taichung is toward
                    the center, on the western side. The school, which was run by the State
                    Department but was actually the advanced Chinese language school for the entire
                    U.S. government, was in Taichung at the time. After normalization with China,
                    the school moved to Taipei.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find this year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I loved it. I had a house with a double yard, and one yard had a volleyball
                    court. Every Saturday, I was host to my schoolmates, who came there to play
                    volleyball and let off some steam. During the week, studying was intense. We had
                    about five hours of class work and five hours of homework per day. The
                    volleyball was a great outlet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in 1974 you are off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, after completing language training, I was assigned as a junior
                    political officer in Hong Kong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in Taiwan were you getting much news of
                        what was going on in Indo China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Not really. In Taipei, I was just trying to survive the visa experience. In
                    Taichung, I was studying all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Hong Kong when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: In the summer of 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>MOHR: For three years, from 1974-1977. I helped report on the death of Chinese
                    Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman Mao's death, the end of the cultural revolution,
                    etc. I just loved the job. We read four to six Chinese newspapers a day, from
                    the mainland and Hong Kong, read translated transcripts of provincial Chinese
                    radio broadcasts, and talked to fellow China-watchers at other consulates and
                    from the media. As we had only a small liaison office in Beijing, consulate Hong
                    Kong produced a sort of Time Magazine weekly review of events in China. For some
                    unknown reason, it was called the Weeka, and we went to press every Wednesday.
                    We got it out before lunchtime, and then the political section would usually go
                    to our favorite Italian restaurant in Hong Kong for pizza. At last, I was a real
                    China-watcher, and I loved it. I could talk about Chinese politics all day
                    long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take your classic Chinese watcher. What were you
                        watching and how do you do it, or did you do it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: You read. You read the newspapers; you read the transcripts of the radio
                    broadcasts, and you figured out, or you tried to figure out, what was going on
                    with the leadership, who was in and who was out, what were the policies they
                    were trying to pursue in the provinces, what were their economic policies, and
                    of course what were their attitudes toward the U.S. It was all very analytical,
                    and there was a lot of guess work, but for someone who up to that point had
                    never had a “real” political job at an embassy, it was great fun. I was doing
                    internal Chinese politics, so in my last year in Hong Kong, I switched to
                    Chinese foreign policy so I could work on issues a little bit closer to more
                    classic foreign service work, which centered on foreign policy issues and
                    particularly the host country's attitude toward the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With regard to internal politics, had you had much
                        experience in America following politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: No, not really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Hong Kong, were you able to tap into the people who
                        were coming out of China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: The refugees?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>

                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>MOHR: The British systematically interviewed them, and gave us copies of the
                    interviews. But China was an elite communist political regime, and the refugees
                    for the most part were in the same boat so to speak as we were: they had to
                    guess at what was really going on. So the refugee debriefings were not all that
                    useful, but they were interesting nonetheless. I recall that one woman refugee
                    from Anhwei province, when asked in 1976 about the influence of the Cultural
                    Revolution o her village replied, “What's the Cultural Revolution?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in Hong Kong were there people, like those on Taiwan,
                        who were trying to prepare to leave if they had to. Was that going on in
                        Hong Kong too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: No. This was the mid-1970s, and Hong Kong was a British colony. The people
                    of Hong Kong, although they didn't like the British, felt safe enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for a change in U.S. policy toward
                        China, with the beginning of the Carter administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Carter won the election in 1976. By that time, my tour was winding down,
                    and in any case, I don't think we were privy to any sensitive negotiations of
                    the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean we had opened up with China. Did that play any role

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Not much, because even though the U.S. liaison office (USLO) had opened, it
                    was quite small. At the time, there was only a two-person political section, and
                    its time was taken up mostly in the care and escort of visitors, so Hong Kong
                    remained the basic political reporting base for events in China. The Weeka
                    continued. It was a little strange. The post hundreds of miles from the capital
                    of China did the basic political reporting, and the post inside China did
                    not.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well was the Gang of Four over doing its bit? What was

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Mao died in September, 1976, and the Gang of Four, including Mao's wife,
                    was arrested within one month of Mao's death. As a matter of fact, I entered
                    China on the day the Gang of Four was arrested. Each of us in the political
                    section was allowed one trip to visit our colleagues in USLO during our tour,
                    and mine was scheduled for the fall of 1976. It was an interesting time to
                    visit. There were wall-posters in all the cities celebrating the arrest of the
                    Gang of Four. I traveled to Beijing from Hong Kong with my wife on the train. We
                    stopped off for a day or two in Guangzhou (Canton), and then went directly to
                    Beijing.</p>

                        how China might go after the death of Mao?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Mao was initially replaced by Hua Guofeng, but he didn't last very long,
                    and then Deng Xiaoping took over. Deng was certainly more pragmatic than Mao,
                    and he knew how to develop and grow an economy. There was a misperception in the
                    West that because we could understand (and approved of) his economic policies,
                    that he was a moderate. This was incorrect. Politically, Deng believed in the
                    dictatorship of the proletariat, led by the communist party. He was not a cute,
                    cuddly little guy. He was a communist dictator. In the 1960s, there was a
                    down-to-the-countryside movement when millions of college students were sent to
                    the villages to “learn from the peasants.” Their academic lives were destroyed.
                    Deng, not Mao, was behind the movement. Unlike Mao, however, Deng did believe
                    that pragmatic economic development was important, so long as the Communist
                    party maintained control.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel of the central government and its
                        rule, sort of the cadres running equivalent to the counties or not? Did the

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: No, in Hong Kong we really didn't get a feel for how policies played out at
                    the local level. We were mainly studying the central leadership. It was a bit
                    odd. We were living in this British colony, and we were the supposed experts on
                    what was going on in China, even though there was a small U.S. liaison office in
                    Beijing. We were the experts, but it was an academic kind of expertise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that everything was in the hands of
                        academics? You know academics have a tendency, a very strong tendency, to
                        have firm ideas and often diverse ideas from each other. Was this sort of
                        academic warfare sort of playing itself out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>MOHR: We weren't academics. Within the U.S. government (USG) in Washington, there
                    were at times fierce disagreements on what was going on in China. Especially as
                    the Sino-Soviet split built up, many within the USG failed to see this coming.
                    Also, in the years leading up to the Cultural Revolution, only a very few
                    analysts believed Mao was not in full control of China. But in the political
                    section in Hong Kong, while I was there, there were no such disagreements. For
                    example, there was a political campaign in China starting in about 1973 that
                    began as the anti-Lin Biao campaign. Let me explain here that Lin Biao was a
                    very famous Chinese general, hand-picked by Mao to replace him. Lin reportedly
                    betrayed Mao, was discovered, and was fleeing China to the Soviet Union, when
                    his plane crashed and he died. Anyway, this anti-Lin Biao campaign soon morphed
                    into an anti-Lin Biao, anti-Confucius campaign. We in Hong Kong reported that
                    the anti-Lin Biao campaign had been an attempt by the conservatives within the
                    Chinese government and party to attack the radicals, led by the Gang of Four.
                    The Gang of Four tried to turn the tables, and began their own anti-Confucius
                    campaign, with Confucius being the fairly obvious stand-in for then Premier Zhou
                    Enlai. So it was a real battle, played out with a war of words daily in the
                    media, between the Gang of Four's faction and Zhou En-lai's faction.</p>
                <p>Ironically, Henry Kissinger, who then I believe was head of the National Security
                    Council (NSC), was concerned that Zhou might be in political trouble, so he
                    actually contacted Zhou and asked him. Of course Zhou replied that he wasn't
                    being attacked, so Kissinger decided that our reporting to the contrary was all
                    wrong. It didn't occur to Kissinger that Zhou was not admitting the truth. By
                    this time, it was 1975. As Zhou Enlai remained in power, Kissinger and his
                    people felt vindicated that our reporting was seriously misguided. As a matter
                    of fact, one of Kissinger's senior aides in the State Department received a
                    “courageous” reporting award for writing memos to him that Hong Kong's reporting
                    was wrong and Zhou Enlai was not in any political trouble. It was only after
                    Zhou died in early 1976, and following the purge of the Gang of Four that fall,
                    that the Chinese media let loose with a torrent of reporting stating the evil
                    Gang of Four and its followers had continuously attacked “beloved” leader Zhou
                    Enlai during the anti-Confucius campaign. So history proved us right, but it was
                    too late for us to receive any awards. At the time, all we received was
                    criticism. But fortunately, there was no Senator McCarthy around, so no one
                    really suffered. All that happened was that we didn't get promoted.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Another interesting reporting “moment,” I believe this was in 1975, occurred when
                    the West German prime minister visited China. In a meeting with Mao Zedong, it
                    was reported in the Chinese media that Mao said, when talking about Deng
                    Xiaoping, that Deng “didn't listen to him anymore.” Now I recalled that when
                    Deng Xiaoping had been purged during the Cultural Revolution, Chinese documents
                    had claimed that one of the reasons for Deng's purge had been that he was
                    arrogant, and didn't listen to Mao anymore. I thought that Mao telling a
                    foreigner that Deng wasn't listening to him was very significant. So I wrote up
                    a report stating that this indicated Deng was in political trouble. The problem
                    was that there was no previous indication that Deng was in any political trouble
                    whatsoever. So the political counselor, Don Anderson, who was my boss, said he
                    did not want to send the cable. I rewrote it, and made it much more conditional.
                    I said although this was merely a straw in the wind, it might be important, and
                    we were reporting it so that the Washington China community might factor this
                    one tidbit into its analysis. As I was about to depart for home leave, Don said
                    the cable looked OK and he would send it.</p>
                <p>When I returned from home leave, I was surprised to learn that Don did not send
                    the cable. He said upon reflection, it was just too “iffy,” and did not merit a
                    report. A few months later, Deng Xiaoping was purged, and all the China-watchers
                    in the Washington community came under severe criticism. There was even a study,
                    launched I believe by the CIA, to find out why nobody ever reported that Deng
                    Xiaoping was in trouble. Another possible moment of glory, and it passed me
                    by.</p>

                <p>MOHR: China was trying to use its influence to win support in the Third World,
                    and not having a lot of money, I think they felt a little foreign aid could go a
                    long way in Africa. They funded some major projects, such as the Tan-Zam
                    railroad. They were also trying to compete with the Soviets. But because of the
                    approximately 10 years of the Cultural Revolution, 1966-1976, where they were
                    almost totally focused on internal problems, their foreign policy and influence
                    abroad was fairly limited.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, we were. There were only a few serious China watching posts among the
                    consulates in Hong Kong. Of course, the British has great resources, and the
                    Japanese put a lot of effort into China watching. Other than those two
                    countries, other diplomatic posts were not serious China watchers, and drew much
                    of their information from us. I was surprised that the Europeans, particularly
                    the French and the Germans, just did not seem very interested in what was going
                    on in China.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anybody looking at the Chinese influence in other

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: In our political section, we had one Vietnamese language officer, to
                    monitor Vietnamese influence in southeast Asia. Also, since we graduated more
                    Chinese languages officers from school than there were postings, there were
                    slots in various political sections in Indonesia and Malaysia for Chinese
                    language officers to follow China's influence there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think you are right. I have talked to people who
                        were in Burma and Malaysia. Of course we had one who was doing something in
                        Warsaw. But that was as a translator.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Right. But in Hong Kong, in our political section, we had about a dozen
                    people, and one slot designated for a Vietnamese language officer. When I was
                    there, it was a fellow named Charlie Lahiguera. He had a very interesting
                    background. His father had been a Spanish diplomat, who, in 1937, closed the
                    Spanish embassy in Washington when Franco took over, and then asked for, and
                    received, political asylum. So young Charlie then became an American citizen. We
                    liked Charlie a lot, but our work rarely intersected, and he knew very little
                    about China.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well had the Chinese Sino-Vietnamese war taken place while

                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>MOHR: No, that took place in 1979, and by then I had left Hong Kong and had been
                    assigned to Embassy Tokyo. The Sino-Vietnamese war was a brief affair, lasting
                    only a few weeks. In the great words of Chinese propaganda, it was described as
                    a “counter-attack in self-defense,” and their attack was necessary to “teach
                    Vietnam a lesson.” Vietnam had just concluded a mutual defense treaty with the
                    Soviet Union, and the Chinese were incensed. They felt Vietnam was complicit in
                    a Soviet attempt to surround them by hostile forces. In any event, by all U.S.
                    military analysis, the battle-hardened Vietnamese roughed up the Chinese forces
                    pretty badly, and the Chinese had to retreat. Publicly, of course, the Chinese
                    claimed a great victory.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I was there from the summer of 1977 to the summer of 1980. So I spent three
                    years in Taiwan, two years as a vice consul and one as a language student, three
                    years in Hong Kong as a junior political officer, and three years in Tokyo as a
                    somewhat less junior political officer. I missed the 1970s in the U.S. I was
                    overseas.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, so we are now in 1977.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Former Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield. This was the first three
                    years in what turned out to be a 12-year tour for Ambassador Mansfield. He was
                    first appointed by President Carter, and then reappointed by President Reagan.
                    So I was there in the early Mansfield years. I was lucky, because Mansfield was
                    greatly interested in China, and I was the only China specialist at the
                    Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he had been a marine in China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Correct, guarding the Beijing-Tianjin railroad in the early 1920s. I think
                    Mansfield was a bit disappointed initially that he didn't get the Beijing job,
                    but after a while you could tell that he realized how important Japan was to the
                    United States, and he grew to really love his job in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah well it was a far more important job at that
                        particular time.</hi>

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>MOHR: Oh yes, and he understood that. He coined a memorable phrase, “The most
                    important U.S. bilateral relationship—bar none.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you were the China watcher.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Correct. I was the China watcher. There were approximately 12 people in the
                    political section. 11 were fluent in Japanese, and then there was me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, so what did you feel like? You were in the
                        Chrysanthemum club, the club for Japanese specialists, but you were a China
                        hand. Did you feel like a fish out of water?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Well, I wasn't in the Chrysanthemum club, composed of Japanese language
                    officers. I was more like an observer. But I soon grew to be interested in Japan
                    and Japanese society. So I asked my colleagues a lot of questions, and as is
                    normal with human nature, when they realized I was interested in what they were
                    doing, they grew to accept me as a sort of honorary member of the Chrysanthemum
                    club. About halfway through the tour, the deputy chief of mission called me into
                    his office and offered me the opportunity of Japanese language training. It was
                    a great honor, but after thinking it over for several days, I declined. I
                    thought that if I learned Japanese, when I was in China, I would feel guilty and
                    anxious because I wasn't doing enough to keep up my Japanese, and when I was in
                    Japan, I would be worrying about losing my Chinese language skills. So, I
                    declined. Some foreign service officers have been able to do both, but I knew I
                    was not one of them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Well, my job was in the external section, to report on Japanese foreign
                    policy in various areas, especially of course China. My other areas of
                    responsibility included the Korean Peninsula, the Soviet Union, and the United
                    Nations. I would go to the Gaimusho (the Japanese foreign ministry) several
                    times a week, and usually call on the deputy director of the relevant office,
                    because the deputy director was my equal in rank at the time. The members of the
                    Japanese foreign ministry all spoke good English, even those for whom English
                    was their second foreign language.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: A very good question. Their basic overall attitude was a bit critical. They
                    felt we were too carried away with China, that we were too emotional. Of course
                    one major concern was that our preoccupation with China would translate into
                    ignoring Japanese interests.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, the Chinese are very good at manipulation. One example was long-time
                    conservative columnist Joe Alsop. He was a friend of Taiwan, and a critic of
                    China, for many decades. Then, sometime in the 1970s I believe, China invited
                    him for a visit and he went. His column afterwards was incredible. He basically
                    said something like, after going to China, he understood that they were
                    communist, but underneath it all, they were still Chinese! Since they were still
                    Chinese, they were basically good. An incredible flip-flop. The Chinese are good
                    at this, and the Japanese are not. The Japanese spend great sums of money on
                    public relations, invite Congressmen and their staffs to Japan, and still most
                    Americans have a warmer feeling towards China. The Chinese have this amazing
                    ability to beguile foreigners that very few other foreign countries have. The
                    Japanese are particularly bad at this, and so are the Koreans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Koreans are in your face.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which I find a pleasant habit in a way. It depends
                        on...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Your mood and on the circumstances. Whereas the Chinese know how to make
                    you feel welcome, and important. They are very good listeners, and rarely spend
                    time trying to impress you. But if you are observant, you notice they rarely
                    talk about themselves, and never gossip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Chinese come across as being almost obsequious.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Not quite. Underneath it all, the Chinese are not obsessed with wanting to
                    be liked. They are very comfortable in their own skins. If they want something
                    from you, they focus on their objective. They do not waste any time on trying to
                    impress you, but on trying to influence you. But they do this is such a pleasant
                    way, that you don't feel manipulated. I think most Americans want to be liked,
                    and the Chinese can sense this and use it to their advantage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the ambassador and the staff called upon you
                        to find out what is going on in China very much?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, Mansfield would, on occasion. But most of the time, he would simply
                    read my reporting. As was well known, the Ambassador was a man of few words.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was known as probably the most laconic man who has ever
                        been in the Senate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, this reminds me of a good story. The first time I was invited to the
                    residence for a social event, I noticed the Ambassador remained in the receiving
                    area. All evening, Mansfield remained in the foyer. I was puzzled as to why he
                    wasn't mixing, so I went up to him and asked if anything was wrong. I think this
                    got him a bit irritated. He just replied that he was fine, and that I should go
                    back and mix. I shouldn't have bothered him, and afterwards, I learned my
                    lesson. The Ambassador didn't like small talk, and he didn't like to socialize.
                    At receptions, he would stay in the foyer, and never mix. Another time,
                    Ambassador Woodcock was in town from Beijing, and I was informed that Ambassador
                    Mansfield wanted me to accompany him in taking Woodcock back to the airport. Now
                    Narita airport is a good two and a half hour ride from Tokyo. Woodcock also
                    didn't talk much. I sat in the back between them, and I counted how many words
                    they said to each other during that time: nine. The atmosphere however was
                    pleasant. They were good friends. But neither talked much. I like to talk, so I
                    went a little crazy, since I couldn't talk unless spoken to. And they did not
                    feel the need to speak to me.</p>
                <p>After saying goodbye at the airport to Woodcock, I did not look forward to the
                    ride home. Finally, I asked the Ambassador if it would be all right to put on
                    the radio and listen to the U.S. armed forces network. He agreed. It was the
                    hour for the news. All of a sudden, there was a commentary tearing into Senators
                    from the oil patch, claiming they were basically bought and did not represent
                    the interests of the country, but only the interests of the oil industry. After
                    the program was over, I asked the Ambassador if he would care to comment. He
                    puffed once on his pipe, then said: “Yup. He's right.” I was so stunned, I was
                    at a loss for words.</p>
                <p>Another advantage of having Mansfield as your ambassador was that you had nothing
                    to fear from visiting Congressional delegations. Usually, you don't know how
                    critical they might be, including to the Ambassador. But with Mansfield there,
                    all Congressmen, and especially Senators, were downright reverential. Usually,
                    the Senators continued to address him as Mr. Leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I left Tokyo in 1980. Having been overseas since 1971, it was time to go
                    back to the United States. My family had doubled. I now had a daughter and a
                    son. My daughter Jennifer was born on Taiwan in 1972, my son Adam was born in
                    Hong Kong in 1975.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening in China in 1980?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Well, paramount leader Deng Xiaoping had launched major economic reforms in
                    1979. Deng had a three-day trip to Japan just as I was leaving, so I was able to
                    end my tour on a high note, doing an analysis of the state of Sino-Japanese
                    relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to in 1980?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: It was time to go back to Washington. The best job I could nail down was
                    the position of deputy director for the office of Pacific Island affairs in the
                    East Asia and Pacific bureau (EAP) at State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you hadn't served in China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: True, but I had served in Hong Kong and Taiwan, had done political
                    reporting on China from Hong Kong, and had reported on aspects of China's
                    foreign relations from Japan. I needed to go back to Washington. My wife
                    especially wanted to return. So I became a Pacific island expert. It was quite
                    interesting. I even got calls from National Geographic. Richard Holbrooke was
                    still assistant secretary for East Asian affairs, and for some reason, he was
                    interested in the Pacific Islands, so I got to know him fairly well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your territory?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: The desk covered all the islands in the Pacific, such as Papua New Guinea,
                    Fiji and Tonga, and all the states of Micronesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I spent one weekend in Micronesia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Micronesia was a U.S. trust, on behalf of the United Nations (UN). At the
                    time, we were negotiating a new status with it, which was called free
                    association. The negotiations were carried out by an office in the Department of
                    the Interior, but State supervised them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a little bit like looking at the slums of a West
                        Virginia small town.</hi>

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>MOHR: So I understand. We didn't do a very good job of nurturing an economy
                    there. It must be noted that Congress played a role in all of this as well. By
                    that I mean the Congressional chairman who had responsibility for Micronesia,
                    Phil Burton, seemed to enjoy having the islanders dependent on his largesse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well we were going through a policy I guess of strategic
                        denial. That was keeping the Soviet fleet from establishing port visits and
                        all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: In Micronesia?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and all over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, that is correct. In the end, we agreed on a status of free
                    association, whereby they would be internally self-governing, and the U.S. was
                    responsible for defense and security issues. We were also willing to train them
                    in the area of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I became part of that in that I spent a week out there
                        talking about setting up a consular service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I maintain that the Chinese should study the model of Micronesia for Tibet.
                    They should apply that to Tibet, that is let Tibet be responsible for its own
                    internal affairs, its own domestic self-government, while China would be
                    responsible for Tibet's defense and security. The Chinese always used to get
                    irritated when I brought up the subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you get involved in any of these Micronesian
                        status negotiations? Some of these small island states hired rather
                        high-powered lobbyists in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Well, I wasn't directly involved, as my duties were limited to the Pacific
                    Island countries. But I would occasionally accompany our ambassador for these
                    negotiations, Peter Rosenblatt, to the Hill for briefings on the status of the
                    negotiations with members of Congress, and also attend policy and negotiating
                    strategy meetings at State and Interior. Speaking of high-powered lobbyists, I
                    was always amazed that the USG gave the Micronesians enough money to hire
                    lawyers for these negotiations from the top law firms in D.C., such as Covington
                    and Burling, to argue against us.</p>

                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>MOHR: There was a bit of drama, because after only one year, the front office in
                    the EAP broke my assignment, and moved me to a similar position in the Office of
                    Taiwan affairs. I was to be involved in significant and important work on the
                    Taiwan desk.</p>

                        from there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is November 5, 2009, with Mark Mohr. Mark, you were
                        last talking about what you were doing in 1981.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Correct. After one year back in Washington, where I had been working in the
                    Office of Pacific Island Affairs, I was then transferred in 1981 to the Office
                    of Taiwan Affairs. Mike Armacost, who was then principal deputy assistant
                    secretary in the bureau, told me we were about to enter into sensitive
                    negotiations with the Chinese over U.S. arm sales to Taiwan, and the office
                    director for Taiwan, Don Ferguson, needed a deputy who was politically sensitive
                    and experienced both on Chinese and Taiwanese matters. The front office felt I
                    was the best person for the job.</p>
                <p>The background is as follows. In 1979, under the Carter administration, we
                    established full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC).
                    We broke diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan. We cancelled
                    our defense treaty with Taiwan. To continue unofficial relations, the U.S. and
                    Taiwan established liaison offices in Washington and Taipei, respectively, with
                    no diplomatic status, but with a charter to carry out economic, commercial,
                    cultural and other forms of non-governmental relations. Our office was—and still
                    is—called the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). Needless to say, the Taiwanese
                    were a bit nervous about the new relationship, so to reassure them, we agreed to
                    continue to supply them with arms, even though we had no defense treaty.
                    Naturally, the PRC did not like us selling arms to Taiwan, after our having
                    established full diplomatic relations with them, and having recognized that
                    there was only one China and that Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
                    agreed there was only one China. This was the language of the normalization
                    document between the U.S. and China. With regard to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan,
                    the PRC view was simple. As one PRC official told me, “Taiwan is part of China.
                    We don't sell arms to Mississippi, so you shouldn't sell arms to Taiwan.”</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>In the fall of 1981, Chinese foreign minister Huang Hua visited Washington and
                    told President Reagan that if we didn't conclude an agreement with them, a
                    bilateral executive agreement to limit arms sales to Taiwan, they were going to
                    downgrade diplomatic relations. Reagan, as I understand it, told Huang that he
                    understood China's position, and suggested that China do what it had to do. He
                    made no commitment. But when then Secretary of State Alexander Haig learned of
                    the Chinese position, he advised the president that the U.S. should enter into
                    such negotiations. To my amazement, the president agreed, and in the first year
                    of the Reagan administration, the State Department led negotiations with the PRC
                    to limit arms sales to Taiwan. It was in this environment that I was transferred
                    to the Taiwan desk, to be the desk's representative, at the working level, for
                    these negotiations.</p>
                <p>I was against these negotiations for several reasons. In principle, I did not see
                    the logic in negotiating with China over our actions toward Taiwan.
                    Additionally, I thought having our relations downgraded, that is, China sending
                    our ambassador home from Beijing while it withdrew its ambassador from
                    Washington, was a small price to pay for continuing to sell arms to Taiwan. I
                    also thought it was possible that Haig was misreading Reagan. I couldn't see how
                    Reagan would ever agree to a date certain to end U.S. arms sales to Taiwan,
                    which is what the Chinese asserted was their main goal for these negotiations.
                    So I was against the negotiations, but participated in the talks and argued my
                    views. For the most part, during the negotiations, my arguments went unheeded,
                    and the negotiations advanced.</p>
                <p>Another reason I thought the negotiations were a bad idea was the existence of
                    the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, once it
                    heard that the Carter Administration was going to normalize with Taiwan, passed
                    the TRA in 1979, both to set up a legal framework for unofficial bilateral
                    relations with Taiwan and also to provide Taiwan with a guarantee that the U.S.
                    would support its defense. Among the TRA's provisions, accordingly, was one
                    asserting that it was the responsibility of the U.S. to provide Taiwan what it
                    needed for its self-defense. The definition of what Taiwan needed was to be left
                    up to the U.S., but nonetheless there was now a law stating the U.S. had certain
                    obligations to provide Taiwan with weapons, with military equipment. However,
                    Alexander Haig wanted to negotiate with the Chinese to limit, and perhaps
                    terminate this obligation. I really thought we were entering into dangerous
                    territory, and felt it would be best not to do so. In my opinion, Haig was a bit
                    panicked over the prospect of having relations with China downgraded on his
                    watch. In any case, he favored the negotiations, and we plunged ahead. The main
                    working level person who moved the negotiations forward was Bill Rope, then
                    director of the office of Chinese affairs at State.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>MOHR: I had lots of arguments with Bill, but we got along. He naturally thought
                    my views were misguided. He would lecture me about the strategic picture, and
                    how I was failing to grasp it. He really wanted a security relationship with
                    China, felt Taiwan was an obstacle toward this goal, and believed with the
                    Taiwan issue gone as an irritant in the U.S.-China relationship, China would
                    grow to be a reliable strategic partner, thereby greatly shifting the strategic
                    balance against the Soviet Union. I argued that China had no interest in being a
                    strategic partner of the United States (it still doesn't), and in any case,
                    neither the president nor the Senate would allow us to do anything that was
                    seriously inimical to Taiwan's defense interests. Bill was supported in Beijing
                    by Chas Freeman, who had been office director for China during normalization,
                    and was now our deputy chief of mission (DCM) in Beijing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have interviewed Chas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, Bill and Chas were the main forces leading the negotiations from the
                    U.S. side, but it is important to remember that they were at all times carrying
                    out the wishes of the secretary of state. Another unusual thing about these
                    negotiations was that there were no checks and balances within the USG. It was a
                    totally State-run policy and negotiation. Jim Lilly, who was a China expert, had
                    been at the National Security Council (NSC) supervising China and Taiwan policy
                    for the White House when he was appointed head of AIT in Taipei. The White
                    House, in its wisdom, felt there was no need to replace Lilly at the NSC anytime
                    soon, despite the fact that we were entering into negotiations with China over
                    limiting arms sales to Taiwan. So throughout the negotiations, which lasted
                    almost a year, there was no NSC person for China to advise the president. Haig
                    also did a pretty good job of keeping the Department of Defense (DOD) and the
                    Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) out of the negotiations. So the China desk at
                    State, in the person of its director, Bill Rope, and sometimes the deputy
                    director, Scott Hallford, essentially did all the work in moving the
                    negotiations forward. Bill kept his bosses informed, but John Holdridge, the
                    assistant secretary of state for East Asia, also fully supported the wisdom of
                    the negotiations and trusted Bill to execute the policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Since I wasn't key to the negotiations, I knew very little at the time they were
                    going on regarding the details, although I was aware of the general trend.
                    However, by the time the agreement was concluded on August 17, 1982, George
                    Shultz had already replaced Alexander Haig as secretary of state. During that
                    summer, Paul Wolfowitz had replaced John Holdridge as assistant secretary of
                    state for East Asian affairs. Wolfowitz was much more conservative than
                    Holdridge, who was a foreign service officer and had been an assistant to
                    Kissinger at the NSC when relations with China had first been established.
                    Wolfowitz was much more skeptical toward China, and much more positive toward
                    Taiwan. In any event, Wolfowitz called me into his office in the spring of 1983,
                    as my tour on the Taiwan desk was winding down, and said he wanted me, and not
                    Bill Rope, to write him a memo detailing the history of the negotiations leading
                    to the agreement concluded in August 1982. This is how I learned a lot of the
                    behind-the-scenes events during the negotiations. I had access to all the
                    secretary to the president (Sec-Pres) memos that Haig had sent detailing our
                    strategy for the negotiations, his suggestions for how to overcome problems
                    raised by the Chinese, etc. If these memos ever become public, they would be a
                    good read. They are fascinating. In my opinion, they indicate that Haig
                    essentially agreed with the Chinese on the need to terminate arms sales to
                    Taiwan, and felt he could win the president over to his views. It is my
                    contention that one of the reasons, perhaps the main reason, for Haig's
                    dismissal in 1983 was that Reagan came to realize that Haig was absolutely
                    serious in his resolve to terminate U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and this was not
                    what Reagan wanted.</p>
                <p>Following the signing of the joint communiqu� in August 1982, the Taiwanese,
                    understandably upset, sent a secret arms buying mission to the U.S. to test
                    Reagan's reassurances to President Chiang Ching-kuo of Taiwan that the
                    communiqu� would not harm Taiwan's security interests. We at State were told by
                    the NSC, just weeks after the signing of the communiqu� with China, that a
                    secret arms buying mission was coming from Taiwan, and that if we wanted to deny
                    the Taiwanese any item from their wish list, the president himself wanted to be
                    informed in detail as to the reasons for the denial. In other words, the White
                    House was telling us, despite the communiqu�, to give Taiwan as much in the way
                    of armaments as possible. It seemed to me that not only did we have a two-China
                    policy, but that the policy was determined by which China could complain the
                    loudest.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>It took about a year for the arms package to be announced for Taiwan. In the
                    meanwhile, in January 1983, there occurred another remarkable event. A
                    conservative magazine, Human Events, published an interview with President
                    Reagan. The interviewer began by asserting that many of the president's
                    supporters were greatly disturbed by the joint communiqu�, believing it had
                    brought great harm to Taiwan. As I recall what was in the magazine, it ran
                    something like this: “Your base is terribly upset. They think you sold out
                    Taiwan. They think you are going to stop arms sales to Taiwan.” To this, Reagan
                    replied, (I am essentially paraphrasing here) “No, not at all. If you read the
                    communiqu� carefully, all it says is that as tensions are reduced between the
                    two sides, Taiwan's need for arms will accordingly be reduced, so at that time,
                    we will reduce our arms sales to Taiwan. It does not say we will willy-nilly
                    reduce arms sales to Taiwan. The U.S. position remains unchanged with regard to
                    the resolution of the differences between China and Taiwan. They can adopt
                    whatever means they feel necessary, so long as it does not include the use of
                    force.”</p>
                <p>One of the reasons I was shocked by what Reagan had said in Human Events magazine
                    was that we were in fact meeting in then deputy secretary of state Larry
                    Eagleburger's office every Saturday following the signing of the communiqu� to
                    plan out what our yearly reduction of arms sales to Taiwan should be. In other
                    words, we were “willy-nilly” meeting to decide how to reduce arms sales to
                    Taiwan on a yearly basis, to show the Chinese we were carrying out the
                    communiqu�. Following the publication of the Human Events article, I raised the
                    issue with deputy secretary Eagleburger. He assured me that the secretary of
                    state (Schultz) and the president were exactly as one on this issue, and our
                    meetings would continue. When I noted this was exactly what he said about the
                    previous secretary (Haig), and that person had been dismissed, Eagleburger
                    snapped that nobody likes a “wise-ass,” and if I was not on board with the
                    program, I could easily be terminated from these meetings. At this point, I
                    decided it was best to keep my mouth shut. The meetings went on, and finally
                    there was agreement to slowly limit arms sales to Taiwan on a yearly basis. Arms
                    sales figures are public, so this would indicate to the Chinese that we were
                    carrying out our commitments under the communiqu�.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>One of the reasons I found these negotiations fascinating is that they revealed a
                    major error in judgment on the part of the Chinese. Traditionally, one of the
                    criticisms of American foreign policy is that American practitioners are not
                    good listeners. We hear only what we want to hear. It is also said that the
                    Chinese are excellent listeners. Well, in the case of the negotiation and
                    aftermath of the communiqu�, when the Chinese realized that U.S. arms sales to
                    Taiwan were not decreasing by any significant amount, and would never in
                    anybody's lifetime go down to zero, they felt that they had been outsmarted by
                    the U.S. I heard this several times during my tour in Beijing from 1988-1990,
                    again from a senior Chinese official when I was in Brisbane in 1993, and again
                    from a senior Chinese friendship association official in 1997. To all of them, I
                    had the same reply: during all the months of the negotiations on the joint
                    communiqu�, you could have easily sent your ambassador in to see President
                    Reagan, or you could have sent your foreign minister to see President Reagan.
                    But you didn't. You chose to believe the words of the secretary of state,
                    Alexander Haig, because you liked what Haig was saying. It agreed with what you
                    thought. This despite the well-know fact that the president is senior to the
                    secretary state, and in this case the president was a conservative Republican
                    with a documented fondness for Taiwan. So, I told the Chinese that actually they
                    had outsmarted themselves, and they had only themselves to blame when the
                    results of the communiqu� were not as they had wished them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: No. I was on the Taiwan desk, and my job was to listen sympathetically to
                    the representatives from Taiwan in Washington when they asked about the status
                    of the negotiations, and then tell them nothing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: No, not on this, because on this, as I said, even most of the rest of the
                    U.S. government did not know what was going on, so there were no leaks. Jim
                    Lilly, formerly of the NSC and then the head of AIT in Taipei, was also kept out
                    of the loop. He was very frustrated. So the Taiwanese did not know what was
                    going on, and they were very anxious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well was the political consideration that you had with the
                        F-16 being produced in Texas, which was George Bush's...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>MOHR: That was later, in the early 1990s, at the end of President Bush's term. At
                    the time when Reagan became president, in 1981, Taiwan wanted the latest
                    advanced fighter, know as the FX. Perhaps this is what agitated the PRC in the
                    first place to demand a communiqu�. In any event, the then head of the NSC,
                    Richard Allen, wanted to sell Taiwan the FX, but Secretary Haig argued against
                    the sale, and won the argument. By then, we had begun negotiations on the
                    communiqu�, and Haig convinced Reagan that while the negotiations were going on,
                    it would be a bad idea to give Taiwan a new fighter jet.</p>
                <p>So when George Bush became president, and he sold the F-16 to Taiwan, the Chinese
                    said, “Ten years ago we signed a communiqu� saying you would limit arms sales to
                    Taiwan, and also limit the quality and quantity of such sales. Now you are
                    selling them your most advanced jet fighter. What is going on?” Some at State
                    somewhat facetiously replied to the Chinese that an election was coming up, the
                    fighter was made in Texas, and Bush needed that state's electoral votes. Thus,
                    this was a purely internal U.S. affair, and as such, the Chinese had no right to
                    complain. The Chinese did not think this “joke” very funny. I actually thought
                    it was, because whenever you raised certain issues with the Chinese, such as
                    human rights, they would respond that it was an internal affair, and the U.S.
                    had no right to interfere in their internal affairs. But I could see where the
                    Chinese would not appreciate the humor regarding a U.S. jet fighter sale to
                    Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anybody who knows the Taiwan issue knows it is a hot
                        potato. The foreign service knows because we had our noses smashed in; the
                        China hands especially suffered. Haig was a Europeanist, a NATO hand.
                        Perhaps he saw the issue from a different perspective, and
                        miscalculated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I agree that he miscalculated, definitely on how far he could bring along
                    the president, but also in his analysis of China's leaders and their motives. In
                    my opinion, Deng Xiaoping was under attack from his left. They were charging
                    that he had engineered the normalization of relations with the United States,
                    but Reagan was now president, and China was not getting anything from the U.S. I
                    believe Deng cooked up this communiqu� idea to look tough to his opposition. I
                    also believe—and this is just speculation— that Deng was as surprised as anyone
                    else when the U.S. agreed to negotiate. Remember, China was only threatening to
                    downgrade relations if we refused to negotiate. It was not threatening to break
                    relations. I hope that someday the Chinese government internal documents will be
                    opened to the public, so we can get a better idea of what Deng was actually
                    thinking. I really don't think they would have broken relations with us had we
                    refused to negotiate. After all, at the time, they needed us far more than we
                    needed them. They were very poor. They needed a big country to buy from them and
                    jump-start their economy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well after you finished this communiqu� business what were
                        you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: The communiqu� was finished in the summer of 1982, and it took about a year
                    to decide what kind of big arms package we would sell to Taiwan without causing
                    a major rift with the PRC. Somehow, we accomplished all this, and by the summer
                    of 1983 I was due for another transfer.</p>
                <p>I applied for a one-year Congressional fellowship, and was accepted to work in
                    the office of Senator John Glenn. At the time, he was chairman of the Senate
                    Foreign Relations subcommittee for East Asia. It was an interesting year. Glenn
                    was a very good man, but he was not your “average” politician. Essentially, he
                    got elected because he was a hero, and would never have any trouble getting
                    reelected from Ohio. He ran for president the year I was in his office, and
                    received only about five percent of the primary vote. This is because he always
                    told the truth as he saw it. He studied an issue very carefully, gave it
                    considerable thought, and then came to a conclusion He never factored in the
                    political consequences. For example, he decided we were too much in debt, so
                    there was a need to raise taxes. Therefore, he campaigned by telling the voters
                    that if he were elected, he would raise their taxes. So, as I said, he received
                    only five percent of the primary vote. It is a little sad to realize that if a
                    politician campaigns on a platform of telling people what needs to be done,
                    rather than what they want to hear, that person can never get elected.</p>
                <p>Another thing I learned while working on the Hill is that there is a different
                    culture in Congress. If you're there, you realize that members actually think,
                    since they make the laws, that they are above the law. This is of course never
                    stated. But to prove my point, just take a look at every labor law passed by
                    Congress. There is always a stipulation that the requirements do not apply to
                    them, at least that was the case up until the early 1980s, when I worked there.
                    There was no such thing as fair labor laws as applied to people who work for the
                    members of Congress. They could be fired on the day, on a whim, without regard
                    to cause or due process. During my stay there, one Republican staffer was fired
                    because the Congressman he worked for learned he was dating a Democratic
                    staffer.</p>
                <p>Another example is that, according to the law, staffers cannot work on political
                    campaigns during normal working hours because they are federal government
                    employees. Those who work on the campaigns are supposed be separate staff, who
                    get paid from campaign funds. If a Congressional staffer wants to work on a
                    campaign, he or she has to do so after work, as a volunteer. But in fact, all
                    staffers, in the Senate and the House, work on political campaigns, and do so
                    during regular working hours. This is illegal, but everyone does it. Since
                    everyone does it, no one points a finger at anyone else.</p>

                <p>After my one-year fellowship, I returned to the Department in the position of
                    deputy director in the East Asian Bureau's office of regional affairs. This was
                    the office that handled issues that cut across more than one country, such as
                    refugee issues. And that is what I worked on: the boat people, the Asian refugee
                    issues. I took a familiarization trip to Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines
                    to visit refugee camps. It was really sad, and moving. So I did what I could to
                    help. It was the aftermath of the Vietnam War.</p>

                <p>MOHR: I really don't recall the details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the orderly departure program was an attempt to get
                        the Vietnamese government to agree to let these people go in an orderly
                        fashion, so that they just wouldn't flee and perhaps drown.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I really don't recall. I think this was before the orderly departure
                    program. My job was to find countries to take the refugees who were in the
                    camps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a lot of concern about the Thais and all, as
                        they were getting people from Cambodia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: The only recollection I have for that period was that, on my
                    familiarization trip, I went to Thailand and took a trip to the border. It was
                    unmarked. Just miles of road, and the Thais said, “On the other side of the road
                    is Cambodia.” I replied, “Oh, Ok, if you say so.” Then we heard some gunshots on
                    the Cambodian side and departed in haste.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well we are talking about 1983, what did you do then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I worked in the office of regional affairs. Aside from refugee work, I also
                    coordinated policy papers, with input from the various desks. I don't think the
                    work was very challenging, because I don't remember much from that time. I think
                    my biggest goal was to get out of that office as soon as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>MOHR: I actually managed to cut my tour of duty short and get out after one year.
                    I got lucky. The State Department had training fellowships, usually for one
                    year, and they usually went to people in the geographic bureaus. Now the
                    political-military bureau (PM) argued that they should be allotted some training
                    slots, to train people in political-military affairs. The Department of
                    Personnel finally agreed, but when the decision was made, it was well into the
                    spring of 1984, and most people had already received their assignments, so
                    personnel told PM that if they could find people willing to take the
                    fellowships, those people could break their current assignments. I had a friend
                    in PM, and he told me about the fellowships. It was perfect. I broke my
                    assignment in regional affairs and went to the University of Maryland (I didn't
                    want to leave my family) to study arms control. I already had an ongoing
                    assignment once I finished studying: to be the action officer for the
                    Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) negotiations. I enjoyed my studies at the
                    University of Maryland immensely. In addition to a course on the history of
                    nuclear weapons negotiations, I took a course on the history of the Soviet
                    Union. I also helped teach a course on U.S.-alliance relations. While the
                    professor handled NATO, I discussed U.S. relations with Japan and Korea. After
                    finishing my studies in mid-1985, I began my job as the INF officer in PM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is INF?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Intermediate nuclear forces. These are missiles that can carry nuclear
                    warheads and travel from 500 to 5500 kilometers. Basically, those were our
                    missiles in western Europe that could hit the Soviet Union, and comparable
                    Soviet missiles that could hit western European capitals. Our basing countries
                    were the United Kingdom, Italy, West Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands. We
                    had two kinds of INF missiles: the Pershing IIs, which were ballistic missiles,
                    and ground-launched cruise missiles, or GLCMs, which were much slower. The
                    Soviets had only one missile, the SS-20, but it was a ballistic missile, and
                    they had about 2000 of them. We had about 500 INF missiles. So we were
                    outgunned, so to speak.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seemed to be a ploy on the part of the Soviets, perhaps
                        their last major ploy in an attempt to break up NATO.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>MOHR: Well, there was a lot of opposition in the basing countries among the
                    people, who believed that if U.S. INF missiles were installed in their
                    countries, that would only increase the likelihood of their being targeted by
                    Soviet missiles. Of course, they already were targeted by Soviet nuclear
                    missiles. But in any case, there were lots of protests. The Soviets at the time
                    did not have such problems as a protesting public, but they had other problems.
                    They produced so many SS-20s that they also had enough to target U.S. bases in
                    Japan and South Korea, which did not endear them to those countries, and given
                    the Sino-Soviet split, they pointed a few SS-20s at the Chinese. The Soviets
                    thought this was no big deal, just an upgrade of previous nuclear missiles aimed
                    at China. However, because the SS-20s were much more powerful, their deployment
                    really upset the countries of northeast Asia, so the net result was that the
                    deployment of these new missiles made Soviet relations in Asia worse, not
                    better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the INF negotiations concerned U.S. missiles in Europe
                        that could hit the Soviet Union, and Soviet missiles that could hit Europe.
                        It did not involve strategic missiles, those Soviet missiles that could hit
                        the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: That's correct. I think most people involved in the negotiations in the USG
                    believed that if we could eliminate both sides' INF missiles, this would be a
                    great victory for us, since the Soviets had 2000 and we had only 500. Just as
                    important, it would be the first nuclear arms negotiation between the two sides
                    to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons. Previous nuclear arms
                    negotiations had put a ceiling on a particular kind of nuclear weapon, but those
                    weapons remained in existence. This negotiation, if successful, would really be
                    a historic first.</p>
                <p>As background, the major players from the U.S. side were the Department of State;
                    two players from the Department of Defense, representatives from the Joint
                    Chiefs of Staff (JCS—the uniformed military), and representatives from the
                    office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD—the civilians); the CIA; and the Arms
                    Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA). These five agencies had to clear on all
                    position papers. If there was disagreement between the agencies, a Sec-Pres
                    (secretary of state to the president) memo had to be produced. The memo would
                    spell out the positions of each side, and then the NSC, acting on behalf of the
                    president, would make its decision so the negotiations could move forward. I was
                    in charge of drafting the Sec-Pres memos. Each agency's viewpoint had to be
                    accurately reflected, and of course, each agency had to clear on the memo.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>The big obstacle throughout the many years of the INF negotiation was that
                    although four agencies (State, JCS, CIA and ACDA) were almost always in
                    agreement, OSD was almost always opposed to anything that would move the
                    negotiations along. OSD almost always won in the final NSC decision following
                    submission of a Sec-Pres memo, which was the reason these negotiations had been
                    dragging on for years. I don't know for sure why the OSD position usually
                    prevailed against all the other government agencies, including the uniformed
                    military (the JCS), but it was probably because the President favored the OSD
                    position at the time and didn't really want to make progress on the treaty.</p>
                <p>In the course of my work, I developed a friendship with someone from OSD and he
                    explained to me the basic thinking of Richard Pearle, assistant secretary of
                    defense for the bureau that handled the INF negotiations, and Frank Gaffney, his
                    principal deputy.As Pearle and Gaffney analyzed the situation, according to this
                    official, the Soviet Union would always win out against the U.S. in a true
                    negotiation. This was because the U.S. was saddled with Congress and the media,
                    who were always pushing for compromise. Since the Soviet Union did not have to
                    answer to its legislature or its press, it could hold to its positions. The U.S.
                    would be pressured to compromise, the Soviet Union wouldn't, so in the end, the
                    Soviets would “win” under such circumstances. To counter this, Pearle and
                    Gaffney felt the key was to be in negotiations with the Soviets, but never get
                    any results. The reason to be in the INF negotiations was to appease our
                    European allies. If we refused to be in negotiations, they would be upset and
                    create all sorts of problems with the nuclear missiles we had based in their
                    countries, even to the point someday of unilaterally insisting they be removed.
                    So, according to this viewpoint, we definitely should be constantly negotiating
                    with the Soviets over the INF missiles, but we should throw up so many obstacles
                    that there would never be any chance of ever getting an agreement. I know this
                    sounds bizarre, but I believe that once the record of the negotiations becomes
                    public, it will easily be seen—up until the final year of the negotiations, when
                    the U.S. became far more flexible for reasons I will explain later—that the
                    Soviet negotiating stance was more reasonable by far than ours.</p>
                <p>What finally broke the stalemate in the negotiations (and my source here was the
                    NSC official in charge of the INF negotiations) was a decision by Nancy Reagan.
                    She wanted a victory for the president in the last year of his second term, and
                    decided that an INF treaty was achievable. Actually, I think the country owes
                    Mrs. Reagan a great deal of gratitude for her decision. In any case, she spoke
                    to the president and he decided to break the deadlock. I was asked by the chief
                    advisor to the Secretary of State for arms control, Jim Timbie, if we were in a
                    position to get a treaty. I answered in the negative, explaining that previous
                    Sec-Pres decisions by the NSC had pretty much ruled out the possibility of
                    securing a treaty. He told me if I knew what a “reclama” was. I said I did
                    not.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>He explained it was sending a decision memo over to the NSC for reconsideration
                    of a previous decision. So I began sending reclama memos to the White House to
                    reconsider previous decisions. It was the usual format: State, JCS, CIA and ACDA
                    favor position A, OSD favors position B. Previous decision memos returned from
                    the NSC had always come down in favor of position B. The first time I sent a
                    reclama memo, it came down in favor of position A. To say I was overjoyed would
                    be an understatement. I now believed a treaty was obtainable. I sent out a slew
                    of memos, and most of the decisions, the really important ones, came back
                    reversing previous decisions and allowing the negotiations to move forward in
                    earnest. Pearle and Gaffney were so upset by this turn of events, which occurred
                    I believe toward the end of 1986, that they resigned their positions in
                    government.</p>
                <p>A treaty was finally concluded with the Soviets in time to be signed by the
                    president and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Christmas 1987. For about a
                    year leading up to the signing, I never worked so hard in my life. Instead of
                    working by myself, I was actually given a staff of two people. Before this time,
                    we would have interagency meetings to plan negotiating strategy about once a
                    month. Now, we had such meetings daily. I had to draft the memos for the
                    meetings, attend and take notes, then communicate the decisions to the
                    delegation, then convey their thoughts back to the interagency meeting, etc. I
                    awoke every morning around 6am, was in the office by about 7, and went home
                    towards midnight. State paid for a taxi to take me home. (I must have been
                    really important.) This was the schedule during the week. On weekends, we worked
                    Saturdays from about9 a.m.- 4 p.m., and Sundays for a few hours. (On weekends, I
                    drove to work; I had my own parking pass.) It was really grueling, but very
                    exciting, because we all knew that we were making history.</p>
                <p>The last two weeks before Christmas were particularly interesting. I received a
                    call to come over to the White House, where the senior NSC official asked me how
                    many key issues were still unresolved. I replied that there were about half a
                    dozen, and given the cumbersome nature of the interagency clearing process, I
                    doubted whether we could reach our self-imposed Christmas deadline. He told me
                    simply to put all the outstanding remaining issues in a memo from him directly
                    to the president, and the president would make the necessary decisions. He
                    commented pointedly that we would be bypassing the Department of Defense. He
                    said afterward I could send an “official” Sec-Pres memo, but that would simply
                    be for the bureaucratic record. I was stunned that he was telling me to do this
                    outside the bureaucracy, but also extremely excited.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>So I did as instructed, and it worked exactly as he said it would. The memo went
                    to the president, and he approved all my recommended options. The last
                    roadblocks were cleared, and we would have a treaty. Gorbachev came in December
                    and signed the treaty with Reagan. Of course, much of the elation lessened when
                    the realization hit that we still had to work hard to get the treaty ratified by
                    the Senate. That took an additional six months. Jesse Helms was chairman of the
                    Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and he was of course opposed to the treaty.
                    He tried to create many obstacles, even down to little things such as sending in
                    an endless stream of questions to the Department, each of which had to be
                    answered within days. Despite all his efforts, we secured 93 votes in favor of
                    treaty ratification. We had actually accomplished something historic. As I noted
                    previously, the INF treaty was the first arms control treaty between the U.S.
                    and the Soviet Union which eliminated, rather than capped, an entire class of
                    nuclear weapons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this is all completed. In what odor were you with the
                        rest of the Department? Did they feel you had gotten out of line and
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: No, we were all praised. The paper trail was sorted out, there was great
                    acclaim in the media, and on Capitol Hill. All those who worked on the treaty
                    received step increases and salary bonuses. A few months later, all those in the
                    interagency who worked on the treaty got to meet President Reagan. There were
                    about 30 of us in the room with him. He gave a short speech thanking all of us
                    for our work, and then we all had our pictures taken individually with him
                    shaking our hands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: By the time the INF treaty was ratified, it was the summer of 1988, and I
                    really wanted to go back to doing something involving China. I was fortunate. I
                    secured the job as deputy director of the political section in Embassy Beijing.
                    The only drawback was that, at the time, there was no English language school in
                    Beijing. State would have paid for my children to go to an international school
                    in Japan, but my wife and I decided it would be least complicated if they all
                    remained in the U.S. and I went to Beijing by myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went out to Beijing when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: In August of 1988. I remembered that the night before I was to leave, the
                    basement of our house flooded, so we were up most of the night mopping up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Beijing from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>MOHR: From the summer of 1988 to the summer of 1990. In those days, Beijing was a
                    two-year tour, because there were none of the amenities that there are today,
                    such as the world's largest McDonalds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there during 1989.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Oh yes, I was an eyewitness to the entire Tiananmen Incident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got out there who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: During my first year, Winston Lord was the ambassador. His tour, of over
                    five years, ended in the spring of 1989, just as the events were taking place
                    which would lead up to the Tiananmen Incident of June 4, 1989.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have interviewed Winston Lord.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: That should have been interesting. I think it would be good to stop here,
                    and continue next time. Is that all right?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely. So we will pick this up in 1988 when you are
                        off to Beijing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Excellent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is December 3, 2009, with Mark Mohr. Mark we were
                        going to pick this up as you were arriving in Beijing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, without my family, to take up my new job as deputy director of the
                    political section in Embassy Beijing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Two years. I arrived the summer of 1988. I had just arrived when we were
                    hit by a veritable blizzard of senior level visits. As I recall, there were four
                    Secretary-level visits in six weeks. I was responsible for coordinating all the
                    meetings and the reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about in 1988. How were relations with
                        China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: They were getting better. With regard to living in China and being able to
                    do our work, things were improving markedly. For the first time the Chinese were
                    agreeing to accept invitations for lunch or dinner at our homes. So we could
                    actually talk to them in social settings, ask questions, and get some answers.
                    Things were warming up. So under Ambassador Winston Lord, things were getting
                    better. We had the usual trade, non-proliferation, and human rights problems,
                    but they were being managed. There was just less tension. There was a feeling
                    that we were just beginning to get somewhere, that we were on the verge of a
                    real breakthrough in relations. Then President Bush came to China in February
                    1989, and things took a turn for the worse.</p>
                <p>The visit had been going well until the February “return” dinner in Beijing,
                    which is the one given by the U.S. side following the dinner by the Chinese
                    side. One of the guests the President had invited was Fang Lizhi, an
                    astrophysicist who had been critical of the regime. The year before, in an
                    interview in Hong Kong, Fang attacked the Chinese leadership for nepotism,
                    singling out the special positions of the children of key leaders. Nevertheless,
                    despite such criticism, Fang had been allowed to keep his job and to talk to
                    foreign journalists. So we invited him to the Bush dinner, as a symbol of a
                    regime critic. But apparently Fang was particularly disliked by Deng Xiaoping,
                    and Deng ordered that Fang physically be prevented from attending the dinner.
                    Fang was blocked by Chinese police about a block from the hotel where the
                    banquet was taking place. It was a strange situation, and the embassy and the
                    White House drew much subsequent criticism for inviting Fang. Yet, as I stated
                    above, he clearly was not one of the most punished regime critics. The only
                    sanction against him was he was not allowed to attend physics conferences
                    overseas. Within China, he was not being punished. If Deng disliked him so much,
                    why weren't there more sanctions against him? And why did the regime wait until
                    the last minute, until Fang was about a block from the banquet hotel, to deny
                    him entrance? These are questions still to be answered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Soviet Union, in totalitarian regimes, you get this
                        sometimes when relations are getting better, you have essentially the
                        security forces on their own going out to screw things up. I mean this
                        happens again and again. This is power within power. I was just wondering
                        was this a possibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>MOHR: That is a very good point. Well certainly it is a possibility. The
                    situation certainly was a mess, because the Chinese deliberately embarrassed the
                    president of the United States. More importantly, it revealed to us in the
                    Embassy that “something was rotten in Denmark.” It indicated a kind of weakness
                    in the leadership, perhaps controversy over the state of the U.S.-China
                    relationship amongst elements in the Chinese government, to which you just
                    alluded. We in the political section, with the support of the ambassador,
                    decided to fan out and press all our contacts in Beijing about the sensitive
                    topic of what was going on within the Chinese leadership. To beef up our
                    analytical efforts, we also recruited a Chinese political expert from within the
                    USG in Washington. Our deputy chief of mission, Peter Thomson, didn't think the
                    Fang incident was all that big a deal. Embassy political counselor Ray
                    Burghardt, economic counselor Jim Larocco and I disagreed with Peter. We had
                    many lively debates. We gleaned over the next few months from our Chinese
                    contacts that something was indeed wrong, but frustratingly, no one would offer
                    any specifics. Then, on April 15, 1989, former Chinese party chief Hu Yaobang
                    died, the students started protesting, and events were put in train that
                    eventually led to the shooting of the students on June 4.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you learned any details of the problems within the
                        political leadership?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: There was a split in the leadership. A few years before, Deng Xiaoping had
                    purged Hu Yaobang as head of the Chinese Communist Party. Zhao Ziyang moved from
                    premier to party chief, and Li Peng took over as premier. Hu had favored an
                    opening up of Chinese society, and was particularly beloved in academic circles
                    and by the students. Deng put a lid on Hu's attempted reforms, and Li Peng kept
                    the lid on. So Li was not popular. When Hu died in April, the students began
                    expressing their aggravation that a good man had died, while in their opinion a
                    bad man (Li Peng) still lived. They expressed their protest in rallies and in
                    posters in the days following Hu's death. Of course, this was incendiary stuff.
                    The students all camped out in Tiananmen Square. They took over the running of
                    downtown Beijing. Finally on May 20, the regime declared martial law in the area
                    around Tiananmen Square . Troops were brought in. And sometime after midnight,
                    June 4, they fired on the students, killing many. The shooting, courtesy of
                    international television, whose personnel had been brought in to cover the visit
                    of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to Beijing May 15-18, was broadcast around
                    the world. The reason that the situation had gotten to the point of violence,
                    again, was that the party was split on how to deal with the students. Party
                    chief Zhao Ziyang, who was politically a moderate and in favor of many of the
                    positions that Hu Yaobang had taken, wanted a dialogue with the students.
                    Premier Li Peng wanted to deal with the students harshly, taking a typically
                    old-line communist party position. Li had the support of Deng Xiaoping, so
                    eventually Zhao was marginalized and the troops were given the order to use
                    lethal force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really seemed incredible.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, I was an eyewitness to the events of June 4 around Tiananmen Square,
                    although from the vantage point of a hotel room located on the 15th floor of the
                    Beijing Hotel. How did I get to the 15th floor of this hotel? Let me explain.
                    Once martial law had been declared in May, it was very difficult to report from
                    the square. Cell phones hadn't been invented yet, so you had to go to the
                    nearest public phone, located in the lobby of the Beijing Hotel, and call in
                    whatever you had to report from there. But there were only a limited number of
                    public phones at the hotel, and all the reporters wanted access to them as well,
                    so you had to wait your turn on line. Then I suggested to the ambassador that we
                    rent out a room in the Beijing Hotel, so embassy officers could go to the room
                    and use the phone there. They could also shower, or take a nap. The ambassador
                    approved. The room, as I noted above, was on the 15th floor, and had a view of
                    the main avenue, Chang'an Jie. It did not look onto the square, but from the
                    room, you could see the entrance to the square.</p>
                <p>On the day of June 3, I was one of the members from the Embassy assigned to
                    report on events from Tiananmen Square. I arrived during the day, and was still
                    there towards midnight. Sometime after 11 p.m., we could hear gunfire coming
                    from the westerly direction off the square. A few minutes later, a group of
                    students came to us and said that army troops were moving toward the square, and
                    it would be best for our safety if we left. We agreed, and departed the square.
                    As we were crossing Chang An Jie to get to the Beijing Hotel, an amazing thing
                    happened. Now you have to picture the scene. Tanks were moving towards us from
                    our left. Although they were still a few hundred yards away, we were trying to
                    get across the street as soon as we could. Suddenly, a man on a bicycle swerved
                    and cut us off. He stopped his bike, looked at us, and asked, “Change money?” He
                    was actually a black-market money changer, and despite all that was going on
                    around us, wanted to know if we were interested in changing dollars into Chinese
                    currency. In retrospect, it was clearly a sign that the Chinese entrepreneurial
                    spirit was alive and well. At the time, however, we just wanted to get across
                    the street to the safety of the hotel, so we declined his offer and moved
                    on.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Once we got to the room, as I mentioned above, you could not see what was going
                    on in the square itself, but you could see the troops and tanks coming down the
                    street, and then turning into the square. This was nighttime, so visibility was
                    not optimum. But you could clearly hear the tanks moving and the gunshots. One
                    particularly heartbreaking thing was that I could make out a long phalanx of
                    bicycles, the main means of transport for the Chinese people at the time, moving
                    in the opposite direction, that is to say away, fleeing away from the main tank
                    column. This was of course quite logical. However, one thin line of bicycles was
                    moving in the opposite direction, directly toward the advancing tank column. I
                    assumed these were people who had simply snapped. They were so angry at army
                    troops firing live ammunition at citizens that they just decided to drive their
                    bikes into the tanks. It was suicidal, and all I could do was watch. Again,
                    visibility was poor, but I could make out the gunshots and the sounds of bikes
                    tumbling over. I was deeply moved and very upset, but there was nothing I could
                    do except mumble silent prayers that the “bike column” turn itself around, and
                    move away from the troops. After a certain amount of time I just couldn't watch
                    anymore. There were other embassy people in the room, and I was exhausted, both
                    emotionally and physically, so I went home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you knew something had to happen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Actually most observers, including myself (but not Ambassador Lilly),
                    predicted that the Chinese military would never use lethal force against unarmed
                    students. Lilly had grown up in China. He father was an oil executive, so he had
                    a better “gut” feel for Chinese actions. He predicted the June 4 massacre. The
                    rest of us saw the events unfolding, but we rationalized the situation. I had
                    one luncheon conversation with the Polish deputy chief of mission, whose last
                    name was Goralczyk. He was regarded as the most astute observer of the Chinese
                    political regime among the east Europeans. Goralczyk had studied at Beijing
                    University in the 1950s, had married a Chinese woman, spoke Chinese fluently,
                    and had spent about two decades in China.</p>
                <p>He began the luncheon by lecturing me (in a friendly manner), explaining the
                    difference in a communist state between the army and the police. The army, he
                    said, fights foreigners. That is to say, the Chinese army is geared to fight the
                    external threat, which at that time was the Soviet Union. It is the job of the
                    police, Goralczyk maintained, to deal with dissidents and protests. Goralczyk
                    concluded that I could inform Washington that the Chinese police would clear the
                    students out of Tiananmen Square. I didn't have to worry about the Chinese army,
                    he said, because they would never fire on the students.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>So I reported this conversation. I thought I had done a brilliant job, and I
                    noted in my report that all the foreign contacts I had spoken to agreed with
                    Goralczyk. I sided with Goralczyk, and predicted to Washington that the Chinese
                    would not use guns against the students. Events were to prove both Goralczyk and
                    I spectacularly wrong. As I said, the ambassador wrote his own cable, and his
                    prediction turned out to be the correct one. I recall the conversation I had
                    with the ambassador after he read my Goralczyk cable. He said, “What is this?” I
                    replied , “It's what Goralczyk said.” He went on, “Do you believe him?” I said,
                    “I want to believe him.” He said, “That is the trouble with you people. You want
                    to believe. But that's not good enough. They (the Chinese army) are going to
                    shoot them (the students).”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So let's talk about how this was developing. Were you and
                        your officers in the political section of the embassy able to go out and
                        talk to students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Oh yes. I was in charge of the duty list. We had at least two officers per
                    shift, from throughout the embassy, on duty at Tiananmen Square. There were
                    three eight-hour shifts per day, so we had 24-hour coverage. We instituted the
                    duty roster at the start of martial law, in May. I personally pulled many
                    shifts, and overall must have spoken to hundreds of students. Their spirit was
                    very inspiring. When they found out I was from the Embassy, they often asked me
                    to autograph their shirtsleeve. They all approved that the Embassy had given
                    political asylum to Fang Lizhi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this sort of Tiananmen business as it was developing
                        as amorphous as it seems, just happening as a conjunction of forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Well, the students were fairly organized, but no one knew where events
                    would lead, so those events did have an amorphous quality to them. One of the
                    fundamental mistakes the students made was that they didn't tap into popular
                    support, especially from the workers. Chinese society has deep class division
                    between educated and uneducated people. The students had a traditionally
                    negative view of the workers, so they did not think it necessary to bring them
                    on board. Had they done so, in my opinion, they might have succeeded in toppling
                    Li Peng. However these were college students, so it is not surprising that they
                    were not terribly politically astute. Also, the main student leaders on the
                    square began to take on characteristics of the Chinese leadership. They were
                    always at meetings, and if you asked to see one, the reply would be, “The
                    meeting place is secret.” (All students at the time lived and met on Tiananmen
                    Square, so they couldn't have been too far away.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the students had a real goal?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>MOHR: Well, they said they wanted more freedom, a more open society, and they
                    wanted to put an end to political corruption. These were all noble goals, and
                    the students were predictably idealistic and na�ve. It was a mistake, in my
                    opinion, to declare one of their goals as democracy, and buttress this with the
                    erection of a statue which they named the “Goddess of Democracy.” While the
                    statue was wildly popular with the western media, the statue and the advocacy
                    for democracy only made the leaders more paranoid and certain that the United
                    States was behind the movement. In any case, I believe that if Zhao Ziyang had
                    won the policy debate, he could have diffused the student protest. But he lost
                    the debate—and his position—and was placed under house arrest, where he remained
                    until his death.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When this movement started, how were you in the political
                        section seeing it before it really gained momentum? Were you seeing it as
                        this is another little episode that would be blown away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: We knew something was wrong at the time of President Bush's visit in
                    February 1989, because they acted so awkwardly to prevent Fang Lizhi from
                    attending the banquet. The trigger for the student movement was the death of Hu
                    Yaobang on April 15, and you can't foresee someone's death. At the beginning of
                    the student movement, there weren't all that many students on the square. Then
                    the regime, in its ham-handed wisdom, issued an editorial in People's Daily
                    April 26 denouncing the students for their protests and occupation of the square
                    and questioning their motives, which only angered the students and added
                    momentum to the movement. After the editorial, the movement grew rapidly, to the
                    point that there were hundreds of thousands of students occupying the heart of
                    downtown Beijing. Still the regime did nothing. We knew something was very
                    wrong, but we had no idea what the divisions were within the leadership, or who
                    was arguing with who.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an equivalent there of a criminal element who
                        might have been taking advantage of the situation? Was there any evidence of

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: No, it was a movement clearly led by college students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I remember watching it on TV. I also recall that at
                        the time of the Gorbachev visit, seeing Gorbachev sort of being hustled into
                        the back entrance. It was rather remarkable.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>MOHR: Gorbachev's visit was to be the crowning achievement in Deng Xiaoping's
                    career in terms of foreign policy, the foreign policy equivalent to his domestic
                    policy achievement of reforming the economy and moving it forward. But the
                    students ruined Gorbachev's visit. They were out on the square protesting, the
                    international media was broadcasting the images to the world, and it looked like
                    the Chinese leadership had lost control of the downtown of their capitol city.
                    In Chinese cultural terms, the students made Deng Xiaoping lose face, and he was
                    furious. I believe that the student movement having made a mockery of the
                    Gorbachev visit was one of the reasons that Deng decided to use lethal force “to
                    teach the students a lesson.”</p>
                <p>One ironic fallout from the student movement vis-�-vis the Gorbachev visit was
                    that the USG “worry quotient” was greatly ratcheted down. From the time of the
                    announcement of the visit, the U.S. government's public stance was that no one
                    was worried. In fact, they were extremely worried. We at the embassy were told
                    to devote all reporting resources exclusively to the visit. I was put in charge
                    of coordinating these efforts. I was told that Gorbachev's visit was to be the
                    biggest event for the embassy that year. Clearly, Washington was concerned that
                    the strategic winds were about to shift and that the rapprochement between the
                    Soviet Union and China would mean some kind of net strategic loss for the United
                    States. In the event, the death of Hu Yaobang and the rise of the student
                    movement totally marginalized Gorbachev's visit. As one example, I recall that
                    the front page of the People's Daily on the day of Gorbachev's visit devoted
                    only a tiny article in the bottom right hand corner of page one to it. All other
                    space on page one of the paper was covered by pictures and stories of the
                    students massing on Tiananmen Square.</p>
                <p>The Tiananmen Incident occurred on Saturday-Sunday, June 3-4. On Tuesday, amidst
                    the chaos, I received a call from the Chinese foreign ministry, informing me
                    that if I was still interested, I could be briefed on Gorbachev's visit the
                    following Saturday. What would have been the most important report of my tour in
                    Beijing now would be only a side show. I called Washington to see if they were
                    interested in my going to receive the read-out. I was told to go and write up
                    the report, but the person on the other end of the line said: “Of course, you
                    realize no one is going to read it.”</p>

                <p>MOHR: Well, the banquet was in the Great Hall of the People, which is right in
                    Tiananmen Square. To get there, you had to go through all the students. It was a
                    mess. Kids were running around, jumping, screaming and protesting. As I said, it
                    was a big loss of face for the leadership, and incredible when you think all of
                    this was taking place under the governance of one of the most tightly controlled
                    communist parties in the world. But as I said, the leadership was deeply divided
                    as to how to handle the situation, so for many weeks there was paralysis, and
                    the students did their thing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: There were all sorts of rumors in April and May that the visit was going to
                    be postponed. We would go to the Soviets and they would say that the visit was
                    going to take place. I mean that was all we would get out of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Returning to the night of June 4, what I have heard is
                        that first they tried to use troops of the Beijing garrison, and that they
                        weren't reliable and they had to basically go out and get peasants or
                        something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Unreliable is putting it mildly. The military leaders of the Beijing
                    Military Region refused to carry out the orders to fire on the public. It took
                    Deng Xiaoping about six weeks to find troops from other regions who were willing
                    to carry out the order to shoot the students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk about when you first arrived in Beijing in
                        the summer of 1988. Were you getting any people talking about the Great Leap
                        Forward or the Cultural Revolution, basically all these horrible things that
                        happened to just about everybody.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>MOHR: Chinese officials would never talk about such things, but shopkeepers and
                    taxi cab drivers, ordinary people would. You realized almost every Chinese
                    person had a “story,” and almost all of them were of sadness and suffering. One
                    thing I learned in the weeks after I arrived was that although Mao had been
                    extremely popular with undergraduates and leftists in the U.S., almost no
                    Chinese had a good word to say about his rule from 1949 to 1976. Actually, the
                    stories people told me were so sad that it got to the point where I just got
                    exhausted hearing about them. And then Tiananmen happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well at the time after the shooting and all, were you
                        looking to see what was happening in the rest of China, in Shanghai for
                        example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Of course. We have consulates in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang and Chengdu,
                    and the reporting from those posts was excellent. There were student movements
                    in all the major cities. Shanghai's was the largest outside of Beijing, but no
                    one was shot. They never used lethal force. They somehow successfully got the
                    students dispersed without any loss of life. Ziang Zemin was the leader in
                    Shanghai. I believe after it was all over, the reason why he was appointed to be
                    head of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was because of the way he successfully
                    handled the student movement in Shanghai. So in the provinces there were a lot
                    of copycat movements to mimic what was going on in Beijing, but they never got
                    totally out of hand. It seemed that the provincial leadership, especially in
                    Shanghai, did a much better job of handling the student protests so they didn't
                    escalate into violence. Nonetheless, my theory is that lethal force was never
                    necessary in Beijing either, but Deng had suffered so much during the Cultural
                    Revolution, which was powered by students, and he was so angry with the students
                    over the fiasco of the Gorbachev visit, that he wanted to use lethal force so
                    that the students, and anyone else in Chinese society so inclined, would never
                    ever again be tempted to protest against the regime like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about students they were essentially the
                        Red Guard weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: During the Cultural Revolution they were the Red Guards. During the
                    Tiananmen Incident, they were just students. They organized themselves into a
                    form of government around Tiananmen Square, but they had no special name. They
                    were just college-aged kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Red Guards were young kids too, but they had proved to
                        be sort of under the tutelage of Mao to be as nasty as you can imagine.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>MOHR: Exactly, and the students of 1989 reminded Deng of all of those unpleasant
                    experiences of the Cultural Revolution. After all, one of his brothers was
                    killed, and his son was thrown off a building and crippled for life. This was
                    all at the hands of the Red Guards, of students. So I believe Deng wanted to use
                    lethal force, even though it was not necessary. The regime of course insisted
                    that it was necessary. However, I was a witness to the events. At the height of
                    the student movement, sometime in May, there were hundreds of thousands of
                    students at Tiananmen. They filled the entire square. But by the beginning of
                    June, enthusiasm had waned, and I estimated the number of students at Tiananmen
                    Square on Saturday morning, June 3, at no more than five thousand.</p>
                <p>Then something curious happened. Loudspeakers around the city began telling
                    people not to gather around the square that evening. All day long, the
                    loudspeakers blared: “People, do not come to Tiananmen Square this evening.” So
                    naturally, thousands of people came to Tiananmen Square that evening, and once
                    again the square was filled with people. But these were just observers, not
                    student squatters. However, the regime could now claim that once again the
                    square was filled, and that no regime could let the heart of its capital be
                    controlled by an unruly mob. They insisted afterward that because of the great
                    number of people who had taken over the square, they were compelled to use
                    lethal force to regain control. But this claim was bogus. The real number of
                    people by the night of June 3 occupying the square was far closer to just a few
                    thousand. Twice as many police, with clubs, could have cleared the square. But
                    the regime wanted to clear the square with the army, using rifles, and live
                    ammunition.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, the shooting takes place, what happens then? Did
                        everything shut down as far as we were concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes it did. For a day or two afterwards, there was not even any place open
                    to buy food. One of the secretaries had a huge jar of peanut butter. That's what
                    we ate for two days, until the owners of the food stores and restaurants came
                    back later in the week. Our apartments also didn't have water, so the embassy
                    rented out a hotel room at the Jianguo Hotel, within walking distance from the
                    Embassy. There was a sign-up sheet at the embassy for the hotel room, in order
                    to go there and shower or bathe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about after Tiananmen? Was the Chinese government
                        almost closed off to the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>MOHR: It was almost totally closed off. Since the PRC official line was that
                    China didn't do anything wrong, and that all sanctions against China, including
                    those from other foreign governments, were originated and orchestrated by the
                    U.S., we were not very popular with the Chinese government. So every Chinese
                    government agency was closed off to us. This lasted several months. The only
                    contact we had was a once-a-week meeting at the foreign ministry. The ambassador
                    was called in to be lectured to on how bad we were, and why the sanctions needed
                    to end. (U.S. sanctions, imposed by President Bush, included an end to all
                    military cooperation and a ban on high-level Chinese visits to the U.S.) I was
                    the note-taker at the weekly meetings between the ambassador and the senior
                    Chinese foreign ministry official, Liu Huaqiu. Otherwise, there was nothing to
                    do. Many of us worked out in the newly opened health clubs, and the Chinese
                    language officers studied Chinese. It was most strange. We were an embassy, but
                    the host government would not talk to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you get out into the countryside or travel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: To go anywhere outside of Beijing, even in normal times, required
                    permission from the Chinese government. In the months after Tiananmen, we
                    couldn't go anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The same thing was happening to our consular
                        officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, in terms of travel. Another thing that really bothered the Chinese was
                    that we gave political asylum to astrophysicist and dissident Fang Lizhi. He
                    lived on the ambassador's compound. They registered their dislike about that.
                    But with the man-in-the-street, we were extremely popular. People would walk up
                    to me on the street and ask if Fang was at the embassy. When I would reply that
                    he was, they would give me the thumbs up sign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about other embassies?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>MOHR: That is a good question. I think we were the only ones who got the cold
                    shoulder. I remember the Japanese having a parliamentary visit about a month or
                    two later. The visiting delegation had a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Peng,
                    and this is where Li gave a most interesting explanation of the Tiananmen
                    Incident. Li said that China had 40 years of uninterrupted peace since the
                    communists took over in 1949, so they had no water cannon or rubber bullets to
                    deal in a non-lethal way with massive crowd control/unrest. (This was of course
                    a huge lie: millions died during the see Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural
                    Revolution saw over a decade of violence and upheaval.) Li continued his remarks
                    to the Japanese, assuring them that China was acquiring water cannon and rubber
                    bullets, so next time would be different. I interpreted Li's remarks as the
                    closest we would ever get to the Chinese government admitting they had made a
                    mistake, but of course that was not enough for President Bush, who was demanding
                    the Chinese apologize publicly before we would lift sanctions. I think the
                    French may have gotten the cold treatment as well, because the French were
                    particularly upset. Tiananmen occurred while they were celebrating the 200th
                    anniversary of the French Revolution, and the French gave political asylum to
                    many of the student leaders.</p>
                <p>Another noteworthy point was in those days, China really had little knowledge of
                    how the U.S. worked. Now with all the thousands of returning students from the
                    U.S., they have a lot more sophisticated view of us. But in those days, many of
                    the leaders, and many within the Chinese government, really believed that
                    somehow the U.S. was behind the student movement. And we could not convince them
                    otherwise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, but were you trying to analyze things, like
                        what was going on in the politburo? When one looks at 1979 in the Kremlin
                        and saw their actions in invading Afghanistan, was there a feeling that this
                        was something similar, a last stand of the old guard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Well, it certainly was an overreaction on the part of Deng Xiaoping, and we
                    didn't know whether or not the leadership would be able to maintain its rule,
                    because the people were certainly outraged. But the only thing we could do was
                    observe and see how things would play out. What we didn't know at the time was
                    that the moderates had completely lost out, and the hardliners were in firm
                    control. Deng was an aged leader, but there were many hardliners like Li Peng,
                    who were only in their 50s or 60s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there certain feelings of being let down among the
                        China hands? I felt this and I was long out of it after five years in
                        Yugoslavia. You know the Serbs are the sons of bitches that let me down by
                        how awful they were, and I will never feel the same. I was wondering how
                        this affected you.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>MOHR: Well, the Chinese people didn't let me down. The Chinese government was
                    less than ideal, and it was the government which had demonstrated the lengths it
                    was willing to go in order to retain power. It was a communist government. Mao
                    had put the people through decades of suffering, so no one should have been too
                    surprised. It's just that we didn't have relations with China during Mao's bouts
                    of political madness in the 1950s and 1960s, so no American was on the scene to
                    witness and record the events at that time. Furthermore, as I said, no one
                    believed China's rulers would actually shoot the students. This was a function
                    of our naivet�, our lack of understanding of Deng and the other leaders. In
                    hindsight it was clear, given the amount of suffering Deng had endured during
                    the Cultural Revolution and the weeks of humiliation the leadership suffered
                    while the students had control of downtown Beijing, especially during the
                    Gorbachev visit, that the leadership might feel it necessary to shoot so that no
                    one in the society would ever take to the streets again to oppose the
                    regime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feedback from your people in the consular
                        section about Chinese students in the United States? Were they ordered back,
                        or what was happening there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, in general the Chinese were smart enough to leave students in the U.S.
                    alone, and when they returned, they weren't hassled. At least, we never heard
                    any stories from the students in the U.S. or those returning to China that they
                    were being given a hard time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well when you left there were things in still sort of a
                        stand down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: The Chinese government started reengaging with us in the fall of 1989, and
                    the man responsible was Richard Nixon. He came out for a visit. I believe it was
                    in November. The day before he was to visit the embassy, he told Li Peng that he
                    was going to visit the embassy, which he understood was surrounded by armed
                    militia. He wanted the Chinese to withdraw the militia immediately. Now these
                    militia were put there after Tiananmen, supposedly for our safety, but they were
                    really there to hassle us. They were young and untrained. Often they would point
                    their rifles as us. Presumably, the rifles weren't loaded, but it was still
                    creepy. Ambassador Lilly asked the White House to protest, but for whatever
                    reason, no one did. However Nixon did, and since Nixon had met with Mao in 1972
                    and had normalized relations, he had tremendous status. So Li Peng had to grant
                    his request. The militia was removed, and shortly after Nixon returned home, the
                    Chinese started reengaging with us. By the time I left, I think it was May 1990,
                    relations had improved somewhat. But as they say, when things hit rock bottom,
                    they have no place to go but up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well there was quite a controversial visit probably early
                        on, was it Scowcroft?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>MOHR: Ah, yes, the Scowcroft visit. He was head of the NSC, and Bush sent him to
                    China, I think it was around the time of their national day, in October 1989, to
                    try and see if relations could resume. Scowcroft made some routine toast to the
                    health of the leadership, but these were the people who still had the blood of
                    the students on their hands. We in the embassy were livid about Scowcroft, but
                    there was nothing we could do. Speaking of people who made us sick, there was
                    always Alexander Haig. What he did was far worse than what Scowcroft did. He
                    attended Chinese national day celebrations on October 1. The celebrations were
                    at Tiananmen Square, and that year, they celebrated the “victory” of the forces
                    of law and order over the students. And Haig sat there, watched the
                    “celebrations,” and saluted the leadership. It made us all at the embassy very
                    hostile to Haig. This of course was the same person who, seven years before,
                    thought it would be an excellent idea to negotiate with the Chinese to end U.S.
                    arms sales to Taiwan. I might add that shortly after Haig left office in 1982,
                    he wanted to broker an arms sale of the most sophisticated U.S. helicopters to
                    Taiwan. (It was refused.) So you can see that Haig was never one of my favorite
                    people.</p>

                <p>MOHR: Well I am sure his company is successful, and has many financially
                    rewarding ties to China. (Note: Haig passed away on February 20, 2010.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well that is in general what I am talking about; there has
                        always been this fascination almost adoration of China in America and in
                        Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: That is why I went into Chinese studies. I was fascinated by China. I
                    really like the Chinese people, although even now, they have a really terrible
                    form of government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find this sort of screwed up things sort of from
                        our policy view, I mean the fact that so many cabinet members wanted to come
                        and go to the Great Wall and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, I am glad I went into Chinese studies, but I try to remain objective.
                    These visitors, senior U.S. officials and otherwise, just seemed spellbound by
                    the Chinese. Now, I think there is a lot we can learn from China, especially in
                    the way they organize their society and their social values; for example, how
                    they react and cope with discomfort, suffering, personal setbacks, and their
                    tight family structure. It is true that this traditional kind of society is
                    breaking down as the Chinese become more industrialized and westernized. But I
                    believe that the way Chinese society is organized is worthy of our respect. On
                    the other hand, their governing system is just ridiculous. It is a communist
                    dictatorship. It lacks popular backing, the people have no interest at all in
                    communist ideology, and if the regime didn't produce great economic gains year
                    after year, they would be in political trouble.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well one of the things that interests me is the question,
                        does the writ of Beijing go out into the provinces or are there dukedoms out
                        there or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: In the early part of the 20th century, there were warlords or dukedoms, so
                    to speak. But not now. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) did a decade-long study
                    after Tiananmen as to why the Soviet Union collapsed in 1989. One of their
                    conclusions was that the Soviets let the provincial party structure atrophy, so
                    the CCP has spent a tremendous amount of time, energy and money to bolster
                    provincial and lower levels of the party, including having them study things
                    like management training. There is a wonderful book by Professor David Shambaugh
                    of George Washington University, China's Communist Party: Atrophy and
                    Adaptation, which documents all this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find that communist ideology still permeated
                        the system, because I have talked to people who served in Poland who said by
                        the time martial law was declared there may have been three or perhaps four
                        communists in the whole country. Was that going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: After the Tiananmen Incident, in a country of one billion people, there
                    were perhaps three or four who still believed in communism. Actually, no one
                    believes in communist ideology any more. But party leaders certainly believe in
                    the CCP as the only organization capable of governing a country the size of
                    Europe. From an ideological point of view, all Mao's campaigns turned people
                    off, and the Tiananmen Incident sealed it. People believe in the opportunity to
                    get rich, and the party has been successful to date in delivering an improvement
                    in the people's economic well-being, year after year. So long as the party
                    accomplishes this goal, the people will allow themselves to be governed by the

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Ideology was pretty much gone by 1988 as well, but as I noted, the
                    Tiananmen Incident really completed the people's dislike of the Chinese
                    Communist Party and its ideology.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I don't really know. The party certainly gives courses in Chinese-style
                    Marxism. Current party chief (and president) Hu Jintao was head of the party
                    school for 10 years, in the 1990s, so courses in Marxist thinking are still
                    being given. But basically, no one really believes in them. I think Hu believes
                    Marxist thinking is useful, but he is one of the few.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: The appeal in China is long gone. In the early 1990s, Deng Xiaoping said it
                    is glorious to be rich. That is now the people's anthem. It is sort of like 19th

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I went back to be deputy director of the China desk. I felt that in the
                    aftermath of Tiananmen, the China desk just didn't support the people in the
                    field to the degree I felt they should. For example, when people inquired about
                    their personnel assignments, often there was no response from Washington for
                    days or weeks. So, I wanted to be in the Department and support the troops in
                    the field, so to speak. Ambassador Lilly told me to take the job as deputy
                    director of the Korea desk. He said there were sensitive issues going on with
                    North Korea's nuclear program, and if I took the job on the Korea desk, chances
                    were I would be promoted. He said all I could do on the China desk was keep the
                    relationship from collapsing, and unfortunately, promotions are usually geared
                    to something positive happening, not from preventing something from getting
                    worse. Lilly proved to be correct. In the two years following, while I was on
                    the China desk, no one there got promoted, but people on the Korea desk did.
                    However, I was comfortable with my decision. I made sure that any inquiry from
                    the embassy was answered within 24 hours, even if it was only an interim reply
                    stating the reasons why a definite reply could not be made.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, but let's talk a little more about the year after
                        Tiananmen, from 1989-1990. Let me ask something. I know how important the
                        foreign service national staff is in so many countries. Frankly this is
                        where your continuity comes from. I know in Yugoslavia these were people who
                        had been around and could say we have done that before and they have the
                        connections.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I agree. The foreign service nationals (FSNs) provide the continuity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How important let's say prior to Tiananmen were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Well unfortunately China, being a communist country and somewhat of an
                    adversary, was different. No Chinese FSNs were allowed in the political section.
                    The FSNs in the embassy worked only in the non-classified sections, helping out
                    in consular and administrative work. The only FSN I do remember was in the
                    administrative section, doing travel. We later found out that he was a senior
                    official in the ministry of state security, which wasn't a surprise. Because of
                    his position, he could get tickets on any plane flights, or if the planes were
                    full, he could bump Chinese people and get our people seats. Needless to say,
                    this was invaluable during times of Congressional visits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling that an awful lot of our work is not
                        secretive, and what you want to do is say how do you think this will play or
                        something like that? Was there any thought of let's get somebody whether
                        they are high ranking or not so we can use them to play the system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Not in political or economic work. Our phones were bugged, our phones at
                    home were also bugged. The technology was fairly primitive at the time. Often,
                    when you picked up your phone, you would hear a loud click as their tape
                    recorder went on. China was just too closed a society at that time. The best
                    source of information, outside of our Chinese contacts, when they were talking
                    to us, was U.S. journalists. They often spoke Chinese, and had excellent
                    contacts among the Chinese students at the various universities, including
                    foreign students at the Chinese universities. I remember particularly a group of
                    Hungarian students were particularly helpful, as were a few American
                    students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your own internal political section?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>MOHR: My job was deputy director of the political section, and also chief of the
                    external section. So I was responsible for reporting on China's foreign policy.
                    Because of the Gorbachev visit, I was very busy devoting all my time to that.
                    China's internal political scene had been quiet for several years, so internal
                    reporting was not a priority, and those doing it really didn't have good
                    contacts, and almost none among the Chinese academic community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the other embassies, the British?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: The British, Japanese, and others were all taken by surprise by Tiananmen.
                    As we said, the ones with the best contacts on the scene were the American
                    journalists, particularly Dan Southerland of the Washington Post, David
                    Schweisberg of UPI, and Mike Chinoy of CNN. It also didn't hurt that David and
                    Mike were personal friends of mine. I am mentioned several times in Mike
                    Chinoy's book, China Live.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you all sort of get together pretty often and see what
                        the hell was going on, or were things going in a way rather calmly and so
                        there wasn't much concern over what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Before Tiananmen, things usually proceeded rather calmly. But the Fang
                    Lizhi incident during Bush's visit of February 1989 stirred things up, and after
                    Hu Yaobang died in April, all hell broke loose. We began getting together to
                    talk on a daily basis. Then martial law was declared, and Gorbachev came, and it
                    got even more hectic.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After it was over did it have any lasting effect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Gorbachev's visit?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: No, nobody cared in China at the time. The regime was too busy trying to
                    maintain stability. As I mentioned, it probably added to Deng Xiaoping's
                    motivation to use lethal force against the students. In subsequent years,
                    though, the Chinese and the Russians seem to have put most of their differences
                    behind them, so perhaps Gorbachev's visit was indeed significant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You previously mentioned Congressman Steven Solarz, whom I
                        have interviewed, by the way. China has always been a place that seems to
                        attract congressmen; China seems to appeal to Americans. It is a drawing
                        card; the celestial kingdom and all that.</hi>

                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>MOHR: So true.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find these Congressional trips to China? Were
                        they fairly brief?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: In the year before Tiananmen, they were fairly frequent. I believe they had
                    value. Contact between members of Congress and the Chinese government are
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did they seem to come back sort of impressed by the
                        beauty? The Chinese can put on a good show. Did you feel these visits were
                        in a way almost counterproductive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: No, not really. The Chinese know how to put on a good show, and make a
                    favorable impression. One thing about the conservatives used to irritate me.
                    They would speak critically of China to us, for example criticizing the
                    administration for not putting enough pressure on the Chinese to have a more
                    even playing field with regard to bilateral trade (we always had a big trade
                    deficit with China), but then when they were with the Chinese, all they would
                    say is, “Thank you for this delicious tea.” In other words, they were reluctant
                    to criticize the Chinese to their faces. Solarz was a bit different in that he
                    was like a knowledge sponge. He was very serious, and was relentless about
                    asking questions. He clearly learned something from his visits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a unique case.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Almost too much so. I recall one luncheon with a Chinese official on Tibet.
                    Solarz asked so many rapid-fire questions that the official didn't have time to
                    eat. His aides had to feed him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I have talked to people about what Solarz did in
                        Africa. He would go and he would have a huge schedule.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Morning, noon, and evening. He would go until he was exhausted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Returning to the aftermath of Tiananmen, were Chinese
                        students still going to the States?</hi>

                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>MOHR: I didn't work in the visa section, but I assume the Chinese government
                    still allowed students to go to the U.S. It made sense; if there were any
                    dissidents, better they should go abroad, where they didn't have any contact
                    with the Chinese people. Also, we had no reports of any returning students being
                    hassled. This is one thing you've got to give the Chinese credit for. In this
                    area, they were being intelligent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get anything about the Chinese students maybe
                        going to America and getting infected by Americanisms and coming back and

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: No, nothing of the sort. The Chinese students may have been “infected” by a
                    dose of democracy while in the U.S., but they also had seen what happened to
                    their fellow students during Tiananmen. It had the desired chilling effect.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: They had a difficult time in the immediate days following Tiananmen, and
                    were evacuated. So in subsequent months, they weren't there. They were
                    evacuated. When things calmed down, the families returned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I may have asked this question before, but I will ask it
                        again. Were we looking for control strings within the Chinese apparatus, for
                        autonomous activities in the provinces, or was everything pretty much in
                        Beijing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I was just totally focused on the central political forces in Beijing.
                    Outside of Beijing, I think the worst protests were in Shanghai, but they were
                    managed without resorting to lethal force. So it didn't seem like there were any
                    serious problems throughout the country. China is almost the size of Europe, so
                    it is a pretty big place. The real problems were in the upper echelons of
                    leadership of the communist party, not in the regional apparatus.</p>

                        to shoot its own people in a crowd, that often is the indicator that things
                        are going down. In a way Iran looks like the fundamentalist regime might be
                        in its final days. China seems to be one of the few countries that has been
                        able to get away with this.</hi>

                <p>MOHR: Again, I would refer you to Shambaugh's work on this subject. It describes
                    how after Tiananmen the CCP studied, for over 10 years, every socialist and
                    other kind of long-standing political party, including the Soviet Union and
                    Singapore, and analyzed all the good points and bad points. Then it took a look
                    at what it felt were the weaknesses within its own system, and drew up a plan to
                    right the wrongs. It seems to have worked. Many regime critics outside of China
                    predicted the demise of the CCP after Tiananmen. But they're still there.</p>

                    of the political system, but nobody, including probably most of the leaders,
                    believes in the ideology. However, they all believe that the CCP is the only
                    institution that can govern China. An interesting thing to note is that there
                    are over 70 million people in the Chinese Communist Party. So the CCP is bigger
                    than most countries.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But were you seeing even before Tiananmen a diminution of
                        sort of the ideological explanation of things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I think by the time Mao died in 1976 there was great relief, and a
                    diminution of ideological fervor. Mao and his constant political movements gave
                    ideological fervor a bad name. When Deng started to institute his pragmatic
                    economic reforms a few years later, the Chinese people breathed a collective
                    sigh of relief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then let's pick up this discussion from the time you
                        left China. When exactly did you depart?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: In May 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I took the job as deputy director of the China desk. I wanted to support
                    our people in China in any way I could, and I wanted to be a part of helping to
                    prevent the bilateral relationship from crashing through the floor. If that
                    happened, I felt it might take generations to get it back on track. One of the
                    reasons, as I mentioned previously, for going to the China desk is that I felt
                    the personnel system had not been as responsive as it could have been to the
                    desires of our people in the field.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk about first about the personnel system,
                        the personnel in broad administrative terms, what was the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I don't really know. Perhaps the China desk was just exhausted from the
                    entire Tiananmen business, and the people there just didn't have the energy to
                    put pressure on personnel to be more responsive to requests from the embassy. In
                    those days, the embassy would send in daily cables called O-Is, which stood for
                    official-informal communications. They involved the nitty-gritty administrative
                    stuff, including personnel issues. We would send in questions or requests in the
                    O-Is, and often many of our queries would go unanswered. I vowed that when I
                    returned to the desk, every issue raised in an O-I would have a response, even
                    if it was an interim response, within 24 hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about the communications, I represent an earlier
                        era where we used quill pens, and clipper ships. How did it work when you
                        were there? The internet, was that up and running by that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: This was 1989. There were no cell phones, there was no internet. There were
                    just telegrams, like the O-Is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would an O-I work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: It was a daily cable to the Department, and it involved administrative
                    matters. But it also included substantive matters. For example, we would comment
                    on policy or on requests from the Department to engage the Chinese on some issue
                    or other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would these action messages be screened by the DCM or
                        something to make sure you weren't wasting time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: The screening should have been done by the China desk at State, but they
                    didn't do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were on the China desk for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>MOHR: For two years, from 1990-1992. As I mentioned, after the Tiananmen
                    incident, the U.S. imposed a set of sanctions against China. All military
                    cooperation ceased, and China's leaders were barred from visiting the United
                    States. The Congress, the media, and public opinion were all critical of this
                    policy. They felt we should be doing more to punish China for shooting the
                    students, especially in the economic area.</p>
                <p>A consensus therefore built up to abolish most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status
                    with China. If MFN were taken away from China, Chinese goods into the United
                    States would be taxed at least at double the going rate. If that were to happen,
                    China's trade with the U.S. would be destroyed. As trade with the U.S. was the
                    engine of China's economy, the damage to China would be considerable, and this
                    would probably have set back bilateral relations for decades. Thus, the task of
                    the China desk post-Tiananmen was to preserve MFN for China. President Bush
                    actually told the State Department directly that the China desk was to focus on
                    preserving MFN for China. The basic threat came from Congress. There was a
                    majority on the Hill to take MFN away. Our goal was to find 34 opposing votes in
                    the Senate, enough to sustain a Presidential veto when the legislation passed to
                    remove MFN from China. .</p>
                <p>Our task was formidable. Both houses passed the legislation, and after much
                    lobbying we succeeded in sustaining the Presidential veto by one vote; I repeat,
                    one vote. It was a turning point in the history of the relationship, and I don't
                    think either political scientists or historians have appreciated this event. If
                    the vote had gone the other way, we estimated that 10 million jobs would be lost
                    in southern China alone within 3 months of the removal of MFN. China would have
                    suffered severe long-term economic damage. Those within China who never wanted
                    to normalize with the U.S. would have been vindicated. They would have argued
                    that the U.S. never wanted to see China strong and prosperous, that we always
                    wanted to keep China down. In that case, these persons in China would have been
                    put in charge of the bilateral relationship, and China, just like in the 1950s
                    and 1960s, would have taken a posture of regarding the U.S. as an enemy, allying
                    with nations with similar views. Just imagine the problems today if China were
                    supporting Al-Qaeda, or if China were allowing Al-Qaeda bases on its territory
                    to train. It's one thing to invade Iraq, but invading China would have been out
                    of the question. Fortunately, nothing like that ever happened, because we won
                    the battle to preserve MFN for China by one vote. I was the head of the task
                    force that accomplished this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, how did you bring this about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>MOHR: Basic lobbying. Unfortunately, U.S. business interests refused to support
                    us, even though we were fighting for their interests in trade with China. We're
                    talking about billions and billions of dollars in trade here. Nevertheless, they
                    were afraid to draw the anger of Congress, and the public. The basic argument
                    against continuing MFN ran something like this: China still has the red blood of
                    the students on its hands, but all the Bush administration cares about is the
                    green of money. So U.S. business was afraid, and would not help us. We were left
                    to our own devices. We drew up our arguments for preserving MFN, and would just
                    call or meet with Congressional staff and the leaders of the relevant committees
                    to press our case.</p>
                <p>We coordinated our efforts with the Bureau of Congressional Affairs, and
                    identified about 40 Senators who might vote in favor of MFN. Then we just went
                    to work. Hours and hours of lobbying, that's what did it. Nancy Pelosi was in
                    her first term in Congress, and she ran with this issue. She said she had a
                    moral imperative to take MFN away from China. I spoke to her personally several
                    times. I never could convince her, but it was a given that the House would vote
                    to take away MFN. We concentrated on the Senate, trying to get the 34 votes we
                    needed there to sustain a Presidential veto. I will never forget the day the
                    vote was taken. I got a call from Pelosi's chief staffer who said, “You are
                    probably celebrating right now. (Actually, we were). You shouldn't because we
                    got a late start, so now we have a strategy in place from this very moment. We
                    are starting today. If I were you I wouldn't celebrate too much because next
                    year we are going to bring you down, and we are going to take away this odious
                    Most Favored Nation status.” Fortunately, his words proved hollow: in the next
                    year, they lost by 23 votes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but by then things had changed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, but that was a year later. On the day, the staffer really scared me. I
                    mean you work so hard to accomplish this goal, and after just one phone call,
                    you think you are going to have a tougher fight on your hands over the next
                    year, and this time you might lose. After all, on that day, we only won by one
                    vote. It's like doing some huge research paper for school, then your computer
                    eats it, and you have to start all over again. It really was an awful
                    feeling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So essentially this is a three-cornered game or something.
                        The House people were encouraging the Senate to block it. It is the Senate
                        that decides this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: The Senate decides when the president vetoes a bill. The House and Senate
                    first passed a bill to remove MFN from China. Then the President vetoed the
                    bill, and the Senate, which of course had passed the bill, now had the
                    opportunity to override the presidential veto. But they needed a two-thirds
                    majority to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said Pelosi led the fight from the House. She is from
                        San Francisco, isn't she?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>MOHR: Yes she is, and that is one of the reasons she said she had to get
                    involved, because so many of her constituents are Chinese. But I think this was
                    an excuse. She was in her first term, and this issue gave her national exposure.
                    It launched her leadership career. I would talk to her, she would call me
                    personally and we would argue. I told her I didn't think she was right. I didn't
                    go so far as to say that I questioned her integrity, but I don't think she
                    really cared about the issue. I think she cared about getting her name in the
                    newspaper on a daily basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Senate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Well, Jesse Helms was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
                    (SFRC). Lucky us. I mean, here we have a Republican president, with a Republican
                    majority in the Senate. The president is passionately in favor of preserving MFN
                    for China, but there is no way in hell that he can convince a majority of his
                    own party in the Senate from voting to take MFN away from China. Ironic, isn't
                    it? And it wasn't as if we had this isolated or irrational policy. Every other
                    major country in the world, the Europeans, the Japanese, the Australians, etc.
                    had sanctions on China because of Tiananmen, but none, I repeat none, had any
                    trade sanctions. So our policy was in keeping, so to speak, within international
                    norms. Of course Congress didn't care about what anyone else in the world was
                    doing. All it cared about was punishing the Chinese leadership for what it did
                    at Tiananmen. But by taking MFN away, it would be punishing the Chinese people
                    far more than the leadership, and the people had been the victims. Another irony
                    was that this was one of the few instances where the Republican leadership in
                    Congress would be taking an act that would hurt U.S. business interests as well,
                    but emotions were just too high. Members of Congress had been so provoked by
                    those T.V. images during Tiananmen that they didn't care.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>There is another point I would like to make. Not only did we not have the support
                    of U.S. business in the MFN fight, we didn't have the support of Secretary of
                    State James Baker either. At the time, Baker had presidential ambitions. I think
                    he felt, assuming that Bush would win again in 1992, that he could be a
                    presidential candidate for the Republicans in 1996. I drafted three separate
                    speeches for Baker to give supporting MFN for China. They always were returned
                    to me with something written on the top to the effect of, “Will not deliver.”
                    The third time this happened, I went to one of Baker's staffers and asked why
                    the secretary would not deliver the speech. He replied, “Mark, you are so na�ve.
                    The secretary does not do losers.” I asked him to explain, and he said MFN would
                    be taken away from China, and the secretary did not want to back a losing cause.
                    I got really mad, and said that so long as Baker took his paycheck from the
                    Treasury, he was secretary of state, and he had a duty to act like one. The
                    staffer just chuckled. The real reason for Baker's inaction was that he didn't
                    want to anger Congress, and bring the media down on his head, in defending MFN
                    for China. This, he felt, would damage his chances to run for president after
                    Bush's (assumed) second term. I often wondered why the President ordered the
                    China desk to defend MFN, but didn't order his secretary of state to do
                    likewise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course this happens again and again with such people.
                        There is nothing like presidential ambitions to screw things up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Right, secretaries of state shouldn't have presidential ambitions, except
                    if you have the abilities of a Thomas Jefferson. So it was one of the things
                    that really disappointed me. Baker wouldn't support us. The U.S. business
                    community wouldn't support us. But we won anyway, and MFN—and the bilateral
                    relationship—was preserved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the embassy of China? How did it work from your

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: The embassy couldn't help. They were considered poison, any Chinese
                    government official was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't they have any clout or influence on the Hill?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>MOHR: Then? No, they were just members of a country that was universally reviled.
                    They were treated like lepers. Also, at that time, they didn't have any office
                    in their embassy that dealt specifically with Congress. It was not until 1994
                    that they established a unit in their embassy to deal with the Hill. Although
                    their first diplomatic office was set up in 1972, and an embassy in 1979, the
                    Chinese were so ignorant of our political system that they thought, just as in
                    China, the legislature in the U.S. was just a rubber stamp, and the executive
                    was all that mattered. Although we constantly tried to persuade them of the
                    importance of Congress, they wouldn't listen, that is, until 1994.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This has always been a problem with embassies. When people
                        first arrive they think that their main contact point is the State
                        Department. The main contact point should be the media and Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: And the NSC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I recall interviews that I have had revealing that
                        the difference between Pakistan and India was that the Indian embassy would
                        only come to somebody of comparable rank, maybe an assistant secretary,
                        whereas the Pakistanis would get right down to the lowliest desk officer and
                        cultivate that person. It showed, because the Indians were very hyped on
                        protocol, and that is not what you want. You have got to reach out all over
                        the place. Who was the assistant secretary for East Asia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: In 1990, it was Richard Solomon. He knew Baker's opinion concerning the
                    issue, so he focused his attention on Cambodia. Ironically, Solomon had a Ph.D.
                    in Chinese studies. Have you talked to Solomon?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes I have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: What did he say? Well, it will be interesting to read what he said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can pick it up on the internet. My interview with him
                        is on the internet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Where on the internet?</p>

                        will be there. Now as I did those interviews, the earlier ones, they were
                        not obviously as detailed. Perhaps I didn't get into his views on MFN. Maybe
                        I didn't get to this interesting point.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>MOHR: I agree it will be interesting, because I am sure he was aware that the
                    President had given it top priority, but he spent the majority of his time on
                    Cambodian issues. His principal deputy assistant secretary, Desaix Anderson, on
                    the other hand, was very supportive of our efforts to maintain MFN for
                    China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much to do with the White House and the
                        NSC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Not me personally. Kent Wiedemann, who was my boss, the office director for
                    Chinese affairs, had daily contact with his NSC counterpart, Doug Paal. They
                    spoke every day over the phone, usually from about 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., so
                    there was daily contact between the desk and the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, could the president do things? Was he on the phone
                        to the Congress, particularly the Senate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I would have to assume that the President called many senators and lobbied
                    personally. I know for a fact that he was engaged heavily on this issue. Being a
                    former head of the U.S. liaison office in China, President Bush had a good
                    background and a good feel for the bilateral relationship. He really cared. It's
                    funny, because in a way, the President was the real head of the China desk. We
                    on the desk really didn't have much support within the building, but in the end
                    it didn't matter, because we had the support of the President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Chinese understanding of the problem and
                        repairing things; were they cooperating on trying to show that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Well they didn't shoot anybody else. So I guess that was a positive. The
                    way the Chinese saw it, they didn't do anything wrong. There had been a
                    challenge to their regime, and they beat it back. They felt it was no one else's
                    business. They were fairly outraged that we decided they had done something
                    wrong and imposed sanctions on them. The President publicly called for them to
                    apologize. That was never going to happen. So we maintained our sanctions, and
                    they continued to criticize us and refuse to do business with the U. S.
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you must have made a trip or two to China didn't
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: No, there was no point. Not in the years following Tiananmen. It was a
                    stalemate, and I was too busy trying to preserve MFN for China. It was a full
                    time lobbying job.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you did that for two years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, there was agreement within the U.S. government that if we could
                    preserve MFN, the Chinese would see that, despite the sanctions, we meant them
                    no real long-term harm, that we valued the bilateral relationship and wished to
                    maintain it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Taiwanese trying to screw up the works?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Not that I recall. I think the Taiwanese were afraid that a rupture in
                    relations between the U.S. and the PRC would only create more tension in the
                    Taiwan Strait and in the long run harm them as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well if you had horrible relations it could mean that
                        China might use Taiwan as an external enemy or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: But you need to recall that in 1987, there was a big breakthrough between
                    China and Taiwan. China agreed to allow Taiwanese to visit the mainland for the
                    first time, and the government on Taiwan agreed to let their people go visit. So
                    China and Taiwan had begun a process of opening up, and neither side wanted
                    Tiananmen to affect that. As a matter of fact, while tourism from Western
                    countries dropped over 90 percent in the year following Tiananmen, Taiwanese
                    tourism continued unabated. I talked to some Taiwanese tourists, and they
                    confirmed to me that they were not afraid one bit. In their opinion, Tiananmen
                    had nothing to do with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about say the British and all that? Did we have much
                        contact, did you have contact with the other embassies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Well as I said, the British were among the few serious China watchers in
                    the diplomatic community, but we didn't have a lot of contact with them.
                    However, we would occasionally discuss what we thought was going on in China
                    with them, the Japanese, and the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were back in Washington did you ever talk to the
                        Russians, I guess they would be the Soviets still, or the British?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>MOHR: No, we were just too busy. We put in over 12 hours a day working on MFN and
                    other issues in the bilateral relationship. Occasionally, foreign embassies
                    would come in to ask about the state of U.S.-China relations, but that was about
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, at the level of the Secretary, there was little
                        contact.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, as I said, Baker just didn't want to get involved. But fortunately for
                    us, and for the state of the bilateral relationship, the President did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how about the second year you were there. What was
                        that like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: It got a little easier. As I said, on the first MFN vote, we only won by
                    one vote. By the time of the second MFN vote, we garnered almost a majority, and
                    we only needed one-third plus one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, after two years, were there any developments other
                        than the MFN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: That was pretty much it. The second year was much easier, much less stress.
                    Then, I needed to focus on my next assignment. Traditionally, the deputy
                    director of the China desk is an FSO-1, a rank equivalent to a full colonel in
                    the military. The pattern usually was that the deputy director, on next
                    assignment, goes to Beijing to be the political counselor. This is a senior
                    foreign service job, and after two to three years in the job, the incumbent
                    always had been promoted into the senior foreign service. The only problem was
                    that I was exhausted. Two years working on the INF treaty, the last year working
                    16 hour days; two years in China watching things blow up and people getting
                    shot; two years in Washington worrying day and night about MFN. I needed a rest,
                    and being political counselor in Beijing, especially during those times, was a
                    very stressful position. I thought about it for a long time, and instead of
                    making a move to advance my career, I made a move to shore up my mental health.
                    I did not apply for the job of political counselor in Beijing. Instead, I chose
                    the position of U.S. consul in Brisbane, Australia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q I want to interrupt to ask if you felt those years of
                        stress had an effect on your marriage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Good point, because it ended my marriage. My wife really resented all the
                    hours I put in working on the INF Treaty. Then when I returned from China after
                    living there by myself, my wife said that she wanted a divorce. So those years
                    of stress and separation definitely played a role in my marriage ending in
                    divorce, but there was also the fact that we had really grown apart. It
                    happens.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>So, I was divorced by the time I needed to think about my next assignment. Being
                    divorced played a role in my decision to go to Brisbane rather than Beijing. In
                    Beijing, there was still the “non-fraternization” rule. You were not allowed,
                    for security reasons, to be romantically involved with a Chinese woman. In
                    Australia, on the other hand, I could date whoever I wanted. So, mainly to get a
                    break from the stress, but also possibly to develop another relationship, I
                    chose to go to Brisbane. I thereby gave up on the dream of becoming an
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to say that obviously I have interviewed many
                        people. I find myself less and less impressed by somebody who became an
                        ambassador. OK, Whoop de doo. I mean it is all right, but it is not the be
                        all and end all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Well in my own view, the timing on the road to career advancement was all
                    wrong. I just needed a rest. Had I been in the senior foreign service, there
                    were all sorts of relatively relaxed assignments where you could in fact have a
                    rest, such as ambassador-in-residence. Treatment for burn-out is recognized at
                    that level. But not at the level I was, just below that of the senior foreign
                    service. Another factor, which I was unaware of at the time, was that I was in
                    poor physical shape. When I met my current wife Ruth, a medical doctor, in 1997,
                    she commented on signs of my exhaustion. She said I was out of shape from no
                    exercise, and my breathing after a little bit of exertion was shallow and rapid.
                    In her medical opinion, if I had continued in stressful jobs, I could have died
                    in a few years. So, especially given that consideration, although it was in
                    hindsight, I definitely made the right decision to go to Brisbane in 1992. I was
                    there for three years, returned to the Department in 1995, got another job, and
                    was told one year later, in 1996, that I did not make the promotion list based
                    on my time in Brisbane. Therefore I would have to leave the foreign service in
                    1997. But I believe the decision I made in 1992, when leaving the China desk,
                    was the correct one, even without the knowledge of the health issue. I was
                    really tired, and I just wanted to have a tour that was fun. And the tour in
                    Brisbane surpassed my expectations. It was thoroughly enjoyable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, shall we call it off now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: All right. We can talk about my Brisbane tour at the start of our next
                    session.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is 27 January 2010 with Mark Mohr. Mark we are off
                        to Australia. What are the dates you served there in Australia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>MOHR: Let's see, from the summer of 1992 to the summer of 1995. It was a
                    three-year tour. There was very little not to like. I was the boss for the first
                    time in my professional life. When I wanted something done, it got done. No
                    waiting. I decided on what I wanted to report, wrote it up, edited it, approved
                    it, and sent it out. Again, no waiting. I had a fabulous residence, with a huge
                    lawn and a swimming pool. There were even outdoor bathrooms, so if I gave a
                    party, the guests never had to enter the house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Australia and New Zealand, were these considered to be
                        outside the real game in East Asia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Oh, most definitely. They certainly weren't considered career-enhancing
                    assignments. I knew full well when I went to Brisbane that I would not get
                    promoted into the senior foreign service. I was offered a job in 1992 as East
                    Asian advisor in the office of the undersecretary for political affairs. This
                    probably would have gotten me promoted into the senior foreign service. But
                    again, in that job, you worked until 8 or 9 p.m. every night. I turned that down
                    too. I truly needed a rest. My thinking was: better to go to Brisbane and not
                    get promoted than to have a nervous breakdown. I just knew I wouldn't do well as
                    a patient at St. Elizabeth's, D.C.'s local mental hospital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk about Brisbane.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: OK. I had been dealing with the Chinese communists, both in Beijing and
                    Washington, for four years. It was quite stressful. It was an adversarial
                    relationship. We were not friends. So going to Australia, to an allied nation,
                    was like entering a different world. It took me months to adjust to the fact,
                    much like Sally Fields accepting the academy award, that the people I met
                    “really liked me. They really liked me.” More accurately, they genuinely liked
                    Americans. And even though it was the early 1990s, they had received a big
                    psychic shock during World War II. The Japanese had successfully occupied Papua
                    New Guinea. They were very close to invading Australia. Imagine how we would
                    have felt if the Japanese had conquered British Columbia, in Canada. There was
                    the real possibility that Australia, a continent, would be invaded by the
                    Japanese. In the event, the Australians felt that America was responsible for
                    saving them, and unlike the French, they were more than willing to say thank
                    you. And since I was the only official U.S. representative in Queensland, the
                    province of which Brisbane is the capital, the people there felt obligated to be
                    nice to me to show their gratitude. It was wonderful.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was working at the consulate like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>MOHR: It was small, a consulate, not a consulate-general. I was the only
                    American, and I had five foreign service nationals (FSNs) working for me. Three
                    did consular work, one was my administrative assistant, and one was the
                    receptionist/chauffeur. That was Norman. He was a British immigrant. So I had a
                    British chauffeur, very classy. The other FSNs were all female. They all were
                    competent, and supported each other. It was the first time I had an office with
                    no personnel problems. I was fortunate in that regard. Moreover at the time
                    Brisbane, and the entire province of Queensland as well, was booming
                    economically. As Australia is relatively close to Indonesia and Singapore,
                    American companies were moving to Brisbane as their southeast Asian
                    headquarters. It was safer, the educational system was better, and everyone
                    spoke English. So my reporting was mostly on economic and commercial matters,
                    although I did the occasional political piece. Reporting was not too stressful.
                    I averaged one cable per week. I was not under any illusion that Washington was
                    waiting with baited breath for my reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, let's talk about the city of Brisbane a bit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: The first thing you notice is the weather. It is close to perfect.
                    Queensland is known in Australia as the sunshine state. It says so on their
                    license plates. About ten months of the year, the high is 85 and the low 65.
                    Then in the summer months, January and February, it is a bit hotter. Weather has
                    a direct effect on one's disposition, so the attitude of most people was sunny
                    as well. They are serious about their work, but also serious about their leisure
                    time, be it planning for what to do on weekends, or how to spend their
                    vacations. One funny thing is that on the unusual cloudy day, people start
                    mumbling discontentedly. If there is a second cloudy day, they start grumbling.
                    In the rare event of a third cloudy day, they are downright unhappy. It is as if
                    they feel they had a constitutional right to wake up in the morning and see
                    sunshine. For most of the year, they did. I soon acquired a girlfriend who was a
                    former Australian model and a Miss Queensland. She was Italian-Australian, with
                    blond hair and green eyes. She was also quite social and verbal. I was on the
                    top of the society. I was the American consul representing the country who had
                    saved them from the Japanese during WWII. I hobnobbed with the elites of
                    Brisbane society. People kept trying to think of ways of doing things for me. As
                    they say in the McDonalds' commercials, I was “lovin' it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did the battle of the Coral Sea syndrome die down
                        while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>MOHR: No, not at all. They observed every battle. I was required to attend every
                    celebration of every anniversary of every WWII battle. In the 1990s, most such
                    anniversaries were the 50th year, so they were rather big and important. One
                    advantage was I got to know the premier, Wayne Goss, fairly well. He was from
                    the labor party, but was progressive labor. That is to say, he believed that the
                    best the government could do for a worker was not to provide welfare, but a job.
                    His chief of staff was Kevin Rudd, who later went on to be a prime minister of
                    Australia. Kevin was my friend at the time, and we would have lunch once or
                    twice a month. He was a former Australian foreign service officer, specializing
                    in China, so we had a lot in common.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our interests in Brisbane?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: It was mainly the growing American commercial presence, and also helping
                    out the Americans who had settled in the province after WWII. I remember that an
                    uncle of John Riggins, the Washington Redskins football star, was there.
                    Unfortunately, the consulate closed down for budgetary reasons after I left.
                    Consulate-General Sydney now covers Queensland. So I was the last U.S. consul
                    there. An historical footnote.</p>
                <p>The real story of the closing is an interesting one. I found it out from the DCM.
                    The stated reason, as noted above, was for budgetary reasons. It was a time of
                    cutbacks, but in reality Brisbane had escaped the list of post closings. State
                    was going to close one or two consulates in East Asia. Each post was asked to
                    submit a rationale for its remaining open. My rationale was that a consulate's
                    main function at that time was to provide service and opportunities to U.S.
                    businesses. U.S. companies were increasing their presence in Brisbane. AT&amp;T
                    had just come in. I had recently helped secure a quarter of a billion dollar
                    contract for a U.S. firm. There was a need for American citizen services, and
                    most of the U.S. citizens residing in Queensland were elderly, so traveling to
                    Sydney would be a real inconvenience for them. I found out from the DCM that my
                    rationale was accepted, and Brisbane initially was not on the list to be cut.
                    However, the number one consulate on the list to be cut was Sapporo in Japan.
                    The ambassador to Tokyo at the time was former vice president Walter Mondale.
                    Mondale called his friend, then Vice President Al Gore, and complained. Gore
                    called State, and told it that Sapporo was to remain open. In order to keep
                    Sapporo open, which was very expensive, State had to cut two consulates in East
                    Asia. So Brisbane and one consulate in Indonesia, Medan, was added to the list.
                    The incoming consul to Medan was just finishing one year of Indonesian language
                    training at the time. She was informed that her post was to be closed, and that
                    she had to get another assignment. Because I did not have equal or greater
                    political influence than a former vice president, my consulate was closed as
                    well. Another example of life being unfair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general in Sydney?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>MOHR: At the time, it was Greg Bujac. He was a bit unusual, in that he came out
                    of the division of security affairs (SY). He was a great guy, with great people
                    skills, and whenever I needed something from Sydney, he would provide it. I had
                    no doubt that he would be capable of covering Queensland as well, but it hurt
                    that we would be closed, and that five extremely loyal and hard-working
                    employees would be out of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you try to fight the decision?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: There was nothing I could do. To make matters worse, I was informed of the
                    closing in the following manner. The administrative counselor called, pointedly
                    noting that he was calling on behalf of the ambassador. He told me that the
                    decision had been made to close Brisbane, two years in the future. However, on
                    orders from the ambassador, I was not to tell my staff. I replied, “You can't be
                    serious.” He said, “No, I am perfectly serious. This is an order from the
                    ambassador.” I said, “You can tell the ambassador that I will not be obeying
                    this order. I felt it was unethical. “Correct me if I am wrong,” I said, “but
                    what you want to do is keep these people in ignorance so they will work here.
                    That is to say, it will be most convenient for you. No one will leave early, and
                    you won't be faced with the difficult situation of trying to get someone new to
                    work at a post that will be closing soon. So keep the staff in the dark, tell
                    them nothing, and you won't be inconvenienced. Then at the last minute, when it
                    will be really hard if not impossible for them to get another job, you will say,
                    'Oops sorry you are fired.' Well, I won't be a party to this. I am going to tell
                    my staff that the consulate is closing.”</p>
                <p>The administrative counselor said, “You realize what the consequences may be.” I
                    replied, “Yes, the ambassador could send me home. However, I don't care. This is
                    important to me. Throughout my career I have basically been treated decently by
                    my superiors. However, there were times when I was not. I said to myself that
                    when I am in a position of authority I am going to make sure the people who are
                    working for me are treated fairly. Now was the time to act on those principles.
                    He said, “I will talk to the ambassador.” The ambassador was Ed Perkins, who I
                    knew and liked. I felt he was a decent person. In the event, I was correct in my
                    judgment, as Perkins let me stay. It all worked out. I was right to tell the
                    staff, and the administrative counselor was wrong in his desire to keep them in
                    the dark. By telling the staff, I secured their loyalty. They were able to plan
                    their futures, and the earliest any staff member left was one week before the
                    consulate closed. The department did do one nice thing: it offered jobs to two
                    of my consular staff, in Sydney. One agreed, and one decided not to move.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is interesting because Ed Perkins essentially came
                        out of the personnel field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would have thought he would have had a particular
                        sympathy to the staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Interesting point. Perhaps the whole idea not to tell the staff originated
                    with the administrative counselor, and he just made up the stuff about the
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It may have been the admin counselor trying to make things
                        easier for himself. Good for you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, I am very proud of that, and Perkins did support me. My staff was all
                    Australian, and they were wonderful. They worked hard for me, and I owed it to
                    them to support them as best I could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk a bit about your time there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: As I said, I did mostly commercial reporting, with a bit of local politics
                    thrown in. The representatives of the major political parties were thrilled that
                    I was interested in their work, and always made time for me. My predecessor had
                    been a career consular officer, and she was not interested in political matters.
                    In addition, a big part of my responsibilities were representational. There was
                    a lot of public speaking, not just limited to military anniversaries. I was
                    asked to speak at many events. As I like to talk, this was not a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well were there any military considerations, from the
                        American military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Not in Brisbane. There were military anniversaries, and U.S. military
                    representatives would attend. One time I had the commander in chief of Pacific
                    forces (CINCPAC) visit for the 50th anniversary of the battle of the Coral Sea.
                    In protocol terms, I outranked him. If neither the ambassador nor the DCM were
                    present in Queensland, I was the representative of the president of the United
                    States. Therefore, I outranked anyone in the military. This was very cool, as my
                    personal rank was only equivalent to a colonel, but when CINCPAC, a four-star
                    general (actually in this case an admiral), came to Queensland, I outranked him.
                    In addition, we would have periodic visits from a U.S. nuclear submarine, which
                    would come up the Brisbane River. Lunch with the commander and a tour of the
                    submarine was a very coveted ticket. As I gave out the invitations, all of
                    Brisbane's top VIPs would lobby me to be invited. I also learned what the inside
                    of a nuclear submarine looked like. It is surprisingly small. Clearly, weapons
                    got priority over humans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you have any problem sort of equivalent to the
                        labor left wing being opposed to our bases, our listening bases?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>MOHR: No, not at all. Queensland is one of the most conservative parts of
                    Australia. There was some concern on the part of the Australian authorities
                    about repercussions amongst the groups of the former Yugoslavia, fighting each
                    other and protesting U.S. policy in that region. For instance, if we took an
                    action against the Serbs in the former Yugoslavia, there was concern that the
                    Serbian groups in Brisbane (who numbered over 30,000) might take some harmful
                    action against me or the Consulate. The police visited my office to assure me
                    that they were watching and protecting me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: But that was the late 1990s, wasn't it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I think they were still having troubles then, and

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, there were a lot of Serbs and Croats, even in Brisbane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did that play out at all...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Not in front of the American consulate. I think they might have squabbled
                    with each other, but it was never a concern of mine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then what happened to you? Did you retire then or

                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Well I had another year to go in my grade, after I finished my tour in
                    Brisbane in 1995. If I didn't get promoted, and a promotion was unlikely based
                    on my assignment in Brisbane, chances were that I would be involuntarily
                    retired. Since prospective employers were aware of the fact that I probably
                    wouldn't be in the Foreign Service for too much longer, I couldn't get a good
                    job, so I was detailed to the Pentagon in the office of foreign military rights.
                    This office was full of military lawyers and dealt with negotiating and amending
                    status of forces agreements, the legal rights of U.S. troops when in foreign

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They call them SOFAs, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: That's right, status of forces agreements, SOFAs. The head of the office,
                    Phil Barringer, was a man in his 80s. He had written the first U.S. SOFA
                    agreement, the NATO agreement, in 1952. I returned from Brisbane in the summer
                    of 1995. That fall, while working in the Pentagon, I received a phone call from
                    my personnel officer with the news that I had not been promoted. I would
                    therefore be selected out of the foreign service by the summer of 1996. That was
                    it. My career was over. Although I knew it was coming, since I made the decision
                    in 1992 to go to Brisbane rather than Beijing, it was still a blow, especially
                    in contrast to the life-style I had just left in Brisbane. In Brisbane, I was at
                    the top of society, socially mixing with the premier, all the top CEOs, etc. But
                    I knew even at the time that most of the prestige was derived from my position,
                    not from me personally. Now I was a minor functionary in a minor office at the
                    Pentagon, and in a few months, my career as a foreign service officer, the only
                    job identity I had ever known, would be over as well . Fortunately I had a
                    Chinese-American friend, Tai Kuo, who had been my tennis teacher in Taipei in
                    the early 1970s. Tai had received a full tennis scholarship to attend a small
                    college in Louisiana, and since I was then the vice-consul in charge of visas, I
                    had to rule on his application. His scholarship award by the U.S. college was
                    perfectly bona-fide. The problem was that Tai had not attended a regular
                    university in Taiwan, but a technical school. The U.S. had a requirement that
                    you had to take an English language test, I believe it was called TESOL, and get
                    a passing grade to demonstrate your English language capability to do college
                    work in America. But Taiwan had a requirement that you had to attend a regular
                    tertiary school in Taiwan to sit for the TESOL test, so he couldn't take it.
                    Therefore, Tai was in a bind, and he came to me with his problem. He needed the
                    U.S. visa official to waive his requirement for the TESOL test. Now, Tai could
                    speak English much better that most Taiwanese college applicants to the U.S.,
                    because he taught many Americans tennis, including most at the embassy. His
                    spoken English was ungrammatical, true, but he could speak and understand
                    English, as opposed to most of the others who were going to America, whose
                    reading ability far surpassed their spoken language skills. So I waived the
                    TESOL requirement for Tai, and gave him his visa. He struggled at first in
                    Louisiana, but finally got his college degree, so my decision proved correct.
                    More than that, he went into the Chinese restaurant business, and eventually
                    owned a string of restaurants. He became a millionaire.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>We lost contact in the 1970s and 1980s, but while I was in Brisbane he found me.
                    I received an e-mail from him. He somehow knew I might be retiring from the
                    foreign service and asked if I would be interested in forming a company, just
                    the two of us, to consult with the Chinese on political matters. Tai explained
                    that, at the time, the Chinese really didn't have many people who understood the
                    U.S. Deep down, many Chinese officials were afraid of U.S. officials, but being
                    Chinese, they would just pretend they were in control and brazen it out. Tai
                    explained that people were needed to explain to the Chinese what Americans were
                    really like, to explain their thought processes, and coach them on how to deal
                    with Americans. Basically, it was to explain to them that the U.S. really wasn't
                    the enemy, but sincerely wanted to work with China to advance the bilateral
                    relationship in a positive way. This sounded exactly like something I wanted to
                    do, so I eagerly agreed to go into partnership with Tai. We set up our company
                    in the fall of 1996, and Tai provided all the financing. He had contacts with a
                    Chinese friendship organization in Guangzhou (formerly Canton), so we went on
                    our first trip to China there, I think it was in November 1996. The friendship
                    organizations were quasi-official, and they made recommendations and wrote
                    policy papers for the government, so I knew we might be able to have some
                    influence. I enjoyed the several days I “lectured” to the friendship
                    organizations. I could speak frankly and bluntly to the Chinese in a way I never
                    could as a diplomat.</p>
                <p>I spoke basically about the 1982 communiqu� between the U.S. and China on arms
                    sales to Taiwan. By 1996, the Chinese felt they had been outsmarted by us. U.S.
                    arms sales to Taiwan were continuing. I told the Chinese, as I have explained
                    previously, that it was their fault the results were not as they had hoped. They
                    had not studied the political beliefs of Ronald Reagan carefully enough, they
                    believed only what Secretary of State Haig told them, and they had never taken
                    the time to speak to Reagan himself. They had only themselves to blame. I really
                    enjoyed giving it to them, so to speak, and recall they took copious notes and
                    asked many questions.</p>
                <p>I also talked to them about the way their leaders went to the United States and
                    just had a horrible press because they treated the U.S. media the way they
                    treated their own. I said it was clear Chinese leaders knew nothing about U.S.
                    society, and unless they learned, they would continue to have a lousy public
                    image in America. They asked how to go about this. I explained that before a
                    high leader was going to the U.S., there should be a practice session, or
                    sessions, with people playing the role of the U.S. press, asking the leader
                    pointed and difficult questions, the more difficult the better. I explained we
                    did this in the U.S. with our senior State Department officials before they
                    would be going to testify before Congress. We called these rehearsal sessions
                    “murder boards.” The Chinese heard this and were alarmed. I quickly explained no
                    one was killed in this process. It was just a name to refer to these rehearsals.
                    Then they understood.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>I was told by Tai several months later, after we returned, that the friendship
                    organization had written up my suggestion, had sent it to Beijing, and Beijing
                    had adopted the recommendation. It was the first recommendation to Beijing
                    submitted by the Guangzhou group to be adopted by Beijing, and they were all
                    thrilled. They wanted me to meet with them two or three times a year. So our
                    consultancy business had started out really well. But there soon arose one
                    problem. A friend at State told me, according to U.S. law, that if you were
                    going to advise a foreign government on how to deal with the U.S., you had to
                    register as a foreign agent with the Department of Justice (DOJ). I called DOJ
                    and found out that this was no ordinary application. You had to register with
                    the criminal division of the DOJ. This really bothered me. Friends at State said
                    it was no big deal. Kissinger and others, after all, were giving all sorts of
                    advice to foreign governments, so they were all registered in this way. But I
                    had a bad feeling. Tiananmen had occurred in 1989. It was now 1996. The Chinese
                    were still in bad odor with the USG, and I was not so fond of leading Chinese
                    officials myself. I could see the possibility where I might do something
                    inadvertently, and I certainly didn't want to be held criminally liable. Neither
                    Tai nor I were lawyers. I mulled over my feelings for several weeks, then fate
                    intervened.</p>
                <p>I received a phone call from Chuck Kartman. Chuck was then ambassador for North
                    Korean negotiations for the Clinton administration, and an old friend from
                    embassy Tokyo in the late 1970s. Chuck wanted me to join the North Korean
                    division of the Korean desk. I could work as a WAE (when actually employed),
                    which meant I could work half-time at State, and continue to receive my full
                    retirement benefits. You recall I had been in the Peace Corps in Korea, and was
                    certainly curious about North Korea. When Chuck told me my job would include
                    trips to North Korea, I agreed to go back to State. I informed Tai that I was
                    quitting our partnership. He was not happy, but he understood.</p>
                <p>Now a little background on U.S.-North Korean relations is in order. I started my
                    job on the Korea desk in the spring of 1997. In the late 1980s and early 1990s,
                    the U.S. had suspected that the North Koreans were starting a nuclear weapons
                    program. They had a nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, and we believed the North
                    Koreans were using the reactor to burn uranium. The spent fuel thus produced
                    contained plutonium, nuclear weapons-grade material. After much tension, we
                    concluded a bilateral agreement with the North Koreans in 1994, commonly
                    referred to as the Agreed Framework (AF). Under this agreement, North Korea
                    would freeze and eventually eliminate its nuclear weapons program. In return we
                    would provide it with two light-water nuclear power reactors (LWRs) to produce
                    electricity. After I was on the job several months, Chuck took me into his
                    office and explained that my immediate boss, Joel Wit, was going to a think tank
                    to write a book on the negotiations which led to the signing of the AF in 1994.
                    The negotiations leading up to the AF were lead by Ambassador Robert Gallucci.
                    Joel had been on his staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>Chuck told me that someone had to replace Joel, and he wanted me to do it. So in
                    the summer of 1998, I was back at State full time leading the Agreed Framework
                    Division in the Office of Korean Affairs in the East Asia and Pacific Bureau of
                    the Department of State. Life can sometimes be ironic. Two years ago, I had been
                    selected out of the foreign service. Now, two years later, I was a full-time
                    employee at the State Department, doing important and interesting work. Of
                    course, bureaucratically, I had to freeze my retirement pay, and I became a
                    civil servant. But I was happy to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, what were your impressions of dealing with the
                        North Koreans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: The North Koreans were difficult to deal with. They are the only people who
                    practice confrontational diplomacy. They will actually yell at you. I think it's
                    tactical: they know that this upsets people, and gives them a certain advantage.
                    On the other hand, they have a leader at the top who makes all the decisions.
                    There are no checks and balances, so once they make a decision, for example to
                    freeze their nuclear weapons program, it gets done. I thought they were very
                    good at dealing from a position of weakness, pretending they were strong and
                    strutting around and blustering, and getting people to respond to their
                    agenda.</p>
                <p>I am a bit critical of the Clinton administration's North Korea policy. To be
                    fair, their errors were ones of “benign neglect.” After the signing of the AF,
                    the president and the secretary of state went on to other issues, such as the
                    Middle East, thinking the major “lifting” had been done, and all that was left
                    was the execution of the agreement. Well anyone with experience in diplomacy
                    knows that the implementation of an agreement is just as important as the
                    negotiation. In this case, with the AF, the North Koreans had to take all their
                    actions within one month: to freeze their nuclear weapons program, etc., while
                    the main U.S. obligation, to build two LWRs, did not have an explicit timeframe.
                    To make matters more complicated, Clinton signed separate agreements with the
                    South Koreans and Japanese whereby they agreed to finance the LWRs. Clinton knew
                    that Congress would never agree to a multi-billion dollar aid package to North
                    Korea. Our only financial obligation, under the AF, was to supply North Korea
                    with heavy fuel oil (HFO) for North Korea's existing electric power plants until
                    the first LWR came on line. This was a financial commitment of tens of millions
                    of dollars, much less that the two LWRs, which was initially estimated at just
                    under six billion dollars, but would probably cost much more. So the South
                    Koreans and Japanese agreed on paper to finance the LWRs, but then dragged their
                    feet. In the event, their money only started flowing for the LWRs in 2000. The
                    North Koreans got the impression, and I don't think anyone can blame them here,
                    that they had been tricked, that the U.S. didn't really mean to implement the
                    AF.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>For the two years while I worked on the Korean desk, I received weekly complaints
                    from the then political counselor at the North Korean mission to the United
                    Nations, Kim Myong-gil. Kim noted that, although there had been much
                    construction on site in preparation for the LWRs, there was still no
                    construction on the LWRs themselves. He said North Korea had fulfilled all its
                    obligations under the AF, and the U.S. was clearly “insincere.” He said we
                    needed to start building the LWRs. I said that the problem was with South Korea
                    and Japan. He noted this was not a North Korean problem. Since the AF was a
                    bilateral agreement, it was the U.S. responsibility either to secure the
                    financing or finance the project itself. After hearing this complaint many
                    times, one day I finally replied, “So what you're saying is that the U.S. should
                    act like an imperial hegemon, grab South Korean and Japan by their necks, and
                    squeeze them until the money comes out.” He replied, “Yes, exactly so.” I had to
                    suppress a laugh.</p>
                <p>In point of fact, Kim was right. During the time I was on the Korea desk, I
                    repeatedly called the official at the NSC in charge of non-proliferation, Gary
                    Samore, and argued that he needed to explain the situation to the President, and
                    either have the President or the Secretary of State contact their counterparts
                    in the South Korean and Japanese governments and put pressure on them until
                    funds were made available to build the LWRs. Gary would always listen politely,
                    but nothing ever got done. This was particularly galling as Gary had been part
                    of the negotiating team with Ambassador Gallucci that produced the AF. He of all
                    people should have understood the importance of getting the funds flowing to
                    build the LWRs, and the danger of the North Koreans coming to the conclusion
                    that the U.S. never intended to build them, but just wanted to freeze their
                    nuclear program. So I was very frustrated.</p>
                <p>During my year when I replaced Joel, there was one crisis, but it was not induced
                    by the North Koreans. The costs for the HFO rose every year beginning with 1995,
                    but Congressional appropriations did not keep up. The organization charged with
                    implementing the AF was the Korean Peninsula Economic Development Organization
                    (KEDO), based in New York City. It was made up of the United States, Japan, and
                    South Korea, the number one economic power in the world, the number two, and at
                    the time, the number 12. In short, the members of KEDO were rich, and especially
                    so in comparison to North Korea. Yet, since the United States was responsible
                    for providing HFO to North Korea, and since appropriations for the fuel did not
                    cover the costs, I was not surprised in 1998 to receive a call from KEDO stating
                    that after the next shipment of HFO to North Korea, KEDO was broke. There could
                    be no further shipments of fuel oil to North Korea under the Agreed Framework
                    until more money could be secured. I immediately wrote a memo to the Secretary,
                    pointing out that we were in crisis and something had to be done. I had written
                    similar memos before, saying that KEDO was going broke and that if nothing were
                    done, there would be a crisis in the future. I was ignored. Now that a crisis
                    was imminent, the Secretary called a meeting, ordered that certain funds be
                    transferred to KEDO, and a crisis was averted.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>Of course, while I was frustrated by what I considered a lack of focus on the
                    part of the Clinton administration, I didn't realize that events were going to
                    get much worse under the Bush administration. Whereas Clinton merely failed to
                    give the AF priority, Bush and his people, who never liked the agreement, were
                    determined to blow it up. Their goal was to find an excuse to tear up the Agreed
                    Framework. By then, I was in a different position. Joel Wit returned to the
                    Korea Desk in 1999, and it just didn't work out, the two of us being there
                    together. Fortunately, a position opened up in the Department of Energy (DOE),
                    working on the spent fuel part of the AF. The North Koreans, at their reactor in
                    Yongbyon, had produced over 6,000 spent fuel rods. They contained enough
                    plutonium for several nuclear bombs. They were stored at the bottom of a pool at
                    a facility next door to the reactor. It turns out that water is an excellent
                    insulation against nuclear radiation. So under the AF, the North Koreans allowed
                    a team of experts from the U.S. to transfer the spent rods to canisters, then
                    seal the canisters under U.N. supervision. Within the USG, DOE was assigned the
                    task of canning the spent fuel rods. The officer in charge of this at DOE got
                    promoted in 1999, and went to another job. We had been having trouble at State
                    coordinating our policy with DOE, so I argued successfully with Ambassador
                    Kartman that he should transfer me to DOE to work on the spent fuel canning
                    project. I could communicate easily with the Korea desk, so coordination between
                    the two departments would be vastly improved. DOE agreed, so in the fall of
                    1999, I transferred over to the Department of Energy.</p>
                <p>By 2001, with the advent of the Bush administration, it was clear the AF was in
                    trouble. During the first NSC meeting on North Korea, the leading White House
                    official declared if North Korea did not live up to its obligations under the
                    AF, the U.S. would suspend its funding of the LWRs. We had to point out to him
                    that the South Koreans and Japanese were funding the LWRs, not the U.S.
                    Eventually, by 2002, the Bush administration discovered that the North Koreans
                    were cheating on the AF, by starting up a uranium enrichment program. This was
                    probably true, but the uranium enrichment program was in its infancy, so the
                    proper thing to do was to tell the North Koreans: we caught you cheating, now
                    stop it. Instead, we stopped the shipments of HFO, punishing North Korea for its
                    cheating. The North Koreans reacted by declaring the AF null and void, kicking
                    out the U.N. inspectors at Yongbyon, unsealing the canisters, and removing the
                    spent fuel. They then began reprocessing the rods and extracting the plutonium.
                    Eventually, they tested some nuclear weapons, beginning in 2006. So the Bush
                    policy, described as brilliantly tough by its advocates, only succeeded in going
                    from a situation whereby North Korean nuclear material was completely under our
                    control to one whereby the nuclear material was completely back in the hands of
                    the North Koreans. We allowed North Korea to become a nuclear weapons state. It
                    was an incredibly disastrous U.S. policy. However in Bush's second term I
                    believe he finally “got it” by giving Secretary of State Rice the green light to
                    try and restart negotiations with the North Koreans under Ambassador Chris Hill.
                    By then it was probably too little, too late. I believe North Korean leader Kim
                    Jong Il felt Bush was hostile to him, so he (Kim) would never really engage with
                    Bush. North Korea was left with nuclear weapons, and even now, the negotiations
                    are not back on track.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>By 2005, since North Korea would not come to the negotiating table, my job at DOE
                    was reduced to supervising grants to various non-governmental organizations
                    which would hold seminars on ways to reduce nuclear tensions in Northeast Asia.
                    Finally, DOE abolished my job, in the summer of 2005. You are really in a
                    strange position when someone abolishes your job and you agree with them. So I
                    left DOE, and got a job at the Woodrow Wilson Center in D.C., organizing
                    seminars involving leading scholars on China, Japan and Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening in Pyongyang, I mean what was it like
                        to go there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Interesting question. The first time I went to Pyongyang was in 1998.
                    Coming into the city from the airport, it was as if a neutron bomb had exploded.
                    There were literally no people anywhere along the highway into the city, and no
                    cars, except for ours, on the road. In the city, buildings seemed deserted; you
                    couldn't see people on the street. Traffic police were stationed at
                    intersections, but there was no traffic. Occasionally, a bus would appear, but
                    there were no cars. On the television, there were only two channels. Both played
                    reports of Kim Il Song meeting world leaders. This was particularly creepy,
                    since Kim Il Song had been dead for four years. Needless to say, television was
                    not a means of entertainment.</p>
                <p>Essentially, our U.S. delegation was under “hotel house arrest.” It was explained
                    to us clearly that we could only wander outside the hotel for one block, and if
                    we wished to do so, we had to stop off at the hotel's coffee shop, where there
                    would be someone assigned to watch us at all times. If we wanted to go outside,
                    we had to be escorted by the “minder.” Also, if we were to use the services of
                    the minder, we had to provide the minder with a meal, no matter what time it
                    was. I thought this outrageous, so I remained in the hotel. Each year from 1998
                    to 2002 when I went back the city was becoming more populated, and things got
                    more lively. By the last visit in 2002, things were almost normal. There were
                    people on the streets, and people eating in restaurants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you just sit around? There must have been other
                        western or other guests in the hotel sitting around too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, there were, and we would chat, so that was a bit of a diversion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do, ordinarily, take a book?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>MOHR: Yes, we read a lot. But during the day, we were in negotiations, and after
                    work, there were usually official dinners. And each trip lasted only three-four
                    days. I mean, no one wanted to spend an extended amount of time there. One time,
                    I almost got in trouble. I brought a mystery book, set in South Korea. While
                    reading it, I became alarmed that the plot involved a rogue Navy SEAL, who was
                    employed by North Korea as a spy to discover the location of U.S. nuclear
                    weapons in South Korea. I was afraid that if the North Koreans read the
                    book—since I had no doubt that they searched our rooms while we were in
                    negotiations—they would feign outrage and not let me leave. Fortunately, they
                    never said anything about the book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But overall, you never could get close to them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: That's correct. It was much like dealing with the Chinese in the 1970s.
                    There was no real personal interaction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, when you left how did things stand with North
                        Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: By 2005, things were sort of in limbo, much in the same way as they are
                    today. As I said, the North Koreans were in control again of their spent nuclear
                    fuel, and were on their way to reprocessing it, extracting the plutonium, and
                    testing nuclear weapons. The only good thing about the situation was that we
                    knew North Korea did not have the technology to miniaturize the nuclear bombs to
                    fit their missiles. Thus, their nuclear weapons program did not represent an
                    immediate threat because they had no delivery system for their weapons.
                    Unfortunately, the Obama administration has too much on its plate now, with wars
                    in both Afghanistan and Iraq, fighting Al-Qaeda, and dealing with Iran, to focus
                    on North Korea. This is too bad. Now, I don't believe North Korea represents an
                    international threat. The people who suffer most are probably the North Koreans
                    themselves. The regime has made it clear that it cares about security and the
                    military first, and if there is not enough food, and people starve, too bad. It
                    is a tragic situation, and I wish the current administration would devote a
                    little more attention to it.</p>
                <p>Dealing with the Bush administration on North Korea helped me put my overall
                    career in perspective. For most of my career, I dealt with China policy. We
                    always had the support of the White House. I thought this was the norm, because
                    I didn't know anything else. Dealing with the Bush administration on North
                    Korea, I never had the support of the White House. I was tremendously frustrated
                    and disappointed. But in looking back over my whole career, I realized how lucky
                    I was. For the most part, I was allowed to contribute to the positive
                    advancement and improvement of U.S.-China relations. When I started out, in the
                    1970s, there had been a war over Korea, and a war with Vietnam was in progress.
                    Nixon established ties with China, and Carter normalized those ties, but who
                    knew what would happen? Now, a third war in Asia, or a war with China, seems
                    extremely remote, if not impossible. I am greatly satisfied with my career, even
                    if the last few years working on North Korea produced no results.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in 2005, then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOHR: I spent a few months unemployed (but still receiving my retirement check
                    from State), and, as noted above, signed on with the Wilson Center, doing work
                    on northeast Asia. I did that for three years, and then retired for good in
                    2008. Now I teach English three times a week to immigrant groups, one to Chinese
                    retirees, one to recent Korean immigrants to the U.S., and one to
                    pre-kindergarten Hispanic children, ages 3-5. It's a nice balance.</p>
                <p>I'm also studying Italian. I went to Italy last year for the first time with my
                    wife, and we're planning on spending two weeks in Florence this spring. I spent
                    most of my life studying about East Asia, and now I want to learn a little bit
                    about western civilization. I think I'll start with the Italian Renaissance. I
                    also work out at a local health club two to three times a week. About two years
                    ago, I gained a considerable amount of weight, and reached 210 lbs. (I am 5'11”
                    tall.) My doctor said unless I lost weight, I would soon develop Type II
                    diabetes. That was certainly a wake-up call, so I went on a diet, and lost 35
                    pounds. And I have been able to hold that weight loss. I am also helped by my
                    wife, who is very supportive.</p>
                <p>I found that I really don't miss the foreign service all that much, and enjoy
                    being retired. Of course, we spend as much time as possible visiting the
                    grandchildren: my daughter, who is a pediatrician, is married and lives in the
                    Boston area. She has two children, Will who is seven, and Lily who is four. My
                    son, who has a Ph.D. in African anthropology and teaches at the University of
                    Pennsylvania, is married and has one son, who is two. My grandchildren are all
                    very cute, and all the wonderful things people say about being a grandparent are
                    true.</p>
                <p>Well, that's about it.</p>
