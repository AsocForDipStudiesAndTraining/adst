                <p>Interviewed by: Willis Armstrong </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: August 23, 1989</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're going to be talking about how Ambassador Wilkowski
                        became interested in the Foreign Service and how she progressed in it. Would
                        you start anywhere, Jean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, Bill, I will. When I was in college, I certainly had no idea of
                    going into the Foreign Service. I was a Journalism major and French minor. My
                    first job was as an instructor at Barry College in Miami, Florida. Among other
                    things I was doing publicity for the college, and I had to cover a very
                    interesting meeting of American Historians who had just come back from Lima,
                    Peru. I thought their experiences were fascinating. I was finishing two years of
                    teaching and getting ready to go to Chicago to take a job with the United Press.
                    I wanted eventually to get into work as a foreign correspondent in Europe.</p>
                <p>There was a sociologist at the Miami conference who asked, “Why don't you
                    consider the Foreign Service at the State Department in Washington on your way
                    to Chicago?” I said, “It's a little bit out of the way.” But I did just that,
                    carrying a letter of recommendation to some friend of his who was an Assistant
                    Secretary.</p>
                <p>Do you want to ask me questions, or should I just go on?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, just go on from there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: All right. So I did go to Washington, and I stayed there with friends
                    of the family. I called on this Assistant Secretary of State (his name may have
                    been Howland). He suggested I go to the Employment Office, which, of course, is
                    where you go if you're looking for a job. But I wasn't terribly serious about it
                    since I was interested in the United Press job in Chicago.</p>
                <p>But I did apply for the Foreign Service. I never will forget what the interviewer
                    said. “You don't know how lucky you are,” he insisted.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>“Why is that?” I asked, pretty green and nervous.</p>
                <p>“You know,” he replied, “this is October 1944 and we've lost a lot of men to the
                    Armed Forces. We're literally scraping the bottom of the barrel for recruits.”
                    I'll always remember that phrase—that I came from the bottom of the barrel.
                    “We're scraping the bottom of the barrel,” he continued, “by taking in 4-Fs
                    (physically unfit for the military) and women.” Four-Fs came first.
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>You know, I was too shy to say, “Well, gee, thanks.” Give me a break, or just,
                    “Thank you, good day.” But I said, “Oh, that's interesting.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Would you like to be a vice consul.”</p>
                <p>I asked, “What's a vice consul?” He explained and then sent me to another part of
                    the bureaucracy in the old Walker Johnson Building. By midday I had formally
                    applied. I hung around Washington for a month and then was enrolled in the
                    Foreign Service Auxiliary which was the way they did it in wartime. I went to
                    Trinidad, then later took the examination to be a full-fledged FSO. So that's
                    how I got started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's almost exactly the same as my wife's experience.
                        (Louise Shaffner Armstrong)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Is that right?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was a vice consul in the Auxiliary, and they sent her
                        to Marquesas, and then she went to Canada.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: I see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you know her? In Montreal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: No, I met Louise first in Washington, I believe. Later we were very
                    close in Geneva, 1955-56, during a round of GATT tariff negotiations. We were
                    both on the U.S. delegation negotiating with France, also the European coal and
                    steel community. We worked for Charlie O'Donnell. That's where Louise and I
                    became friends. We both loved to hike and ski so we were always off on the
                    weekends with other American and Austrian friends to ski and hike in Switzerland
                    and France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to Trinidad now. What did you do in Trinidad
                        and what was it like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Well, I was, as they told me, a vice consul in Port- of-Spain,
                    Trinidad, then a British Crown Colony. The office consisted of Consul Claude
                    Hall (there for 7 years) and myself. That was the staff plus 4-5 locals. He told
                    me he hated shipping and all these over-bearing sea captains who come in here
                    and cursed all over the place. “You take them over,” he ordered. I was supposed
                    to charm and quiet them, I guess.</p>
                <p>They had different problems. The most amusing was the fact that most of them had
                    venereal disease and they had to be cured before they got to the States. So the
                    captain would come in, hem and haw, until I finally asked, “Is it the usual,
                    Captain?” He would say, “Yeah.” So I'd sign the seamen off the ship, to send
                    them out to the U.S. Naval Base or hospital for the 2 weeks treatment. Then I'd
                    sign them back on the ship. I also visaed the crew list, mediated union
                    disputes, etc.</p>
                <p>Once during a union dispute the Captain refused to do anything until I signed off
                    some of the offending crew so the ship could sail to the U.S. I also did general
                    consular work—citizenship for Americans, visas for Trinidadians. I had fun with
                    that. Once I told some calypso singers going to the U.S. that one of the
                    requirements was they sing for the Consulate before they got their visa to prove
                    that, indeed, they had a profession and were legitimately en route to make
                    recordings. So we used to have these mini-concerts in the Consulate.
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>In the meantime, poor old Consul Claude Hall was in the back room doing whatever
                    he did—a lot of political work related to the U.S.-UK base agreement with its
                    legal problems. President Roosevelt had exchanged over- age U.S. destroyers—were
                    they 46 or 67 destroyers—for some strategic war- time bases in the Caribbean. We
                    had a big naval base—Macqueryie—on the north coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of them was Trinidad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes. Trinidad was one of them. There was also Waller Field in the
                    middle of the island—the longest maintenance line in the U.S. Army Air Corps.
                    Indeed, my brother—a pilot—had stopped there on his way to north Africa and
                    Europe. We also had an Army Docksite shipping base on Trinidad—3-5 major
                    installations in all.</p>
                <p>So the Consul did all of the base negotiation with the British Colonial
                    Government and with the U.S. armed forces there in Trinidad. I did all the other
                    consular work alone, some economic reporting. There is a lot of cacao down
                    there, as you know. During the war some American candy companies which had
                    gotten their coconut supplies elsewhere came to Trinidad. I remember the Peter
                    Paul people were looking for coconut for their candy bars. There were also
                    exports of lime juice, and small commercial transactions. Finally, we had much
                    to do with the first major crash of a Pan American Airways Clipper plane,
                    including loss of American lives.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about oil? Were they exporting oil from Trinidad at
                        that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Not as extensively as in later years. It was pretty much a limited
                    British concession. I visited the oil fields, which were down in the south of
                    the island. But oil was a minor thing at that time before the big strikes and
                    exports which came later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. The fuels didn't really come into production until
                        later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: The oil boom for Trinidad came in the late '60s or early '70s, if I
                    recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your shipping was not tanker shipping. It was just
                        miscellaneous.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: No. No tankers but big merchant ships from Africa, but more
                    importantly bauxite transhipment from then British Guiana, and a lot of shipping
                    captains would give me the eye and say, “Why don't you come down to B.G. and see
                    the monkeys.” I wasn't too keen on going down there either for monkeys or monkey
                    shines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You should have gone. It's a fascinating place. I visited
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: No. I had one experience on a ship out of Trinidad bound for New
                    Orleans. I was a work-away and the only woman on board, but I didn't have that
                    experience to guide me. It was just instinct that said, “Better not go down to
                    B.G. as a guest of the captain.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Instinct is always a good guide. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: So, at any rate, that's what I did in Trinidad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember a famous remark by Libby Merchant when he was
                        Ambassador in Canada in regard to a distinguished Canadian who shall remain
                        nameless. He said, “You know, the trouble with that man is, it's nothing
                        wrong with his intellect, it's his instincts that are defective.” He was a
                        very senior man. He was quite right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Well, I think women are extraordinarily gifted with instinct and with
                    intuition, and I think it's important in diplomacy. A State historian, name of
                    Care, I believe, wrote the first book (sometime in the '50s) about women in the
                    Foreign Service. In there is a quotation from me wherein I emphasize the great
                    complementarities between the gifts of women and the gifts of men. I think they
                    tend to be distinctive. It's crazy to think that women and men are constituted
                    the same in the way they generally think and act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're not. I agree.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: They're absolutely different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My first job was teaching in a girl's high school. I
                        learned that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, men and women are different. But we were made in a complementary
                    fashion. We were created to complement one another, and that is the beauty of
                    men and women working together. As Ambassador John Jova used to say, “Together
                    they create beautiful things.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You get a multiplier effect, not only biologically.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you do. Well, I think it's very important, and
                        it's much too slow in coming. How long were you in Trinidad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: I was there about 18 months with Claude Hall the Consul most of the
                    time, then Ellis Bonnet. From there to Bogota, Colombia. I still hadn't made up
                    my mind whether I wanted to stay in the Foreign Service. To me it was still a
                    war job. I had some exciting times when President Roosevelt died, you know.
                    Claude Hall didn't want to go to the cathedral as the U.S. representative, so
                    there I was up on the altar with all the dignitaries. It was kind of heady stuff
                    for a 25-year old. It grips you and inflates you. After the Caribbean and Latin
                    America I wanted to see Europe, so I stayed in.</p>
                <p>The Bogota assignment was terribly exciting because of the “Bogotazo”- -a
                    national uprising which lasted 8-10 years. It started with the assassination of
                    Gaitan, the political party leader, the break-out of nearly 5,000 prisoners from
                    jails, looting and rioting. The uprising was said to be inspired by Fidel
                    Castro.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>My job in the Embassy was economic and commercial reporting. The fireworks
                    started during a lunch hour. People were running in all directions. The Embassy
                    bus dropped us off and then began our nearly24-hour ordeal with much plunder and
                    killing in the streets. We were marooned without food or sleep.</p>
                <p>Roy Rubottom and Aaron Brown were our political reporting officers who sent
                    hourly reports to the Department. Willard Beaulac was our Ambassador. Assistant
                    Secretary Norman Armour was in Bogota for the Inter- American conference.</p>
                <p>The “Bogotazo” radically changed the history of Colombia, setting Liberals
                    against Conservatives for years in bloody strife. Finally, legislation was
                    passed alternating the presidency between the two parties.</p>
                <p>I did coffee reporting, shipping affairs, cost of living, budget, monetary and
                    fiscal policy. Pretty routine things. And then I thought, the Foreign Service is
                    interesting, I've had Trinidad and the problems of U.S. bases overseas, then
                    Bogota, Colombia and Latin America relations. I wanted a change—to take a look
                    at Europe before I decided if the Foreign Service was for life. I was assigned
                    to Milan, Italy and I went there in 1950 to take over the commercial section,
                    did a lot of very interesting work with American companies coming over after the
                    war wanting to invest, have licensing arrangements or engage in imports and
                    exports. We had an excellent local staff, very good people, very supportive and
                    very helpful. They also made good friends.</p>
                <p>As a result of the Milan experience I was called back to head the Italian desk at
                    the Department of Commerce. Frankly I didn't care too much about it. I missed
                    being in the mainstream at State. My colleagues proved a different breed. But in
                    some ways it was good preparation for a later assignment to the GATT Tariff
                    negotiations because we needed significant contributions from Commerce and other
                    agencies. So I learned, you know, how to work between agencies in Washington,
                    which is pretty important. That was in the early '50s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Milan? Were you there for the famous
                        election in Italy? No, that was '48, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: I was there 1950-51.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fifty, fifty-one. This was after the Marshall Plan and
                        after that election?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Not quite, AID was still operating there. There wasn't anything major
                    going on in Italy which was trying to get back on its feet economically. It was
                    before the “Miracle” of the sixties.” You remember that Norman Armour's daughter
                    was married to Ambassador James Dunn. He headed our Rome mission. The big thing
                    in Milan was the annual Trade Fair and the Ambassador always brought up a big
                    delegation from the Embassy. Dunn was a good Ambassador. His wife Mary was very
                    gracious and had a good sense of humor. She agreed to have the Italian Garden
                    Club name a rose for her. They told her, “it did well in beds!” The Zellerbachs
                    came after Dunn. Different people—very political and less Foreign Service
                    oriented.</p>
                <p>Milan was Europe for the first time. It was a wonderful introduction and made me
                    decide in favor of taking the Foreign Service exam. I was assigned to Paris,
                    took the exam there and then came in. I was Assistant Commercial Attach� in
                    Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was about '52, '53?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Fifty-three to fifty-six. Then I was sent on TDY from Paris over to
                    Geneva to the GATT Tariff negotiations. Our Ambassador in Paris was Douglas
                    Dillon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I know him, as a matter of fact.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Graham Martin was our administrative / consular officer there. I got
                    to know him well, in fact, did some cost of living work for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think of Graham Martin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: He was a very controversial figure and a secretive man, as you
                    probably know. He was last living in North Carolina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: I think he used very bad judgment in that case of the classified
                    papers left in the back of his car.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very intense man, I thought.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Very intense man. Former newspaperman. Not a bad Ambassador, I don't
                    think, but he made strange friends, like Michele Sindona in Italy. I don't
                    believe he ever learned a foreign language, but he did know how to use
                    people—staff and outsiders—and he relied heavily on them for information. I
                    think he was a good collector of facts, a good analyst. There was something
                    mysterious but likable about him. I felt kindly toward him. It was he who later
                    asked me in the early '70s, if I wanted to become an Ambassador. If I did,
                    Washington was asking him what he thought of me. [Chuckle] He would recommend me
                    if I wanted to be an Ambassador, he said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he did have good judgment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Thank you. Strange, he always acted as though he was playing a CIA
                    game. He had that inclination to clandestine kinds of operation, secretive, so
                    you never really knew the whole Graham Martin. But he had a soft spot, and he
                    was always very good to me and quite frankly I tried to please him and merit his
                    approval and respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I knew him. I found him a very decent guy, really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Indeed. That's what I want to say. He was very much interested in
                    other human beings. When he was retired and would come wandering into the
                    Department, he would always make a point of looking you up. And it wasn't just
                    for old times sake. It's because he was genuinely interested in others and their
                    work in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a warmer person than he ever got credit for being,
                        I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Oh, yes, he was. He was, and his wife, Dottie, was a lot of fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't know her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: In sum, Graham Martin was a mysterious, unfathomable character, who
                    seemed to delight in this image. He seemed more off-putting to men than
                    women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a strange man, more strange than a lot of CIA
                        people. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: He dealt with Foreign Service people very fairly, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, within the Service on a career basis, he was very
                        fair and reasonable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: I think so. He wouldn't hesitate to recommend people. For example,
                    there was a young man working for me. He called me down and asked me what I
                    thought of him. He wanted to recommend him as a Consul General, and I said,
                    “Yes, I thought he could do a good job, but...” and as we were trained to do,
                    listed the positive and the negative with emphasis on the former. Well, he got
                    this consular post, and then almost immediately pursued a negative trait. It set
                    Graham's teeth on edge. The man was a long time getting his ambassadorship.
                    Indeed, he was a D.C.M. for a very long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had acquired Italian. How about other languages? Did
                        you have Spanish when you were in Bogota, and Italian later, and
                        French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Well, I was a French minor in college. Indeed, that's one of the
                    projects I'm working on now is trying to encourage exchange scholarships between
                    France and the U.S. When I left college, I had no French-speaking ability though
                    I knew Cornielle, Racine and Moliere. My first speaking language was learned in
                    Bogota. I had to transact business in the Embassy economic section in Spanish. I
                    worked with the coffee producers, exporters and shippers, and so I had to learn
                    Spanish to get the trade trends and statistics. I acquired Spanish, Italian and
                    French. During my tours in the Foreign Service I was interested in languages,
                    and I think I have some facility with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that as you went along. That was sort of part of
                        your job to learn the local language so you could make it go.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, part of my self-education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you take special language training while you were in
                        those posts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes. I always went in for the course at post in Bogota, on my own in
                    Milan, and in Embassy classes in Rome and Paris, also at the Foreign Service
                    Institute. I took intensive Spanish before I went to Chile, and a refresher
                    before Honduras. I think the greatest lessons I had in Italian came from buying
                    a farm with another Foreign Service Officer in Tuscany. I had to deal with the
                    plumbers and the carpenters and the electricians and the real estate people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the tariff negotiations in '56, did you then go to
                        Chile?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, I did, but after a year back in the U.S. After I took the exams
                    in Paris, I was offered mid-career training, either at Harvard Business School
                    or graduate economics at Berkeley. I chose the latter and again your wife Louise
                    and I overlapped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were both at Berkeley at the same time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes. We were both at Berkeley together, both studying economics.
                    Looking back on my career, I think I may have made a mistake. I didn't need
                    graduate study in economics. I had this deep interest in business and the
                    activities of American firms overseas. I think it might have gotten me into the
                    corporate world sooner and with greater facility. And it might have led to
                    different things. However, I don't regret my Foreign Service career at all. It's
                    been a good career with only minor complaints—don't we all—as well as
                    appreciation for all the opportunities I had and the marvelous experiences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What years were you at Berkeley?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: I was there from the fall of '56 to the spring of '57. Then I was
                    assigned to Bolivia. By then my father had died and my mother became my
                    responsibility for about 12 years, and I could not take a sick woman up to La
                    Paz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: So the Department kindly switched me to Santiago, Chile. I've
                    forgotten where Louise went from that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She came back here to the Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Did she?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's when I met her in '57.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Santiago was very interesting. I did monetary and fiscal policy work
                    in the economic section of the Embassy. It was kind of heady stuff, you know,
                    recommending on $40 million development loans and dealing with the Minister of
                    Finance, and the Manager of the Central Bank, Felipe Herrera—now here in D.C.
                    with the Inter-American Development Bank, I believe. Also I dealt with Enrique
                    Iglesias of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you Economic Counselor then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: No, I was Second Secretary, Economic. It was highly educational and I
                    developed some very good relationships. I enjoyed it very, very much. The
                    Klein-Sachs people were there as advisors, also Kenneth Galbraith of
                    Harvard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Chilean officials always had a better understanding of
                        economics than almost anybody in Latin America, in my experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, they did. They really did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I used to go to inter-American meetings. The only guys you
                        could really talk to were the Chileans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: They were indeed very savvy. And there was an interesting sidelight to
                    my experience there. A lot of the young men at the Central Bank, the head of
                    statistics and the head of research whom I dealt with, were Communists who later
                    bolted and went up to help Fidel Castro in Cuba. The Department asked me what I
                    knew about these people and I suddenly had an extensive bio-reporting job on my
                    hands as these young men had become some of the leading economic advisors to
                    Castro.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a real derogation from their economics education,
                        isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes. Besides a good-sized AID mission in Santiago we had an impressive
                    Economic/Commercial Section headed by Bob Eakens of Texas and Bob Dorr, also
                    Ralph Richardson, Minerals Attach� and 3-4 others of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bob Eakens was an old friend. He worked with me before
                        that when he headed a petroleum division for the Embassy. I'm still in touch
                        with him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Are you really!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. We exchange Christmas cards. Bob is a very

                </p>

                <p>WILKOWSKI: He was very savvy in the economic field. I always thought Bob was a
                    little awkward though because he was not brought up in the Foreign Service. He
                    was a specialist who came in as a senior officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. He's a very domesticated Texan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes. And he always was a bit on guard with the old Foreign Service
                    types, but he was fair and reasonable. Not terribly imaginative, but a pleasant
                    guy to work with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wh, he's a nice man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes. We had a good crowd of people in Santiago. I finished there in
                    '59 and went on home leave to Hawaii. Then I went to the GATT tariff
                    negotiations in Geneva, the Dillon round, and was there for about a year and a
                    half. Very interesting assignment. I was deputy to Herman Walker on the U.S.
                    team negotiating with the EEC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sixty-sixty one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: GATT was a very interesting assignment. It was the first time that the
                    EEC had applied as an institution to the GATT for admission. As you know its
                    accession had to be negotiated from the combined tariffs of the original six
                    members covered in the Treaty of Rome of 1953. It was a very complex thing
                    getting all the EC tariffs aligned and then negotiating from a single, new
                    tariff.</p>
                <p>I had a second job which was to head up the Spanish accession. The Spaniards were
                    a bit skittish dealing with a woman, despite my efforts at trying to put them at
                    ease speaking Spanish.</p>
                <p>Assistant Secretary George Ball was not pleased when the Spaniards came to him
                    and complained that “the U.S. negotiator handling the Spanish accession was too
                    tough.” This after I had first tried to ascertain if they were to be treated as
                    “big boys” or as a developing country. As it turned out, the Spaniards backed
                    off after 3-4 sessions and the negotiations weren't resumed until several months
                    following the Dillon Round.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were then in the GATT negotiations in '60-'61?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: That's right. And then I was assigned to Rome, in '63, and I was there
                    until '66.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I remember we encountered each other for part of
                        that time, because you were Economic Counselor at Rome, weren't you, or
                        Economic Minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: That was later in 1970-73. On my first Rome tour I started out as
                    deputy to the Economic Minister, Sydney Mellen. I was number two there in the
                    economic section. Sydney couldn't go to a conference in Vienna in 1966 and I
                    represented Rome there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sixty-nine, that's when you were Economic Minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, '70-'73. I started out as Commercial Counselor because there was
                    an opening there. I can't say I was thrilled, having been DCM and charg� in
                    Central America. Personnel said, “You're going to be an Ambassador and it's
                    better to park you there than in Washington.” [Chuckle] You know, all these cute
                    little arrangements the Department makes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now in between Italy you were in Honduras?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Rome like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Rome was the second of three assignments in Italy. It involved
                    renegotiation of the civil air agreement which was very, very interesting. It
                    was a negotiation of standstill arrangement on Italian shoe exports, that even
                    brought out Secretary of the Treasury to Rome. At times I didn't feel too
                    honorable doing them as it involved twisting the arm of our allies. But there
                    was some interesting work and involved interesting people from Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were keeping people from getting good Italian
                        shoes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: I suppose so. It was, after all, U.S. Government policy—protectionist
                    as regards U.S. shoe interests. The shoe work came after I had worked for Sydney
                    Mellen whom I did not get along with at all. Sydney tried hard to have me
                    transferred to the Kennedy round of GATT negotiations in Geneva in 1963, but he
                    didn't succeed. I stayed on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not very many people got on with Sydney Mellen.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Freddie Reinhardt was the Ambassador in Rome in my first tour there,
                    and I think he suspected as much. Both Wells Stabler, the DCM, and he were
                    somewhat protective of me. I felt that Sydney could be very arbitrary, and there
                    were other personal problems with Sydney which we can discuss privately. [Tape
                    turned off]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went off to Honduras as the DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: That's right, Bill, and I was pretty excited about that though I had
                    the wind taken out of my sails in one of those sensitivity training courses up
                    in Garmisch in Germany. You know, those were the years when outside consultants
                    regarded the Foreign Service as a bunch of stuffed shirts, only Princeton and
                    Yale types (certainly not true), but thought we didn't really communicate well
                    with one another. So some person in management wanted to ape what corporations
                    were doing in sending personnel off to sensitivity training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: There was Dean Hinton and all of these administrative counselors from
                    embassies throughout Europe. It was a humbling but fascinating experience. I was
                    to have gone there with another woman FSO, but it turned out I was the only
                    woman in the group. My mother, who had been my dependent for nearly 12 years,
                    had just died, and I was very fragile emotionally.</p>
                <p>At any rate, it didn't take the sensitivity process long to unravel me. The
                    so-called hot seat would tear people to pieces. One of the participants in all
                    frankness wanted to know, “What makes you think that you can be a DCM?”</p>
                <p>And my answer to that was, “I'm not sure I can until I try. I did not apply for
                    the job. I've been assigned there, and in the Foreign Service you go and do the
                    best you can with the assignment you have. So I'm going to Honduras, and I'm
                    going to do just that.” [Laughter] This reply made the fellow who asked very
                    angry.</p>
                <p>So, at lunch that day, I said to the sensitivity trainer, “What kind of a
                    question is that to the only woman in the class? Do you know why? It's because
                    there isn't another person in this room—all men—who has been assigned as a DCM,
                    and that's nothing but sentimental jealousy. They want to put me down.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Why didn't you say that? That's what you're supposed to say in a
                    training session like this. It's called leveling and openness.”</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>And I said, “Well, that's not how we're trained to behave in the Foreign
                    Service.” One has to use discretion and diplomacy.” Now, since I have retired
                    from the Foreign Service, I have become one of the most outspoken women you
                    know. And people say to me, “You were in the diplomatic service?” And I say,
                    “yes.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have to remember that diplomatic service doesn't mean
                        just getting along with people and being nice to them. It means getting
                        people to do what you want them to do and having them like you just the
                        same.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: And think it was their idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And think it was their idea. And you use this more inside
                        than you do outside because there are certain conventions in dealing with
                        foreigners, and the code does work when you're dealing with fellow
                        Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: You hit upon something very important. When I was in the Foreign
                    Service, people asked me, “Is it difficult being a woman?” I usually said, “No,”
                    rather than labor the subject. But negotiations within the Foreign Service were
                    usually far and away more difficult than on the outside with foreigners. I was
                    accepted on the outside as a representative of the U.S. Government (sex was
                    ignored). If I was assigned to work with this ministry or that, the people there
                    knew they had to do business with me and they did. Whereas within the Service,
                    there was this terrible competition for promotion. Obviously men preferred to
                    compete with their own. There was no open jealousy, it was always subtle and
                    unspoken, but felt. I had to ignore it and get on with the job. There was
                    tension, and you had to be extremely careful within your organization not to
                    step on toes, offend sensibilities, but it tended to be one-way. That was my
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I once had a compliment from some foreigner about what a
                        good job Americans do of negotiating, which wasn't the normal compliment we
                        got from foreigners. And I said, “Well, you know, one reason is we get so
                        much practice at home.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're always beating up with each other's agencies,
                        beating each other up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: In Washington, that's certainly true.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I spent years fighting the Commerce Department, and,
                        you know, I wouldn't let them in the room if I could help it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Commerce. Commerce was something else from my 2 years experience there
                    on TDY.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Commerce was really a bunch of clucks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Sure they were. They were not first-class people except at the
                    top.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Once in a while, but they didn't last long if they were
                        good. They found a job somewhere else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: That's right. I had two assignments there, one as the Italian desk
                    officer and one with Michel George over in export control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Michel and I were in business on COCOM for a
                        thousand years, it felt like.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: And Murray Renert in export control. Murray was very nice to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he was all right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: I was assigned to Paris to work for Sid Jacques in COCOM, and by the
                    time I got there somebody in the Embassy had jumped in and taken my job, and I
                    was given what he had left. And, you know, I still don't feel very kindly
                    towards that person. But that's the way it is.</p>
                <p>Well, back to Honduras. Yes, I went there, notwithstanding the fact that some of
                    my colleagues at Garmisch at the sensitivity course thought that I was totally
                    unqualified! or just too zealous to be honest. Ambassador John Jova was chief of
                    mission and a man of great sensitivity, and we got along just well. I learned
                    something from him that I had never felt before, certainly not with Sydney
                    Mellow, that is, Jova valued a woman's opinions, and insights. Back to our
                    earlier statement that men and women each have something distinctive to
                    contribute.</p>
                <p>Now Roz Ridgway, former Assistant Secretary for European Affairs, doesn't like to
                    make these distinctions. In fact, she detests the label “woman ambassador.” I
                    hesitate to try to analyze that but I did feel that in Honduras I became really
                    conscious of the fact that my intuitions and instincts were useful in problem
                    solving. At least John Jova made me feel so.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jova is a very civilized guy, indeed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Very sensitive, very cultured, man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, very civilized.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: So he made me feel more competent than I had ever felt, and made to
                    feel so. I think I became more competent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: And things worked out well. We had the famous BALPA (personnel
                    reduction) exercise where we had to rip through the Embassy and cut out about a
                    third to a half of our complement. We had a big AID and military mission there,
                    also a large Peace Corps of over 300.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're saying that aid to Honduras alienates the Contras?
                        [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Not quite. But we had a very difficult AID mission director who
                    thought he was chief of mission, and was a thorn in the side of the Ambassador
                    all the time. I was part buffer, part intermediary. Honduras was a good
                    experience in overall management and program direction, also handling a lot of
                    people with diverse missions and assignments: AID, military, Peace Corps, USIA,
                    and many visiting firemen.</p>
                <p>There was the Nelson Rockefeller mission. I was the control officer for that. It
                    was pretty exciting. You remember Rockefeller was shot at in Honduras—the first
                    stop on his trip to Latin America. That called for coordination and involvement
                    of the entire mission and wives! Also we had the famous soccer war between
                    Honduras and El Salvador. John Jova had left post for a new assignment. I was
                    charg�. The Hondurans ungraciously contended Jova knew the war was coming and,
                    left before. That was July 14. It lasted 10 days. The experience of being in
                    charge of a mission of over 300 was my really big break. I was in charge in
                    Honduras for about four months before the new Ambassador Hewson Ryan, came
                    in.</p>
                <p>The Salvadorans drove 18 miles across the border into Honduras and shelled the
                    border area heavily with artillery fire. They also flew C-40s over and bombed
                    Tegucigalpa. Electricity and communications were cut and, of course, the airport
                    was intermittently closed. It was like being under siege and there were some
                    casualties in the American community. The biggest human problem involved the
                    52,000 Salvadoran squatters in Honduras.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The Honduran Government rounded them up at gunpoint and threw them in the soccer
                    stadiums in San Pedro Sula in the north and Tegucigalpa in the central
                    highlands. The Salvadorans so incarcerated were left without provision for their
                    care—limited water, sanitation, no blankets, food, shelter, no medicine.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the Honduran Government from the President through the Prime Minister
                    was after the U.S. to supply defensive arms and ammunition.</p>
                <p>The Embassy was faced with two policy issues: (1) to become involved in the
                    humanitarian emergency, not only the incarcerated Salvadorans but thousands of
                    Hondurans displaced from their homes in the war zone on the border and also
                    without basic human needs; (2) to respond positively or negatively to the arms
                    request.</p>
                <p>The Embassy's recommendation on (2) was negative; indeed a policy of
                    “even-handedness” between El Salvador and Honduras was almost immediately set in
                    Washington. On (1) we recommended basic assistance and promptly levied a
                    significant request on U.S. Army HQ in Panama. We flew in 10 plane loads of
                    assistance. We encountered problems with the President's wife (!) who wanted
                    help to go only to the Hondurans. We ignored her pleas and much of the help went
                    to the Salvadorans who were in the majority.</p>
                <p>We also called in and assisted observers from the OAS. We were very busy. It was
                    a time for rapid decisions, sound decisions, and judgments. We were attacked
                    many times by demonstrators, and I had to give clear and careful instructions to
                    the Marine Guard Detachment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the soccer war with El Salvador, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: That's right. There had been...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Salvadorans outnumber the Hondurans by about four to
                        one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, they have a real population problem. The whole trouble started
                    when squatters from El Salvador moved in on the Hondurans around San Pedro Sula,
                    taking over untilled lands. It was a case of land occupation. They just didn't
                    have enough space in Salvador for their population. This created tensions which
                    flared up at soccer games between the two countries. Pressures built up until
                    the Salvadoran army just decided to move into Honduras.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They've still got the same problems, so why shoot each
                        other?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: It's not easy to tell them. There was a little dust-up in Tegucigalpa
                    when the Salvadorans came over to play football, minor pushing and shoving
                    there. But when the Hondurans went to Salvador, that's when the thing really hit
                    the fan and popular sentiment got out of hand. There was terrible fighting after
                    that football game. A lot of Hondurans were stopped on their return, spat upon,
                    and worse, bags of— believe it or not—bags of urine were thrown at them. I can't
                    imagine people collecting this for such an occasion, but they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what the students did at the Democratic convention,
                        you know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Really? I didn't know that.</p>
                <p>There was another problem which involved differing points of view and
                    interpretation of the events between Embassy Managua and Embassy Tegucigalpa. We
                    had our own “mini-war” as Managua reported far too sympathetically to the
                    Salvadoran military, even assuming some of their arrogant, over-bearing
                    manners.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador there was so hard-nosed he had the gall to send his own political
                    officer over to Tegucigalpa. What else with a woman DCM in charge. We managed to
                    clip his wings, set him straight and send him back. After all, Honduras was
                    invaded and bombed because of tempers over a football game and resentment over
                    land squatters. A real cause for war?</p>
                <p>When the radio reported post-game actions, the people of Honduras reacted by
                    simply attacking these Salvadoran squatters up in the north- central part of the
                    country. They shot and harassed them. There was a funny little story about one
                    of the American bishops in Honduras, a Dominican, who was approached by a
                    Salvadoran Madam of a house of prostitution and her little bevy of girls, asking
                    for protection. They were all Salvadorans, of course—squatters of a different
                    sort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did he do, start a nunnery? [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: No, he didn't start a nunnery. But he kept the Madam overnight at his
                    place, which, for appearances was bad. But he was giving her sanctuary. He got
                    her on the plane the next day. He told the story to us at the Embassy, and it
                    was hysterical</p>
                <p>It was a very exciting time with the many policy issues and tensions. There were
                    over 56,000 Salvadorans who were simply herded into the two stadiums. There was
                    a real human problem there, human suffering. Before recommending assistance I
                    asked the President of Honduras if he had any objections to such assistance.
                    “No. If you want to send relief, fine.”</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Then we had Peace Corps people straying across the lines, who eventually had to
                    be bailed out of a Salvadoran jail—this despite my strict orders to keep out of
                    the war zone. In another instance a bomb dropped from a C-47 landed in the house
                    of a Peace Corps volunteer. He called me and said, “You're in charge. What are
                    you going to do? A bomb just came through my roof and narrowly missed my baby's
                    crib.”</p>
                <p>I said, “The baby alive there?”</p>
                <p>“Yes.”</p>
                <p>“Did it explode?”</p>
                <p>“No.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Count yourself lucky.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what's new?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: The President and Prime Minister kept calling me at all hours of the
                    night, pleading for the Americans to send arms. And they couldn't understand our
                    policy of even-handedness, because they said, “We're under attack. You're
                    supposed to be our friends.”</p>
                <p>Well, after all of this, I guess, Washington decided that maybe I could handle
                    something, so that's when I was told an ambassadorship was in the wings. I was
                    sent to Rome to wait. And then I got my post in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Rome the second time after '60...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Sixty-nine to '73.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sixty-nine, '73. That's when you were Economic
                        Minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, starting out as Commercial Counselor, but for a very short time,
                    then stepping into chief of the economic section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What major problems of a substantive nature did you think
                        important while you were in the job of Economic Minister in Rome?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Well organizational, for one thing. We had all these U.S. Government
                    agency reps—dukes in their duchies. It was a management problem. The Treasury
                    Attach� considered himself quite autonomous, but was in the economic section. We
                    had the Agricultural Attach�, formerly in the Dutch Foreign Service, who was
                    ultra-autonomous, he thought, and we had a Maritime Attach�. We also had a Civil
                    Air Attach�, and a Commercial Counselor. I had to hold staff meetings once a
                    week with that disparate group and give some leadership direction and coherence.
                    There were 56 people in the economic section. Italy's role in the EEC occupied
                    much time.</p>
                <p>But then there were the usual bilateral problems—trade and investment with the
                    Italians, getting the Italians to see the wisdom of our positions, vis a vis the
                    EEC and getting their votes, of course. And visitors. You know, Congressmen and
                    businessmen all the time coming in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Endless visitors, I'm sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: We had the chicken war and the citrus wars with the EEC at that time.
                    The big problems were organization and management and then this
                    leadership-by-a-woman thing that some had trouble adjusting to. The Dutchman,
                    who was the Agricultural Attach�, was impossible. I sort of ignored him. We had
                    a very fine Treasury Attach�, and we worked very, very well together. I was also
                    responsible for policy guidance, the management oversight of economic and
                    commercial work at seven constituent posts—Palermo, Naples, Genoa, Florence,
                    Trieste, Milan, and Turin. I traveled to them for special events—trade fairs,
                    and delegations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Venice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Venice, no. Venice was handled by Trieste. Al Fidel was the Consul
                    General there. We shut down Venice. We kept a beautiful floor on a villa, if I
                    recall, and we had a speedboat there, none of which I took advantage of because
                    if you used it, you had to sort of blow the dust away and sleep on a cot. I
                    didn't go there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm very sympathetic, having tried to run the
                        economic section in London with all the independent sovereignties that you
                        had to contend with. Sometimes they were easy to get along with and
                        sometimes not. I don't think we had a Maritime Attach�.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: They all wanted a minimum of interference, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They wanted support on everything and they didn't want to
                        have to tell you what they were doing. I even had the FBI unit in the

                </p>
                <p>Now, on your appointment as Ambassador to Zambia, what was your state of mind on
                    hearing of it?</p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: As I told you, Graham Martin had called me down and said, “I want to
                    know how you feel. Do you want to be an Ambassador?” I gulped a bit as someone
                    in Washington had said, “You know you're going to be an Ambassador, so why not
                    wait it out in Rome as Commercial Counselor, which is better than in
                    Washington.” So when Martin called me, I countered with, “What do you think?” I
                    almost said, “I have to go home and ask my mother,” which was about what I would
                    have done ten years previous. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A man would say, “I've got to talk to my wife.”
                        [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: I persisted, “What do you think, Mr. Ambassador?” He just leaned back
                    in his chair and shook his head in disbelief. “How could this woman be so dumb,”
                    was written all over his face. Finally, he leaned forward in the chair and eyed
                    me very keenly and said, “I think you can do anything you set your mind to.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's a good comment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: I said, “Well, thank you, Mr. Ambassador. Then I would welcome your
                    recommendation when you go back to Washington.” So the next thing I knew, dear
                    Cleo Noel was on the telephone, calling me from Washington. He was in Personnel
                    then before his fateful Somalia ambassadorship. He said, “Well, Jean, how would
                    you like to go to Zambia?”</p>
                <p>And I inquired, “As what?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Knock it off. As chief of mission, of course.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>I was pretty excited, of course. Some people say, “Endsville, Africa. Why do they
                    send all the career people and women to Africa?” But I thought, “Gee, you know,
                    it's fine. I'll go.” And so I went back to Washington for the usual swearing-in,
                    briefings, and consultations with the academics. Then I went back to Rome to buy
                    a lot of clothes which were totally inappropriate for Zambia. [Laughter]</p>

                <p>[End Tape 1, Side 1] [Begin Tape 1, Side 2]</p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: ...and you think you're God Almighty with that title Ambassador—a
                    strange thing that comes over one. I tried to do it right, blessed myself and
                    flew Zambia Airlines. But before taking off from Rome a funny thing happened.
                    Graham Martin called me down to his office. He said, “I shouldn't be telling you
                    this, but I have to tell you confidentially.”</p>
                <p>There had been a Russian defector in Zambia who had been moved out with a
                    stopover in Rome for some reason. At any rate, the Zambians had given him a
                    passport calling him something like Aaron Freeman, or John Freeman. Graham told
                    me this, reaffirming his keen interest in clandestine things. I got a fright
                    that he might want to introduce me. Then I thought, how very humane for
                    President Kaunda to handle it as he had, why the stop of the defector in Rome. I
                    do not know unless the Zambians were turning him over to the Americans at the
                    Embassy. It was a curious thing that happened just before I went down to
                    Zambia.</p>
                <p>There was strong competition in economic development in Zambia between the
                    Eastern Bloc and the West. Yet, the U.S. had no AID mission. What were the key
                    issues and my duties down there? We were bystanders in this contest being pulled
                    back from assistance in the sixties. What were the key issues and my duties?
                    Primarily to get the Embassy up and really running. I was the third American
                    Ambassador there since 1964. I went down there in '73 and remained for 3-1/2
                    years on assignment. And I was there for the tenth anniversary of independence
                    in '74.</p>
                <p>Zambia was in good economic shape then. Copper prices were up and the oil crisis
                    had yet to arrive. We were a primary target of all those London bankers, City
                    Bank and the rest that were in Africa looking for placement of funds. So we had
                    a steady parade of people wanting to loan money, and sell major equipment
                    (aircraft and transportation) to the government. The major activity in Zambia, I
                    soon learned, was not bilateral economic relations. We had but one American
                    businessman in the whole country and 2,000 American missionaries. Political
                    relations were limited mainly to gaining Zambian support for our positions at
                    the UN.</p>
                <p>Our biggest brief and area of interest, of course, was regional politics in
                    southern Africa. Lusaka was the preeminent political listening post for that
                    entire area: Angola, Mozambique, Rhodesia, Namibia, and the newly independent
                    states of Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland, the BLS countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>We had the freedom fighters and liberation movement leaders from all of those
                    countries. They were exciting times because the South Africans were constantly
                    infiltrating into Rhodesia and Zambia to harass and undermine these political
                    refugees. There were many refugee camps in Zambia. It was important, I felt,
                    that U.S. representatives get to know the leaders of these liberation
                    movements—to have some communication with them so as to be in a position of easy
                    transition once these colonies were free. Mr. Kissinger felt differently, but
                    together with Ambassador Bev Carter in Tanzania we kept up a steady drumbeat,
                    recommending to the Department that early contacts were important. He came to
                    accept our view. He finally authorized communication, but he did it in his own
                    ambiguous style. I believed (with my DCM questioning) that we were given all the
                    authority we needed highly conditional as it was.</p>
                <p>President Kaunda had been offended because he had been invited to the White House
                    by President Nixon, and then brushed off at the last minute, so I thought it
                    important that we...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was he rejected?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: President Nixon changed his mind because he reportedly had other
                    things on his mind in higher priority areas. But you know how sensitive Africans
                    are. The President just canceled the meeting without offering an alternative
                    date. He never reinstated it. It was my hope we could patch this situation up
                    and make amends.</p>
                <p>One of the biggest problems the U.S. had in Zambia was Africa's antagonistic
                    feeling about U.S. intervention in Vietnam. We didn't get a thaw on that until
                    Kissinger negotiated the peace treaty in Paris and until Lyndon Johnson died.
                    Those two events took place within a period of about four days, if I recall. I
                    remember getting a telephone call from President Kaunda. He asked, “Do you have
                    a condolence book for signature at the embassy?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes, we will have one.” I didn't have one.</p>
                <p>The President said, “I would like to come over to express my regrets and
                    condolences.”</p>
                <p>So I said, “And when would that be, Mr. President?” Well, he said he would come
                    over with some of his cabinet members, and that would be at 5:00 that evening
                    and this was something like 11:00 in the morning. So, zip, out with the
                    administrative officer to get a book at a local store, drape President Johnson's
                    picture in black and ready the Embassy lobby and staff.</p>
                <p>President Kaunda came with 14 members of his entourage. There were party members
                    and cabinet members, and the entire lobby was filled with people. He came
                    dressed in black, walked over to the book and signed it, then came to me and
                    shook my hand. The Prime Minister pushed me in the back and said, “You have to
                    say something.” So I remember walking slowly to the stairs and saying something
                    about Lyndon Johnson and his...</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that was done with a lack of enthusiasm?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: No, I was just collecting my thoughts to speak, and I did, on
                    President Johnson's ideals of racial equality, the significance of the peace
                    treaty on Vietnam and our relief to disengage. Anyhow, it went over very well,
                    and the Prime Minister grabbed me and said into my ear in his stage whisper,
                    “That's just what we wanted to hear.” I was comforted. [Laughter] So that was
                    that. But that occasion was a turning point in our bilateral relations. Things
                    became much warmer. It was an entirely different situation from my arrival at
                    post. The Zambians kept me waiting 21 days to present my credentials. The
                    Chinese Ambassador had arrived within a day of my own arrival in Zambia, and he
                    presented credentials within three days. I was kept waiting 21 days to show
                    Zambian displeasure with U.S. engagement in Vietnam. Once at the opening of
                    Parliament, when the President spoke, he broke into tears as he had done on
                    other occasions when talking about the need for peace in the world and his
                    displeasure with U.S. foreign policy in Asia. He was famous for his fluttering a
                    white handkerchief. After the Paris treaty, the President became openly friendly
                    and kind to me as the U.S. representative.</p>
                <p>Turning to U.S. foreign policy objectives in southern Africa. The context was
                    important. You had two Portuguese colonies, Angola and Mozambique, which had
                    been colonies for 500 years. They were on the verge of becoming independent in
                    the mid-seventies when I was posted to Zambia, Angola and Mozambique still have
                    their troubles in new-found independence. Then there was Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe,
                    a runaway colony with its unilateral declaration of independence. And you had
                    all of these freedom fighters making a sanctuary and a haven out of Zambia. It
                    was a messy political situation which absorbed almost as much of my time as an
                    observer than did strictly bilateral issues with Zambia. Indeed the evolving
                    regional situation was often the subject of our bilateral discussions.</p>
                <p>Zambia was in the middle of all this, and the idea was to understand what was
                    going on and to tell the United States about developments and our on site
                    assessment; also what role we might play. It wasn't that we had big economic or
                    trade relations, but politically the United States was looked to as a potential
                    intermediary, a moderator. Indeed, as you know, we did play that role with the
                    Kissinger initiative and the Lancaster House agreements. Sure, the British were
                    much more directly concerned, but we played a catalytic role. It started with
                    our early contacts with the liberation movement leaders and culminated in a turn
                    in U.S. policy (more engaged) enunciated by Kissinger in Lusaka on his first
                    visit to Africa following a UN meeting in Nairobi. So it was the need for the
                    U.S. to understand the southern African situation, the position of the Zambian
                    Government on it, and Kaunda's position as a leader in southern Africa and a
                    leader in Africa. As you know, he's been head of the OAS, and even now he plays
                    a significant catalytic role in South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old a man is he by now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Right now he is, I think, 67. I always looked at President Julius
                    Nyerere as the brains of southern Africa, and Kaunda as the heart of southern
                    Africa. He's a more emotional, sensitive person, less an intellectual than
                    Nyerere.</p>
                <p>So we had to deal with that regional political problem and report on it. I also
                    felt that we might be missing a bet on the economic side. The Chinese were
                    building their railroad from the Indian Ocean into the heart of Zambia. The
                    Russians were busy at their little work trying to get mining concessions and
                    help with a lot of economic assistance, and we were doing nothing in these
                    areas. We were just sort of sitting there observing, getting Zambia to side with
                    our UN positions, etc., but doing precious little to endear ourselves other than
                    carry our responsibilities as world leader. We needed to relate practically.</p>
                <p>So I started something small—even minor—to get the Agricultural Attach� out of
                    Kenya to come and visit Zambia and to work with the private farmers there, to
                    try to work with some of the government people on a very informal practical
                    basis on raising enough food to feed themselves, rather than import. Eventually,
                    I negotiated the first PL 480 loan. After I left, an AID mission was established
                    and more practical assistance given.</p>
                <p>I also felt that security was deteriorating. We had bombings all the
                    time—allegedly due to South African undercover attach�s, or rivalry between
                    liberation factions—one never knew for sure. Indeed, there was one bomb that
                    went off just around the corner from me, across the street. I was always
                    attending funerals of one or another liberation movement member. And so I
                    felt...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was really knocking them off? Was it indeed the South
                        Africans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: You never knew whether it was or it wasn't. Our intelligence was never
                    that good or consistent, but it seemed the South Africans and Rhodesian
                    collaborators were more clever and better equipped; every faction seemed to be
                    doing a little harm to the other, if in opposition.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Then we had a terrible situation develop with a random shooting by Zambian
                    soldiers of some American tourists near Livingston on the Zambezi River. There
                    were two Canadians and two Americans in a tourist group. They were down at
                    Victoria Falls on the Rhodesian side by the river's edge. All of a sudden, a
                    Zambian soldier patrolling on a cliff on the other side went berserk and just
                    shot them up. He killed the two Canadians. They fell into the Zambezi River and
                    crocodiles got them. The two Americans hid behind boulders and rocks on the
                    Rhodesian side. Later they were rescued in the night by Rhodesians and taken to
                    the Wankie coal mine properties. They sent me a note telling me exactly what had
                    happened.</p>
                <p>The truth of their statement, I mean, their eyewitness account, was totally
                    different from what the Zambians were claiming in the local press. So I had this
                    problem of conscience, how do you deal with that sort of thing, or should you? I
                    took an African colleague into confidence. He advised silence. But contrary to
                    his advice I sought out the President's private secretary, gave him a copy of
                    the victim's letter and said I thought the President should hear it from the
                    other side. Naturally I had no reason to go public. Nothing further was said by
                    the government.</p>
                <p>The occasion resulted in close collaboration with the Canadians who had just
                    established a mission. They hadn't even secure communications so I invited them
                    to use ours. They were pouring a lot of aid in to Zambia and so the Canadian
                    parliament seized upon this attack on their citizens. They wanted to cut off all
                    aid to Zambia. “They're killing our people,” was the angry position of the
                    Canadian public.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Oh, 1974, I believe. So I told Ambassador Broadbridge, my Canadian
                    colleague, that I thought that, since they had suffered loss of life, they
                    should go first in seeking indemnification from the Zambians and that we would
                    follow depending on results of their efforts. It was messy, because the Zambians
                    didn't want to pay for the damage that they had done, but we finally did get a
                    monetary settlement. It was important, I thought, that they recognize this
                    violation of international law. Whether they could afford it or not, I felt they
                    just had to pay something and learn how to be a responsible world community.
                    [Laughter] The two Americans lost time off from their jobs, income as well as
                    the cost of their incomplete round-the-world travel and medical expenses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If there's a price on it, it impresses a little more. It's
                        like the two by four on the mule.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: The Zambians screamed in objection. “How can we do this? Our own
                    citizens—Zambians—are being shot up all the time on the border.” That was true.
                    There were all sorts of booby traps down there, planted either by Rhodesians,
                    South Africans or both. But the Zambians feared a deluge of monetary claims from
                    Zambian relatives.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's just normal African social life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Right, I told the Zambians, “Well, that's your problem, you know.” The
                    Zambians countered that it would set a precedent. “We'll have debate.”</p>
                <p>“That's your problem. In all justice there were two Americans who saved for an
                    around-the-world tour. They lost their tour, their savings, and six months out
                    of work because of injuries.” Anyhow, the Zambians paid up.</p>
                <p>To improve security we got the U.S. Marines in. After that I set about getting
                    the Zambian Foreign Minister to visit the U.S. in preparation—I hoped—for a
                    visit from President Kaunda—long postponed since Nixon days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You hadn't had Marines in your Embassy before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: No, absolutely not. The Zambians were against it; had even—some years
                    earlier—ruled against an Air Attach� shuttling between Mauritius and Zambia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Eventually, I got the Zambian Foreign Minister to the U.S. and a visit
                    with Kissinger. Finally, we got Kaunda to the White House where he promptly said
                    all the wrong things as regards U.S. disregard for the injustices of southern
                    Africa—”here is the America of Washington and Lincoln, the champion of democracy
                    of yesteryear, etc.” That made Kissinger furious and—believe it or not—I was
                    held responsible. To this day when Kissinger sees me, he calls me, “My nemesis.”
                    [Laughter] From him I consider this an accolade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He fired me, too [Laughter] He didn't fire you, but he
                        fired me.</hi>

                <p>WILKOWSKI: He tried to by telephone but Africa is a long way from Washington.
                    Those were pretty exciting, heady times. Well, okay, Zambia ends, I came back to
                    the United States under a few clouds, which we could discuss privately. I don't
                    know who saved my skin and protected me from the Secretary but someone did and
                    I'm grateful. As usual, there were no assignments ready for me—a bad sign. If
                    your transfer happens to coincide with an opening at some post, fine. That's the
                    Foreign Service. I became a diplomat-in-residence at Occidental College, which
                    was hardly Siberia, but it was not an immediate second ambassadorship. But
                    that's how the Foreign Service works more often than not, unless there's been a
                    lot of buttering-up with the in-group.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, I did a lot of lecturing. I did over a hundred lectures out
                    there, as well as being available to consult with students, faculty or
                    alumni.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Primarily on Africa, or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, southern Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Southern Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: I also recruited for the State Department. That was very interesting
                    because I lectured up and down California and around the United States, too. I
                    made some very interesting trips.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was from '74, '75?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Later. I was in Zambia from 1973-77. Oh, I forgot to tell you another
                    “accomplishment,” referred to earlier in passing. After getting Kaunda to the
                    States, I got Kissinger to Zambia to make the important policy statement,
                    shifting U.S. “negligence” to “concern and involvement” in the regional problems
                    of southern Africa. I also got Duke Ellington to Zambia. [Laughter]
                    Similarity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be easier.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, Kissinger made a momentous speech in Lusaka on U.S. foreign
                    policy in southern Africa. To me it was the answer to all of those urgent cables
                    I had been sending. If you read Helen Kitchen's monograph—she considers that
                    speech a turning point in our policy in southern Africa, too. She's with the
                    Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>
                <p>The U.S. had been utterly rhetorical before, just words, words, words on justice,
                    majority rule, and so forth. But eventually Kissinger put his shoulder to the
                    Lancaster House agreements and got down to work on them and eventually there was
                    movement on Rhodesia becoming independent Zimbabwe. It's true that my successors
                    did far more in participating in negotiations in London than I ever thought of
                    doing, but I felt satisfied that in my mission we laid the groundwork toward a
                    significant change in policy on southern Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you got the Secretary of State to speak up on the
                        African question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Exactly, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When he was Secretary of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes. His visit to Zambia was a big success, even though he didn't see
                    hippopotamus down at the Zambezi River and Victoria Falls. Of course, he held me
                    personally responsible for that, blaming me for “too many FSOs” in the boat we
                    provided, even though my niece (visiting) and I were the only others on board
                    plus his phalanx of Secret Service (the real overload).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He does have occasional touches of humor. You should have
                        said we didn't have hippopotamus on our payroll.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Bill, he might have gotten personal at that point. I ran that
                    risk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could ask the CIA. They got all kinds of people on the
                        payroll.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understood, way back when—and I guess it's
                        declassifiable now—but way back when I had the British desk in the '60s,
                        after I came back from Canada, I had British, Canadian, Scandinavian, Irish,
                        Maltese and West Indies. I understood then that we had been providing
                        various forms of subvention for quite a number of African leaders, including
                        Kaunda. I wouldn't ask you to confirm or deny that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: No, I simply couldn't comment on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was widely said, should we say, around town that
                        this was the case.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: I know. We also had some very, very touchy...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure the British were doing it, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: ...problems with Angola and arms to Angola, if you recall, and I had a
                    terrible dustup with Dick Clark. It's funny. When I have problems with people
                    like that, I immediately forget their names. Our Assistant Secretary of
                    State—Dick Moose. I could tell you a horror story about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that the older or the younger Moose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Oh, younger Moose, I think. He was Assistant Secretary of State for
                    African Affairs. He had been Under Secretary for Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His father had the African division, and I had a hell of a
                        fight with him back in 1946 or '47 over the French controls on currency in
                        Morocco, because the Moroccans claimed that by our treaty with the sultan,
                        going back to, I don't know, the Monroe Administration or Adams or somebody,
                        that we did not have to comply with French currency regulations. And, of
                        course, the French were responsible for currency because it was part of the
                        franc zone under the European community under the Marshall Plan. And this
                        eventually ended up with a real dustup in court and all over the place by
                        Americans who had gone into business in Morocco and could see this
                        loophole.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>What they were doing was bringing quantities of things that the French were not
                    importing for currency reasons. They'd bring them into Morocco and then sell
                    them in France for francs, and then turn around and buy more dollars and go
                    ahead, you know. That was a real loophole in the French system. Mr. Moose ran
                    the African division, and Doug MacArthur and Elim O'Shaughnessy were running WE
                    in Europe and I was in commercial policy, and we had periodic meetings with Mr.
                    Moose. We never could dislodge him from this position.</p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Well, I never knew the father, but I had quite enough of the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was so dedicated to Africa, you know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, I had quite enough of the son. However, I saw Dick Moose at a
                    meeting a couple of years ago and he'd aged tremendously. His hair was snow
                    white, and he was reasonably civil. But I felt this was another situation of
                    unfairness where people are in position of authority and use too much of it. I,
                    myself, may have been guilty of this at times. You begin to use your authority
                    carelessly and at times can be excessively harsh on other people. It's just the
                    wrong way to go. You only become less harsh, I think, the older you get. It's
                    just too bad they don't use us now in our stage of grand wisdom now that we're
                    senior citizens. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The argument with Moose was about Angola?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: It was about meeting Kaunda. Do you want to hear this story?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I think it's relevant, important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Well, it's simply a problem that every Ambassador runs into. Along
                    comes a Senator, Dick Clark from Iowa, and Dick Moose, Assistant Secretary of
                    State for African Affairs, and Clark wanted to see Kaunda alone. I said,
                    “Goodness, Senator, this is going to be very awkward. This is the eve of
                    President Kaunda's historic meeting with Prime Minister Botha from South Africa
                    at Victoria Falls. It's very important for the State Department to know what
                    he's thinking about at this time and what he intends to do. I'm sorry, but I
                    made the appointment for both of us and Kaunda expects both of us. If you want
                    to meet with him privately, you can raise the question.”</p>
                <p>“No,” said Clark, “you have to call him first and tell him that I want to meet
                    with him alone.”</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>And I said, “Well, we're just about a half-hour before the meeting. It would be
                    rude to call. I think we should just go through with it, and you can play it by
                    ear.” So then Moose and Clark buzzed their heads together in the corner, and
                    came back and allowed we should all go. So we set forth in the car, flags
                    flying, over to State House, and got in and went to the meeting. By the way,
                    Moose, without even asking, brought his wife along!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To this meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: To this meeting. So there was Moose and his wife; Dick Clark; Mark
                    Chona, the President's Executive Assistant, and myself. Everything was chummy,
                    and we were into the meeting about 10, 15 minutes when Moose stood. He just got
                    up on his feet and said, “Well, Mr. President, I know you'll want to meet with
                    the Senator alone. You have important things to discuss because you'll be
                    meeting with Prime Minister Botha tomorrow.” By the way, it was scheduled in a
                    railway car perched perilously over Victoria Falls, halfway in Rhodesia, half in
                    Zambia—the Zambians laughingly called it the “Chattanigger Choo-Choo,” which I
                    thought was hysterical. [Laughter] Chattanigger Choo-Choo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: So, Moose stood up, and Mark Chona, who was taking notes, looked
                    puzzled at me. He raised his two open hands to me with an expression of, “What
                    does this mean?” I shrugged my shoulders, “Beats me.”</p>
                <p>“And so we will leave you,” said Moose dramatically as he and his wife left. I
                    sat there glued to the chair. Dick Clark glowered at me, and Kaunda said, “Mr.
                    Senator, I want you to know we never have any secrets from the American
                    Ambassador, so let us continue with this meeting.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Saved by the other side. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: So we continued with the meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He could have always found out from the Zambians
                        afterwards what happened that day.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were dead right. That's what Jim Akins did with
                        Kissinger in Saudi Arabia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Exactly. It happens all the time in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had a better point than Akins. The Secretary of
                        State can say, “I'm going to see this guy alone.” He's got every right to do
                        that, because you're working for the Secretary of State. And you were
                        working for Moose—sort of—but the Senator had no business to instruct
                        you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: That's right. I recall what happened after the meeting, there was a
                    brief private session as they walked down the hall. I must say, Kaunda was
                    gallant; he always was. He had that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a decent guy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, very decent. Even when I returned last year en route back from a
                    business trip to South Africa I had to visit Zambia to evaluate a VITA
                    development project and Kaunda had a working breakfast for me. It was very
                    cordial, very nice. He's a very decent man. He gave me his picture, signed it,
                    and I have it.</p>
                <p>Well, that was Zambia. I think I've covered everything. And after that, I did the
                    diplomat-in-residence stint and ended up quite nicely there. Got an honorary
                    degree with—oh, goodness. Who was Under Secretary of State under Jimmy Carter
                    with the law firm? Christopher. Warren Christopher. He was on the board of
                    Occidental, so I had some very good associations there with the Council of
                    Foreign Relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Christopher's a nice man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes. I did some lecturing with the Council, Shirley Hoffstedler was
                    also on the board of Occidental. A lot of very interesting people. Also, I had
                    fun counseling students. I love working with students. In fact, I've been
                    running a series of interns from Georgetown over at VITA, and that was the young
                    lady who was here with her parents yesterday.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a good college.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: After that, Carol Laise, then Director General of the Foreign Service,
                    called from Washington and said, “Jean, what do you think about Nicaragua?” I
                    guess this shouldn't be public.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Who?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I think it's all right. Sure. That was not a
                        classified conversation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: No. “What do you think about Nicaragua?” And I said, “As what?”</p>
                <p>She said, “Well, we'd like to send you down there to work with Somoza. [Tape
                    turned off.]</p>
                <p>So Carol thought that Nicaragua would be a good assignment, and I said, “Gee,
                    Carol, after Zambia?”</p>
                <p>She said, “Sure, why not? You know Central America, you know Spanish.” And she
                    said, “What's more, Jean, we've got some problems down there with Somoza.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I can believe that. He used to come over to Honduras all the time and
                    swagger about, even boss me around when I was charg�.”</p>
                <p>She said, “You know, some of our Ambassadors have been prone to get into bed with
                    Somoza, and we're sure you won't do that.”</p>
                <p>And I said jokingly, “Oh, Carol, I wouldn't be so sure about that. All kidding
                    aside, the man's a bully, a tyrant, no respecter of U.S. representatives, and
                    his behavior when he had come to visit his 'compadres' in Honduras was something
                    awful. Carol, I'm telling you, before six months are up, I will either be
                    declared persona non grata, or I will ask to be relieved and have to resign,
                    because I am not going to be bossed around by that man.”</p>
                <p>She said, “That's why we want you.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't know this. It was a great thought. It was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Frankly, I said, “I don't know what policy you want me to articulate,
                    but I really don't think it's the best assignment, Carol. If you've got anything
                    else, fine.”</p>
                <p>Well, because of this I was later called up by Phil Habib, then Under Secretary,
                    and harshly asked, “What do you mean refusing an assignment?” I tried to
                    explain.</p>
                <p>He said, “That's no excuse.” I was surprised, because Phil Habib gained his
                    reputation for being outspoken and calling the shots as he saw them.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>But Carol came back to me, and said, “Do you know Father Ted Hesburgh, the
                    president of Notre Dame?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Of course, by reputation.”</p>
                <p>She said, “How would you like to work with him? We're thinking of nominating him
                    as Head of Delegation of the Science and Technology Conference.”</p>
                <p>I said that would be very interesting.</p>
                <p>So she said, “Well, he needs a backup person, U.S. coordinator in the Department.
                    It's a three-year assignment getting this conference together.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Okay,” and she said, “You know, you retain the title of Ambassador.” So
                    that was three years off and on at the UN, but working out of an office in
                    Washington and conferences in various parts of the world. But it was a very
                    interesting assignment because, as you know, science and technology is not the
                    exclusive province of the U.S. Government. It's 50 percent of the private
                    sector, or more. That meant rallying the support of corporations to help us
                    consider policy options. We must have had 200 businessmen working with us. We
                    had 30 some-odd conferences around the United States even before taking on the
                    UN and all its meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was at one or two of those, yes. We had contact because
                        I was with a business organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: That's true. So that was all very, very interesting. As a matter of
                    fact, it was really through that conference that I got to know some of the
                    corporate people who were on the advisory board to the UN Secretary General of
                    the conference. As a result of that, I would say, and probably through some
                    earlier connections in Milan, I later hooked up with the board of a
                    multinational food company. Every time Hesburgh came to town, which was once a
                    quarter, we'd make the rounds of the President, the Congress, the Senate and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is a good man to work with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's a nice man, isn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Definitely. A very decent sort of a person, knows everybody, and they
                    know him. So if you really wanted to know who's who in Washington, he is the
                    key. He'd want to see certain people, so I would set up the appointments and we
                    would go. He's a very interesting man. As the result of my labors, I received an
                    honorary degree from Notre Dame, which I prize very, very much because I had
                    some interesting classmates there. Gorbachev's science advisor, David
                    Rockefeller, Coretta King and other notables were in my class of honorees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to college? I forget.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: I went to St. Mary-of-the-Woods College for my B.A., and the
                    University of Wisconsin for my M.A., then Berkeley with Louise.</p>
                <p>That's about it, Bill. That takes you through what my mother would say was my
                    “hellish career.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it would be good if you'd go back and—I don't know
                        whether we had this on tape or not. I'd like to get your comments on women
                        and men, again, in the Foreign Service. I mean the point of the
                        complementarity of the approach by women and men and the fact that this
                        should give the Government and the Service a more comprehensive picture than
                        it would get simply from, say, a total male reporting or a total female
                        reporting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes, I made a statement on that many years ago to a Department
                    historian in a book called Women in the Foreign Service. The author was Homer
                    Caulkins. Back in the '50s or '60s, I felt as I still feel now.</p>
                <p>I think that men generally tend to be more intellectual, more analytical, but
                    it's very hard to generalize. I think women can be that way, too. There are many
                    intellectual women in the professions these days. But I think women have a
                    special compassionate quality, a certain sensitivity not as obvious in men. It's
                    the caring-type thing, the nurturing aspect. It's built into women, I think,
                    because, after all, they do bear children, they are mothers, and so they see
                    things from an emotional point of view. I don't mean they are emotional, but
                    when you look at a problem and analyze it, it isn't always 100%
                    intellectual—people's motivations and feelings are involved, also personal
                    experiences. Women are especially sensitive to this.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>There is this other aspect to it, like the shooting of the Canadians and
                    Americans at Victoria Falls in Zambia. How do you handle that thing? It's not
                    all intellectual and analytical. How do you handle the eyewitness testimony when
                    it comes in? Do you discard it, or do you try to get at the truth of the thing
                    and let the Zambian Government know that this is what really happened? Because
                    people experienced and described things. And that's the honest, true statement
                    of the situation. Now I don't know whether that's a woman's point of view or
                    whether men would feel the same way about it. They may feel identically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think people would react identically on that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: They could react identically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If their business was government or making sure the facts
                        were right. But I was interested in your comment that—I think it's very
                        important personally—that you always take account of the intuitive factor.
                        Intuition is a very important element in analysis, because not everything is
                        susceptible to a perfectly, plain, rational, factual analysis. Bottom line,
                        you got to have a hunch about things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes. And men have hunches, and they're very good at them, too. But
                    women have strong intuitions, also. Analyzing people, and their reactions and
                    knowing how to deal with them, also timing are very important, especially in
                    diplomacy. There's a right time, and a wrong time to make proposals, drive for a
                    negotiated settlement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Both men and women can have a good feel for timing. Whether women are
                    better or not, I don't know, possibly. Believe me, I don't want to rely too
                    heavily on this and say, “I attribute my success in the Foreign Service to the
                    fact that I'm a woman and I'm intuitive.” No, not that at all. We have different
                    degrees of intuition, different degrees of intellectualism and analysis. I think
                    when men and women do talk over a problem and how they are going to try and
                    resolve that problem with individuals, groups of people, or nations, I think the
                    results of such collaboration can be good, but the perspective and experience
                    are richer. The old saying, two heads are better than one still holds; each
                    brings separate gifts and talents. Results are bound to be better. Men and women
                    have learned a lot over recent years in how to collaborate professionally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's like a second opinion.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very important, and I think it should be, you know,
                        factored in. And as the Service increasingly takes in women (at a rough
                        annual percentage of 30, I understand) the more it's going to get
                        automatically factored in. Now you can have some men who are very sensitive
                        and intuitive, and you can have some women who are as cold as ice and
                        basically intellectual analysts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've always felt intuition is important in my own case,
                        because I get hunches about things and I feel intuitively about certain
                        people and so forth. You know, we used to kid around when we were serving in
                        London about this factor. We called it the Celtic view, this is the way the
                        Scots, the Irish and the Welsh look at things. Whereas the English think
                        they're being highly analytical, which they aren't necessarily, really. They
                        may kid themselves. As for those generalizations, they're all fun, but
                        perhaps not too reliable as generalizations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: I, too, urge caution on such generalizations though acting on hunches
                    is important to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you need to deal with, the complexities of foreign
                        relations these days, is to use all the talent you've got.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I felt this especially when I was working in the CIA.
                        I felt frequently the human element and the human reactive element wouldn't
                        get incorporated. As was once said, “If somebody tried to put the whole
                        Vietnam situation (when we were in the middle of it) on a computer, how
                        would, you know...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Won't work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they couldn't find any place to factor in the
                        Buddhists. They didn't fit in the computer, but you couldn't do Vietnam

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: You know, imagination is something else. Now I can't say that men
                    generally are more or less imaginative. After all, men dominate Hollywood, don't
                    they, and show business. You have some pretty imaginative things there. And
                    play-writing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like my brother-in-law.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: That's who I was thinking of, too. But I think that if I want to look
                    at some reasons—and I haven't really stopped long enough nor did I prepare for
                    this, to set down qualities that helped me in the Foreign Service. In the first
                    part of my career—one third to one half of my career—I think I was very shy and
                    very deferential because I was a woman and the times were more structured and
                    conventional also. I didn't want to make a lot of mistakes. I wanted to succeed.
                    But I think I curbed my imagination, yet in time I found that my imagination was
                    probably one of my stronger points.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course. Why not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: That I do have ideas. I think I'm pretty good at ideas, and I think
                    I'm good at making relationships. Certainly in the last part of my career, I
                    think that was exceedingly helpful to me. And, here again, if you have to score
                    men relative to women on a range of consistent qualities, I think you're on
                    risky ground, but it's something worth thinking about. Women may tend to be more
                    imaginative, but again, generalizations can be dangerous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, I think that's a fair point, and I think that
                        it's important to be able to stand back and look at a situation or problem
                        and say, “Now let me see what if here, and what if there, and so forth.” You
                        do contingency planning this way and everybody should. I think it's very
                        important to have this allowed for by people. I felt this in our analysis. I
                        got very interested in the CIA and working on the national intelligence
                        estimates, and they still have me on their rolls. Once in a while they call
                        me over. Sometimes these estimates are done entirely too much on the basis
                        of what they used to call “shoebox data,” and now the shoebox data are all
                        in a computer somewhere. People don't always stop to think about, “Well,
                        what about the human element?” What's in that guy's mind? I mean, what is he
                        thinking of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: You certainly have to be able to fly by the seat of your pants in the
                    Foreign Service and think on your feet, often while you're running, or
                    flying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, of course you do. And you do in any creative
                        profession which is dealing with a whole lot of unknowns at one time, which
                        you always are in the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: And you're dealing more with people than you are with data. You're
                    dealing a lot with data, but it's how people will act and react. People are
                    very, very important. We're getting into a subject which I think is what David
                    Newsom has written on in a book on the talents and qualities needed by any
                    aspirant to the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: David has a lot of wisdom and he puts it down very
                        well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Yes. He's a good writer, and that's another qualification of a Foreign
                    Service Officer. You have got to have some sense of how to put sentences
                    together, make points, and argue cogently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've got to be able to express yourself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I shared your experience of being a charg�, because my Ambassador died and I was
                    charg� for about four or five months after. He was a political appointee and
                    died just before elections. So nobody was going to appoint anybody until after
                    the new election. And then Livy Merchant came back to Canada. He'd been there
                    before. He looked at me and said, “You do it.” He did a lot of other things that
                    interested him, or special errands for President Kennedy or whatever, but he
                    just said, “You do it,” so I did it.</p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: So you ran the mission?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I ran the mission, in effect, for about a year and a
                        half. We had a few minor crises. It was interesting, but nothing as exciting
                        as you got in Honduras.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Well, I'll never forget those Salvadoran planes coming over, the doors
                    opening and bombs being kicked out. I couldn't believe it. It was like seeing a
                    movie. And then going to the airport to receive emergency supplies on those big
                    cargo planes to help nearly 60,000 refugees. I've got some pictures there out at
                    the airport where I had a run-in with the President's wife. You know, she said,
                    “These relief supplies can be just for Salvadorans. (The Hondurans had rounded
                    up and incarcerated them.) It's going to be all for Hondurans.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Look. It's a crisis here. Hondurans have created the crisis. There are
                    people who are starving.”Q: Well, that world in Central America must be pretty
                    awful.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: I'm still with it. I serve on the board of a non-profit organization
                    with programs in other regions. It's Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA).
                    We were recently asked to go down there on an AID program and train the Contras
                    in carpentry and automobile repair, auto mechanics, plumbing, electricians and
                    so forth. It was a matter put to the board. I just couldn't see our getting
                    involved in such a politicized thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You couldn't see it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: I think those of us primarily in economic development tend to follow
                    the flag a little bit too much. We're already in Afghanistan. We're running farm
                    equipment out of Pakistan into Afghanistan to help restore farming. We're being
                    asked to go into Poland and Hungary. But running into Honduras and training
                    Contras on Honduran soil so that they could apply and compete for jobs—even
                    temporarily— against Hondurans? Maybe. It didn't strike me as being the most
                    brilliant opportunity for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can see why they thought of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Sure. It's easy money from AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, it's a thought that comes naturally, but whether
                        a private organization wants to have to explain that to its board is another
                        question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: VITA prides itself in being apolitical. Anyhow, do you know of anybody
                    who would like to take that job as chairman of the board of VITA? [Laughter]
                    Shall we conclude on that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, we'll conclude on that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKOWSKI: Very well.</p>
