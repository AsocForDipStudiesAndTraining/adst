                <p>DAVID G. NES</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Dayton Mak </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 28, 1992</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with David Nes at his home in Owings
                        Mills, Maryland. Today is April 28, 1992. David, first of all, I wonder if
                        you would be good enough to give us a little bit of your background...where
                        you were raised, went to school, and particularly how you happened to become
                        interested in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NES: Perhaps I should begin by saying that the Nes family moved to York County,
                    Pennsylvania in 1731, and we remained there as a family up to my generation. So
                    in effect, my background is of a small Pennsylvania town. I was very fortunate
                    in getting four years of high school in Baltimore at the Gilman School where I
                    was a five-day boarder and then moved on to Princeton University.</p>
                <p>My Foreign Service career really began in the sophomore year when I had the
                    burden of a very extensive pre-med course in order to follow in the footsteps of
                    three generations of Neses who had been physicians. I took an elective in modern
                    European history given by a very popular and celebrated professor known as
                    Buzzer Hall. I became so enchanted with history that I dropped the medicine,
                    went to summer school to get the necessary preliminary courses to major in
                    history. This change was approved by the Dean, so I went on to obtain my degree
                    in history from Princeton.</p>
                <p>This type of background persuaded me that the Foreign Service would be the best
                    place to pursue these interests and particularly the diplomatic field. Princeton
                    at that time did not provide certain courses that were necessary to pass the
                    Foreign Service exams which were considerably more extensive, including essay
                    questions on international law, world trade and finance, etc. So I took a year
                    at the Graduate School at Harvard in order to fill in these particular gaps.</p>
                <p>Afterward, having been interviewed by Sumner Wells, he suggested that in order to
                    get rid of the Ivy school image, that I obviously possessed, I should dirty my
                    hands by getting on a daily newspaper and working for a year before taking the
                    Foreign Service exams. I did this. I worked as a district reporter on the
                    Baltimore Sun for approximately a year covering primarily murders, rapes,
                    robberies, fires, accidents, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I then took the Foreign Service exam just before Pearl Harbor. I passed them. But
                    after Pearl Harbor, there were no positions opening up abroad; so I was assigned
                    to the so-called Special Division in the State Department which had the primary
                    responsibility of handling problems incident to the outbreak of war...evacuation
                    of citizens, guarantee of strategic materials, etc.</p>
                <p>However, after about a year of this, I asked for military leave of absence, which
                    was granted, and joined the Army as a private. I got NCO training at Ft. Sill
                    and then officer training there, eventually ending up as a volunteer in the Mars
                    Task Force which was engaged in the Burma Campaign. I served as a Pack Artillery
                    Battery C.O. until the end of hostilities.</p>
                <p>At the close of the war, I came back in late 1945, and the State Department
                    reinstated me without any trouble and more-or-less asked what type of post I
                    would like. Well, I had picked up a little bit of malaria and other things, so I
                    said, “I would really like a rather cool post.” As a result I was assigned to
                    Glasgow, Scotland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They couldn't have done better than that could they, for
                        that type of post? I notice that you had been Assistant Director of the
                        Executive Secretariat in Washington and on a Trieste Task Force. Can you
                        tell us a bit about this Trieste Task Force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NES: This all happened because during my time in Paris (1949- 52), the last half
                    of it, I was special assistant to Ambassador David Bruce. When he came back to
                    the Department as Under Secretary to sort of manage things during the transition
                    of Administrations from Truman to Eisenhower, he brought me back with him as his
                    Special Assistant in the Department.</p>
                <p>After the transition, I was more-or-less out of a job and assigned to the
                    Executive Secretariat and to a little task force dealing with Trieste which was
                    headed by Clare Boothe Luce. She was not only a brilliant lady, but very
                    attractive to boot! We worked with the Yugoslavs and the Italians on a final
                    settlement of what was a very serious bone of contention at that time between
                    Italy and Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That I believe was primarily who owned Trieste?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NES: It was, it was territorial. It was whether Trieste was Yugoslav or
                    Italian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1954, you went on from there as Counselor and
                        Deputy Chief of Mission in Libya...long before Qadhafi. What were the
                        problems you had there, and what was your environment at that time in
                        Tripoli?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>NES: That assignment really illustrates that it helps to be in the right place at
                    the right time. After my short State Department experience, all of a sudden I
                    was offered the DCM job in Tripoli and as a very junior officer—I think I was
                    class-4 at the time—it looked like a tremendous opportunity, and it turned out
                    to be just that.</p>
                <p>Our primary interests in Libya revolved around Wheelus Field which was not only a
                    mammoth US air base but a training base for NATO. Libya provided the most
                    wonderful training areas for aerial bombardment, close support, etc. because
                    this could take place not only in the vast desert areas where nobody would be
                    injured, but also in the Mediterranean, off the coast. Squadrons of NATO planes
                    would come down from time to time and rotate through there for training.</p>
                <p>It was also at this time that oil was discovered and the Libyan government very
                    wisely formed a group of experts from the major oil companies to draft a
                    petroleum treaty, or law, under which the major companies could apply for
                    concessions. The Libyans were clever enough to realize that if the companies
                    actually did this, they would end up not only squabbling among themselves, but
                    the end result would probably be an arrangement fairly satisfactory for
                    Libya—which it turned out to be. Of course at that time King Idris was king, and
                    Ben Halim was Prime Minister. (Incidentally the latter still lives in
                    considerable luxury in Paris.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any other problems, other than the oil and
                        Wheelus Field? Was the local population reasonably friendly at that
                        particular point? There was a Palestinian oriented...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NES: They were only Palestinian-oriented in that there were many well educated,
                    intellectual Palestinians in Libya. In fact they formed the core, the basis, of
                    the Libya Supreme Court because most of them were lawyers. But, the Palestinian
                    issue was virtually an unknown, or at least it didn't play a major part in Libya
                    thinking.</p>
                <p>They were particularly worried at the time about Egypt which, of course,
                    historically has always had some coveted eyes on Libya. They sent to Tripoli as
                    ambassador their top intelligence officer who later became a very good friend of
                    mine in Egypt when he was Foreign Minister. His name was Mahmoud Riad. We
                    watched him very closely and he, of course, was a problem for our CIA as far as
                    his activities were concerned.</p>
                <p>I would say that we didn't really have any major problems in Libya at that time.
                    It was a very friendly country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By 1956 you left Tripoli and came back to Washington and
                        became Desk Officer for Korean Affairs and then Military Affairs Adviser in
                        the African Bureau. What were some of the problems you encountered
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>NES: It was really quite a startling assignment to have experience in North
                    Africa and Paris and all of a sudden to be in charge of Korean affairs during a
                    very tricky period in our relationship with both Korea, Japan and, of course,
                    North Korea. That is the way the Department operates! Our Assistant Secretary
                    was Walter Robertson, a charming gentleman, very tough. We got along very
                    well.</p>
                <p>The principal issue that I was involved in was the introduction of nuclear
                    weapons into South Korea in order to save a considerable amount of money which
                    would have been used to station there two or three more divisions. It was
                    estimated that if we equipped our artillery with nuclear warheads, we would be
                    able to reduce our forces very considerably—which is what happened. I gather
                    from the press today that those nuclear warheads have just recently been
                    withdrawn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you enjoy that assignment in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NES: Well, I did, but I really felt I was unqualified—a fish out of water,
                    dealing with the Far East. At that time the Bureau of African Affairs was just
                    being created under Julius Holmes, who was a friend of mine. He asked if I would
                    agree to transfer from the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs to the new African
                    Bureau as Military Affairs Adviser which would deal with all the various bases
                    we had in Africa at that time...in Morocco, Libya, Ethiopia, etc. I said that I
                    would be delighted, so I moved over and worked under Satterthwaite, who was the
                    Assistant Secretary, and Joe Palmer, who was the Deputy Assistant Secretary, for
                    a very happy year-and-a-half.</p>
                <p>It enabled me to visit all the northern coast of Africa and our various military
                    bases. Of course I found Morocco very attractive and put in a little work on the
                    side trying to get assigned there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in 1959, you did get assigned there as DCM. Back into
                        the swim of North Africa, so to speak. You were there until 1962. Who was
                        your Ambassador at the time and what did you do there? How did you like
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NES: It was a wonderful three year assignment. I had three excellent Chiefs of
                    Mission. Phil Bonsal to begin with. He felt a little bit out of place since he
                    was a Latin American expert. He was succeeded by Charlie Yost, who, of course,
                    went on from there to become our head of delegation to the United Nations. He,
                    in turn, was succeeded by a political appointee, Mr. John Ferguson who was
                    excellent, charming with a lovely wife, and with whom I worked very well. He was
                    particularly easy to work with because being inexperienced in running an
                    Embassy, he turned everything pretty much over to me and conducted the
                    diplomatic side of things at which he was very adept.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>It was a very, very happy assignment. Mohammad V was the king. He died under very
                    sudden and curious circumstances during an operation for a very minor deviated
                    septum. Many people thought he had been done away with. He was succeeded by his
                    son, Hassan II who was his Chief of Staff at the time.</p>
                <p>During my tour, they had that terrible earthquake in Agadir where we sent down
                    ships from the Mediterranean Fleet. Battalions of engineers came from Germany in
                    order to help save as many people as we could. There were about 10,000 deaths
                    all together. It was a hell of a thing.</p>
                <p>The primary interests in Morocco were our three air bases and one navy
                    communications base. It is very interesting that, as is the usual custom, when
                    President Eisenhower decided to visit Morocco I was sent up to join him in
                    Madrid and come down on Air Force I and to brief him on both the protocol he was
                    to face and the substantive issues which the air bases were paramount. He proved
                    to be a far more intelligent, quick, knowledgeable person than the press had led
                    us to believe. I was very impressed with him.</p>
                <p>On the plane, he turned to his Chief of Staff and asked how much longer the air
                    bases would be used for the bombers presently stationed there and was told about
                    two years. He said immediately, “I will tell the King that we are going to get
                    out in two years.” And that was it.</p>
                <p>It was a fascinating and beautiful assignment. We had a chance to visit every
                    province in the Kingdom at one time or another. I would say that it was probably
                    one of the real highlights of our career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there who in the Moroccan government did
                        you deal with and in what language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NES: French influence was still very strong. Almost all the educated elite in
                    Morocco spoke French. That was the language which I used with the Foreign
                    Office, the Foreign Minister, with the Chef de Cabinet, with the King. Access to
                    all of these people for a DCM, particularly if he were Charg� d'Affaires, which
                    was often the case since we had three ambassadors come and go, was very easy and
                    extremely cordial.</p>
                <p>The only problem with our political reporting there was that we did feel it
                    essential that we follow whatever activities were being undertaken by the
                    so-called Left, which was a labor union. Its leaders had, of course, been
                    trained in France and were of communist orientation. In maintaining contact with
                    those leaders we did, from time to time, get into trouble with the Palace which
                    felt that we should remain aloof.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NES: I would say very little. Algeria was the key foreign issue. It was during my
                    tenure in Rabat that Algeria received its independence in accord with the Evian
                    Treaty. It is interesting that Ben Bella—who, of course, headed up the FLN at
                    that time—I had dealt with quietly and secretly in Tripoli, and I knew him. So
                    when he flew into Morocco on his way back to Algeria (he flew in actually on an
                    American Air Force plane because he was afraid of the French), I was designated
                    to go down to our air base at Nouasser and greet him. So Algeria was our
                    principal interest and Palestine very little.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then I see that in 1963 you went to London as US
                        diplomatic representative at the Imperial Defense College. Would you tell us
                        a bit about the Imperial Defense College and how you enjoyed being
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NES: That was certainly a plum assignment as those of my colleagues who had that
                    chance will confirm. The Defense College is a little bit like our National War
                    College except at a slightly more senior rank and a little more general in its
                    approach to the education of senior officers. The level of officers was
                    Brigadier or above in the Army and Air Marshal in the Air Force, the age 40-50.
                    The British Government—I think, with an arrangement with President
                    Eisenhower—asked that we provide a representative from our Foreign Service, the
                    Army, Navy and the Air Force. And so we did. We were four Americans each year in
                    a class of about 65.</p>
                <p>These 65 were drawn from the Commonwealth, from the UK, Canada, Australia, New
                    Zealand, India, Nigeria and Pakistan. It is rather sad to note that the two
                    Nigerian officers there later lost their lives in the civil war in their
                    country. It was a very stimulating, exciting group of men to work with. There
                    were no ladies in the class at that time, I am sorry to say. As one of the
                    Americans, we were treated very royally, given access to every sporting and
                    social event that you could imagine in London.</p>
                <p>The daily routine was very sophisticated and very attuned to the British way of
                    doing things. You met at 9:00 for coffee and at 9:30 you had a speaker drawn
                    from the top echelons of European or British government or from the NATO
                    headquarters. You worked with him, talked with him, he spoke with you through
                    lunch. In the afternoon you broke up into what was known as syndicates, which
                    are little groups, to work on papers that were assigned to you. There was tea at
                    4:00 and sherry at 6:00. You all wandered home alone about 7:00 in time for
                    cocktails!</p>

                <p>NES: Perhaps I could begin by regaling you with how I was assigned to Saigon in
                    the first place. I was just finishing up in December the IDC course in London
                    when I got a telephone call to report back to Washington immediately. I
                    explained that the course wasn't over and that I was in the middle of preparing
                    a British defense budget, but that didn't seem to cut any ice. So I got on a
                    plane the next morning and flew back.</p>
                <p>I was called up to the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs for an appointment with
                    Roger Hilsman, the Assistant Secretary. Roger said, “What would you think about
                    going out to Saigon as Cabot Lodge's deputy?” I expressed some surprise and
                    said, “How has this come about?” He said, “Well, you may recall that when you
                    were in Libya, Cabot Lodge came over there as our UN Ambassador for a visit and
                    you offered him a choice between coming to the Embassy for all sorts of
                    activities, ceremonies, cocktail parties, etc., or taking the Ambassador's car
                    and going out to the Rome ruins at Sabratha and watching the sun set. [I
                    recommended the latter, which Ambassador Lodge accepted.] When the problem of
                    replacement of our current DCM in Saigon arose, we asked the Ambassador if he
                    had any preference. We offered him three names and he apparently selected Nes
                    because of his Libyan experience.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>NES: As you probably noticed, I arrived in Cairo in late June 1965. I found
                    through my Foreign Service experience that when a new DCM is arriving, the
                    ambassador usually arranges it to occur just before the Fourth of July so he can
                    go off on leave and turnover the Fourth of July party to the new DCM. That is,
                    in fact, what happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Before he left, our Ambassador at that time, Luke Battle, took me out into the
                    garden for a little confidential chat. He gave me quite a scary summary of the
                    deteriorating US-Egyptian relations following the recent burning of the USIS
                    library and the downing of an oil company plane in the desert by Egyptian
                    fighters. He made it very clear that Washington took the dimmest view of all
                    this and was becoming more and more anti-Nasser, but that he, himself, felt that
                    we should do everything possible to maintain reasonable and normal relations. He
                    just wanted me to have that view of his before he left for a week or so.</p>
                <p>We had quite a struggle through the next year in maintaining any sort of program
                    assistance for Egypt and I would say that was our principal mission up to the
                    months preceding the so-called June War. Our relationship, however, with
                    individual Egyptians was absolutely perfect. I had access to the people you
                    would suppose a DCM could see, not President Nasser, of course. But I had access
                    to the Foreign Minister and the various area heads in the Foreign Office at any
                    time. Also to the heads of the various departments of government, particularly
                    on the economic side. Life in Cairo was very agreeable as far as our
                    relationship with the Egyptians was concerned. My wife became a close friend of
                    Mrs. Sadat whose husband, and later President, was speaker of the Parliament.
                    They met to brush up Mrs. Sadat's English every Thursday for a year.</p>

                        part of this interview. Have you had any second thoughts since doing that
                        several months ago? Do you have anything you would like to add to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NES: Not with particular reference to the immediate weeks preceding the June War
                    which were captured in the little paper I gave you. But our relationship with
                    Egypt was very difficult because of the feeling in Washington, particularly in
                    other agencies on the government than the State Department, that Nasser should
                    be penalized for the various activities he was carrying on which we considered
                    contrary to US interests. Particularly in the Saudi Arabian Peninsula, the Port
                    of Aden and in that general area, which, as you recall, he had quite a
                    substantial land force at the southern end of the Peninsula and was actively
                    involved in the civil war between the two halves of the Yemen.</p>
                <p>We had various embarrassing set-tos with him. At one point, our AID mission chief
                    in the Yemen for some unknown reason stored a lot of very highly classified
                    cables in his office safe unlocked which Egyptian intelligence got hold of. Of
                    course they accused us privately (it never went public) with trying to damage
                    their interests in that area and, in particular, to take sides in the civil war.
                    So we had a lot of little difficulties as time went on.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>We really worked very hard to persuade Washington that it was in our long-range
                    interests not to drive Nasser into such a corner of frustration that he would
                    lash out in some unreasonable way, either against Israel or Libya, against our
                    interests in Egypt itself. I would say that to Luke Battle and myself, that was
                    our principal mission during those several years—to try to build and maintain a
                    normal relationship with a very important country in the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There has been a lot of speculation and discussion, pro

                        of Nasser's feeling and what influenced and caused his anti- American
                        actions? Were they reflexive as you have suggested or were there more basic
                        reasons? I come back always to the Palestinian issue and how that impacted
                        on his thinking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NES: Again, it does seem curious to all of us now that the Palestinian issue did
                    not play a major role in our relationship with Egypt, or in fact in Nasser's
                    thinking at the time. I think he was convinced, rightly or wrongly, that the
                    Johnson Administration was out to get him. He based this on the fact that we
                    were doing or not doing a lot of fairly minor things. We were holding up the PL
                    480 wheat program which was absolutely essential to feed his people. We had
                    vetoed a nuclear desalting project that was very close to his heart and one in
                    which we had promised him assistance initially. We had withdrawn a mission by
                    Secretary Rusk who was scheduled to come to Egypt and abruptly canceled. There
                    were just a whole litany of little things that Nasser felt were demonstrative of
                    the aim of the Johnson Administration to bring him down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we go back to Saigon. What was the status of our
                        involvement at that point in Saigon? What was the situation on the ground
                        with regard to both the French and the US and the Vietnamese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NES: By the time I arrived, we had some 25,000 so-called advisers on the ground
                    out to battalion level in the Vietnamese army for training and advisory
                    functions. The activities of the communist forces in the South, known as Viet
                    Cong, were obviously increasing day by day, both in taking over villages,
                    particularly in the Delta, but also in a tremendous propaganda effort. It was
                    very clear that the control and supply of these Viet Cong forces came directly
                    from Hanoi. We were able to intercept the radio and ground communications to a
                    certain extent. The heart and mind of the whole operation in South Vietnam
                    centered in Hanoi which meant that it was very hard to get at.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Shortly after my arrival, General Westmoreland arrived to take over command. We
                    got along very well. I traveled with him by helicopter and light plane into
                    every provincial capital in South Vietnam which gave me a pretty good bird's eye
                    view of the situation. It seemed very clear to most of us that the tentacles of
                    the communist effort in the South extended so far into the villages in the
                    countryside that it would be very difficult, if not virtually impossible, to
                    rout them out without going into the heart and brains of the operation in Hanoi,
                    which, of course, would have meant the occupation of North Vietnam as we had
                    occupied Germany and Japan and which was politically unthinkable back home in
                    the United States, or in fact in the Western world.</p>
                <p>General Westmoreland, I think, was still hopeful that the effort we were engaged
                    in in the South could prevail, but I am not sure he was that optimistic. He told
                    me at one point, if he had the number of troops that were bogged down in the
                    South and could use them for the occupation of the North, we would suffer far
                    fewer casualties than we are suffering now.</p>
                <p>During my brief tenure, we did begin to build up forces. First of all providing
                    direct air support to the Vietnamese, secondly, naval support off the coast. But
                    by the time of my departure we hadn't yet introduced any active combat units.
                    These were to come very briefly thereafter in tremendous numbers as we all know.
                    But I would say that at the end of my short time there was not too much optimism
                    that we could achieve our objective, which was very simply preserving a non-
                    communist South Vietnam. We could not achieve that objective without in effect
                    going after the North directly. My departure from Saigon was sudden and
                    unexpected. With no warning. Ambassador Lodge departed to run in the 1964
                    Presidential elections. General Taylor was appointed as Ambassador and chose
                    career Ambassador Johnson as his deputy, and so I was “trumped” out of a
                    job.</p>

                    in mind, David Bruce in Paris. He was a Renaissance man of tremendous charm,
                    tremendous intellect, tremendous abilities. He wrote a book on the first 14 or
                    15 Presidents of the United States. He knew his history. He was a connoisseur of
                    antique furniture, architecture, of good wines, a crack shot, a good golfer
                    before he injured his back during World War II. He knew Europe intimately from
                    his experience of heading up OSS operations during World War II. He was married
                    to a very charming wife, Evangeline. And he was just a very able person. I will

                    until 8:00 in the evening because of the time differences and the cable traffic
                    with Washington, he would come into the outer offices along about 3 or 4 o'clock
                    and say, “David, nothing is going on let's go out shopping.” He would take me
                    out to antique shops and teach me something about antique French furniture. When
                    his liquor salesman came in, and he would order cases of wine for the Embassy,
                    he would say, “You know, I like this particular wine, can I put an extra case in
                    for you and you can pay me later?” That was his charming social time.</p>
                <p>He was given by the French Government a lovely country house called Chateau de
                    Lanterne on the grounds of the Versailles Gardens and Palace, and he and
                    Evangeline repaired out there every weekend. Of course it was my job to bring
                    the cables out so that he could read and draft anything and bring them back.
                    Knowing that I was a very keen golfer, I played at St. Cloud and actually played
                    on the French Golf Team, he always arranged that I bring the cables out Saturday
                    morning so that I could have a quick round of golf and then come back and pick
                    them up afterwards.</p>
                <p>That was the social and sporting side of David Bruce. But on his professional
                    side he was a fantastic rapporteur. I remember one night he came back from a
                    dinner party with the Prime Minister in white tie and tails. He went up to the
                    code room and dictated directly to the operator of the code machine the most
                    concise, beautifully written cable to Washington I have ever read. He was a pro,
                    a Renaissance man. I learned so much from him. I think having been with him gave
                    me a terrific leg-up in the rest of my career.</p>

                    lucky, and as I say, I happened to be in the right spot at the right time many,
                    many times in the Foreign Service. My wife and I loved all our posts. We liked
                    the people in all the countries in which we served. I found something
                    interesting in every post, even in mundane Glasgow, Scotland where I had the job
                    of doing the economic and political reporting in the post war years when the
                    Goebbels area was going communist and light industry was trying to move in and
                    replace heavy industry. A post where most people would have found it very dull.
                    I found it very interesting.</p>

                <p>NES: I think that helped! Paris, of course, working first of all with Ambassador
                    Harriman as part of the Marshall Plan. I had a lovely office overlooking the
                    Place de la Concorde from the Palais de Talleyrand which I shared with Vernon
                    Walters. I happened to be the Assistant Political Adviser and Vernon Walters was
                    the Military Adviser. We got to know each other very well. Of course, I was
                    delighted to see him move on up and become Deputy Director of CIA and then the
                    head of our UN operation and finally, currently, our Ambassador in Germany.
                    Paris was an absolute gem in the crown.</p>
                <p>The State Department provided the most difficult times because of the bureaucracy

                    around the Department and through two or three agencies of government. I think
                    serving in the Department is a very frustrating experience and most officers are
                    delighted to get back into the field.</p>
                <p>Morocco, of course, is the most beautiful country with the most gorgeous sea

                    was fascinating. But of all the posts, I think, Morocco was the most enjoyable

                <p>CAIRO (1967) Following is an account of the Six-Day War as viewed from Cairo,
                    Egypt, by David Gulick NES, who was charg� d'affaires ad interim at the
                    time.Ambassador-designate Richard Nolte had arrived in Cairo on May 21 but was
                    unable to present his credentials owing to the crisis culminating in the
                    so-called June “Six-Day War.” David G. Nes, charg� d'affaires, continued to
                    conduct the affairs of the embassy during this period until Egypt broke
                    diplomatic relations with the United States and the embassy was closed. Nes
                    recalls the events immediately preceding the war, including unsuccessful
                    attempts by the United States to prevent a war by allaying Nasser's fears of an
                    Israeli attack. He also describes the Embassy's organization during that period
                    and how the Americans were evacuated to safehavens.</p>
                <p>NES: Tensions between the “front line” Arab states and Israel had been increasing
                    during the past year—engendered by guerilla attacks across Israel's eastern
                    border and Israeli reaction such as its raid on the Jordanian town of Samu and
                    its later destruction of six Syrian MiGs on the outskirts of Damascus. A
                    reported statement by Israeli Chief of Staff, General Rabin, on May 12 to the
                    effect that his forces would occupy Damascus and overthrow the regime set the
                    stage for the subsequent events leading up to the “June War.” Meanwhile, Arab
                    criticism of Nasser and demands that he do something intensified.The next day,
                    the fuse was lit when Soviet Ambassador Pojidaev informed the Egyptian Foreign
                    Office Under Secretary Al-Fiki that Israeli troops were moving for attack on the
                    Syrian border. On instructions from the Department, I called on al-Fiki May 16
                    and informed him our intelligence reported no unusual troop movements in Israel.
                    This was passed on to Nasser, who is reported to have considered this demarche
                    as merely the cover for an Israeli attack. By this time, relations between the
                    United States and Egypt had sunk so low that Nasser seemed to believe that we
                    were in collusion with the Israelis to destroy his regime. The origin of this
                    belief stems from the history of U.S.-Egyptian relations over several previous
                    years which is beyond the scope of this discussion. In brief, Nasser seemed to
                    be reaching a degree of frustration bordering on irrationality.From May 13, the
                    events moved quickly to crisis proportions. During the 14th and 15th, Egyptian
                    troops ostentatiously paraded through the Cairo streets en route to the Sinai.
                    In my conversation with al-Fiki on the 16th, he explained this move as purely
                    defensive and only designed to respond if Israel attacked Syria massively.
                    Ambassador-designate Nolte arrived the evening of May 21 and in remarks to the
                    press discounted any possibility of war or of a crisis situation. The next day
                    Nasser, in a speech to an officer group, announced that he was closing the
                    Straits of Aqaba to Israeli shipping. Such a move had always been considered a
                    casus belli by the Israeli government.On the 23rd, President Johnson sent Nasser
                    a personal letter expressing friendship with a plea for avoiding hostilities and
                    offering to send Vice President Humphrey over to discuss the crisis. On May 26,
                    the provocative editor of al-Ahram, Mohamed Heikal, had published an editorial
                    to the effect that war was inevitable. In the embassy, we had already begun
                    preparations to evacuate dependents and non-essential personnel, and
                    accomplished their departure easily by chartered aircraft from Cairo to Athens,
                    May 26-29. My wife and two younger daughters left on home leave orders on the
                    latter date. (We had been planning to leave July 10 in any event). On the eve of
                    their departure, Mrs. Anwar Sadat, wife of the future president, telephoned my
                    wife to express sorrow at this distressing turn of events. She had invited my
                    wife to come to her house once a week to help her with her English for the past
                    year. Needless to say, the week preceding June 5 was one of frenzied diplomatic
                    activity, and the cable traffic between the embassy and Washington kept our
                    communications and secretarial staff working 24 hours a day.While Nasser was
                    obviously endeavoring to soften his provocative moves of the previous week, the
                    embassy had no reason to believe from the cable traffic that Israel would long
                    delay a military strike so as to permit diplomacy or an international naval
                    presence in the straits to de-escalate the crisis. We began discussing the
                    possibility of a break in diplomatic relations and the further evacuation of
                    both official and non-official Americans should war come. The embassy,
                    meanwhile, was not kept fully informed of our contacts with the Israeli
                    government, but gained the impression that we had neither requested nor obtained
                    a “no first strike assurance” such as we had asked for and gotten from Egypt.
                    There was some belief that the Israelis had given us several weeks of grace to
                    “open” the straits by diplomatic or military means; that is, until June ll or
                    thereabouts.As the first days of June approached, plans initiated by the
                    Egyptian government were set in motion to send a delegation to Washington on
                    June 6 headed by their vice president Zakaria Mohieddine.In the embassy, we
                    established a sort of crisis center headed by our very able Arabic speaking
                    political counselor, Dick Parker, assisted by the CIA station chief Bill
                    Bromell, PAO [public affairs officer] Bob Bauer, the administrative counselor,
                    Martin Armstrong, and the consul general. With dependents and non-essential
                    personnel out of the way, we concentrated on our relations with the key Egyptian
                    ministries, namely foreign and interior, and on the exact location of all
                    American residents, including many distant from Cairo or in the Suez oil
                    fields.By Sunday, June 4, we seemed to have reached a day of quiet and some
                    moderate optimism. We had a “no first strike” pledge from Nasser. The Mohieddine
                    Mission was going to Washington, and 11:30 A.M. the next day had been set for
                    our ambassador designate to present his credentials. There seemed a chance,
                    albeit slim, of a peaceful outcome. During the morning I attended services at
                    the Anglican cathedral and then lunched with Ashraf Ghorbal from the foreign
                    office (later ambassador to Washington) who was organizing the Mohieddine
                    Mission; and after checking the embassy, went out for nine holes of golf with
                    dinner thereafter at the John Dormans (American Research Center) on their Nile
                    River boat. In fact, we were in the eye of the hurricane. Cairo that night was a
                    dead city, the streets deserted, building blacked out and car lights blue.On
                    Monday, June 5 the chancery began the day routinely with the 8:00 A.M. staff
                    meeting. We discussed continuing the evacuation of remaining Americans to
                    Alexandria, the Mohieddine Mission, Nolte's presentation of credentials—who
                    would accompany him and what he could appropriately say to Nasser. As the
                    meeting broke up shortly before 9:00 A.M., Radio Cairo reported Israeli air
                    attacks throughout the country. Outside we could hear explosions in the
                    direction of Cairo West airfield and some anti-aircraft fire, but no Israeli
                    planes were visible over Cairo. I immediately called Judge and Mrs. Brinton (an
                    elderly American couple retired in Cairo) who awaited an embassy car to take
                    them to the airport for an Athens flight and told them to sit tight. Shortly
                    thereafter, the Foreign Office called canceling Nolte's presentation of
                    credentials. The next day, John Dorman arranged for the Brintons to reach
                    Alexandria.Throughout the day Cairo Radio and TV reported gigantic Egyptian air
                    and land victories. The mood throughout the city was euphoric amid periodic air
                    raid sirens which just seemed to stimulate greater enthusiasm. From the BBC we
                    were getting another story. That evening I attended a small garden cocktail
                    party at the Bauers in the midst of which all hell broke loose overhead. While
                    no Israeli planes could be seen or heard, anti-aircraft fire was intense and
                    showered us with shrapnel, forcing all the guests indoors for the rest of the
                    evening. A modified diplomatic and intra-Embassy social life continued through
                    the week, but all official Egyptian contacts seemed to disappear.The following
                    morning, June 6, the early morning Cairo Radio broadcast reported that U.S. and
                    U.K. planes had participated in the air attacks of the previous day, and the
                    mood on the streets of Cairo became ugly. The big lie was obviously orchestrated
                    to explain why Israel alone never could have defeated the Egyptian air
                    force—i.e. shades of Suez. We advised all Americans except those needed in the
                    embassy crisis center and communications to stay at home. Our communications
                    were switched from commercial channels to our emergency radio links through the
                    Sixth Fleet. Later that morning, our consul general in Alexandria, David
                    Fritzlan, called on the emergency radio to report his offices were under attack;
                    and that he and the staff had retreated and were barricaded in the
                    communications center on the second floor. Within a few minutes he reported the
                    mob had set fire to the building and his radio went dead. Very shortly
                    thereafter, a similar distress call was received from our consul in Port Said,
                    whose offices were also under siege. Happily, within the hour, the British
                    consul in Alexandria called to say that Fritzlan and staff had been evacuated
                    safely and taken to the police station for safety. The situation in Port Said
                    was similarly resolved. Our buildings in both cities were virtually destroyed,
                    but no one, miraculously, was injured. In Cairo, we asked the minister of
                    interior for full protection, which was quickly forthcoming and involved a
                    paratroop company around the embassy and small military units at the embassy
                    residence and my residence on Sharia Wilcox in Az-Zamalik. Early that evening,
                    Nolte was called to the foreign office and handed a note breaking diplomatic
                    relations. I followed up with the chief of protocol requesting that we be
                    permitted to retain under a protecting power twenty-four officers and an
                    adequate support staff, the same complement permitted Britain following the Suez
                    War. This was refused, and further talks were agreed to for the next day. We had
                    strongly recommended to Washington that Spain be requested to handle our
                    interests. The Spanish ambassador in Cairo, Angel Sagaz, had exceptionally good
                    relations with the Egyptian government and was a very personable, competent
                    career diplomat. The Department reluctantly agreed because they were not
                    enthusiastic about asking the Franco government for anything and feared media
                    and political criticism.At 9:00 P.M. representatives from the interior ministry
                    called at the chancery and demanded that all Americans in Egypt be immediately
                    concentrated in the Cairo Hilton Hotel—an impossible and impractical order based
                    on out-of-date lists, which our consular staff corrected for them.Wednesday,
                    June 7, I spent much of the day in frustration shuttling between the Foreign
                    Office and Spanish embassy seeking agreement on the embassy staff we could leave
                    behind. Back at the chancery, talks were underway with embassy Athens to charter
                    a ship for evacuation from Alexandria. The Egyptian government had demanded that
                    all Americans, except the agreed number, leave by Saturday, June 10. This
                    involved about 550 all together including those already in Alexandria and Port
                    Said. Those in the Suez Gulf oil fields were being exempted. The mood in Cairo
                    was becoming increasingly threatening as reports of Egyptian defeats filtered in
                    from the BBC and other foreign stations.We had already destroyed classified
                    files and code machines. These were equipped with chemical destruction kits. The
                    Marine sergeant in charge apparently misread the directions, and considerable
                    fire ensued on the chancery roof where the machines and files had been taken.
                    This resulted in consternation among the Egyptian troops “protecting” us who
                    assumed it was a bomb, and the equivalent of five to six alarms were sent in to
                    the neighborhood fire houses. The resulting confusion and noise was awesome! The
                    fire was quickly put out without Egyptian assistance. When things calmed down,
                    we officially turned over the embassy to the Spanish ambassador, lowering the
                    stars and stripes and raising the Spanish flag. Ambassador Sagaz seemed a little
                    overwhelmed by the size and complexity of our compound, which was many times the
                    size of his establishment.Thursday, June 8, we learned from the BBC that Israeli
                    forces were approaching the Suez Canal and had taken Sharm el Sheikh. Egypt,
                    however, refused a UN sponsored cease-fire. About mid afternoon, we received an
                    “immediate” message reporting that the U.S. Navy ship Liberty was under attack,
                    presumably by the Egyptians, and planes were being launched from the Sixth Fleet
                    carrier Saratoga for a retaliatory strike against Egyptian targets. All of us
                    thought, “Well, this will certainly destroy any further Egyptian cooperation for
                    our safety.” An hour or two later, a second “immediate” arrived reporting that
                    the attackers were Israelis.The next day, June 9, we had good news. Embassy
                    Athens had succeeded in chartering a recently renovated cruise ship, the 3,000
                    ton Carina built in Glasgow in 1930. She had accommodations for 150, and we
                    would be 550 minimum. Also, the Egyptians had laid on a special train from Cairo
                    to Alexandria for 9:00 A.M. Saturday morning, the 10th. All seemed in order for
                    a non-eventful departure. The foreign office had finally agreed to our leaving
                    under Spanish protection four officers headed by Dick Parker and some dozen
                    support personnel. They specifically requested that Bill Bromell stay. Since
                    they had read the Invisible Government [a book about the CIA], this CIA contact
                    was considered as providing a direct channel to the White House if ever needed.
                    [Bromell had been “declared” to the Egyptian government]. In the course of the
                    day, I paid courtesy farewell calls on six Western ambassadors who had been
                    particularly helpful to me as charg� and on the provost at the Anglican
                    cathedral.In the early afternoon, Cairo Radio announced that President Nasser
                    would deliver an important address to the nation that evening. Parker, Bromell,
                    Bauer and I repaired to the ambassador's residence for dinner. In the 25 minutes
                    of “Mea Culpa” Nasser assumed all responsibility for the defeat and said he was
                    resigning the presidency. It was perfect theater, as within minutes the streets
                    were thronged with mobs chanting “Nasser, Nasser.” During the dinner Ambassador
                    Sagaz called to report that Parker had been declared persona non grata; and so
                    Bromell would be left as senior officer to manage the packing of several hundred
                    households and location for shipment of as many cars left on Cairo streets. What
                    a fate for a senior CIA Officer!From the chancery we could hear numerous
                    explosions throughout the city only to learn in due course they were intended as
                    a sign of support for Nasser. At 10:30 P.M., we were called by the interior
                    ministry and informed that our security could not be guaranteed in the daylight
                    on the next morning, and we would have to board our boat train at 2:00 A.M. That
                    gave us three-and-a-half hours to round up some four hundred Americans and
                    arrange to get them safely to the station. Leaving Parker in charge, I returned
                    to the Sharia Wilcox residence in an unmarked car with an embassy driver and a
                    marine, both of us carrying several hand grenades. Hopefully, this would give us
                    a chance to escape from a mob were we to be surrounded and attacked. At the
                    house, I grabbed two bags already packed, embraced in farewell our tearful cook,
                    Goma, and proceeded back to the chancery, picking up the Pan American Airline
                    representative George Angelis and his wife, Katy, en route. We encountered one
                    street blocked by demonstrators, we stopped and they passed around us without
                    incident. Back at the chancery, the crisis team had done a magnificent job in
                    contacting all known Americans, arranging for them to reach the embassy
                    compound.As there was still conflicting advice from the foreign office and
                    interior ministry as to the security situation for a 2:00 A.M. train departure,
                    I sent Bromell out to talk with the director of Intelligence at Heliopolis—also
                    to try to reverse the decision on Parker. He returned with an affirmative on the
                    first, a negative on the second, and a request that I stay as senior U.S.
                    diplomat. We replied, without reference to the Department, that I would stay if
                    we could retain the complement of officers and staff originally requested. This
                    was refused.On Saturday, June 10, between 1 and 2 A.M. we began shuttling our
                    people in six embassy cars and a NAMRU [Naval Medical Research Unit] bus to the
                    station accompanied by Egyptian military guards. I sent the Cadillac with two
                    marines around to the residence for Nolte. Finally, as the last to leave, I
                    closed the chancery door for the final time and affixed the Spanish seal.Aziz,
                    our senior embassy chauffeur, drove the Angelises and me to the station without
                    incident. There we found the train being loaded efficiently and all personnel
                    seemingly accounted for. Just before 2:00 A.M. Ambassador Sagaz appeared, having
                    driven himself through still blacked-out Cairo to say farewell—a very courageous
                    and thoughtful gesture. (He was later assigned as Spanish ambassador to
                    Washington). The train pulled out at 3:30 A.M. with shades drawn, arriving on
                    the dock in Alexandria at about 7:30 A.M. And then the greatest hassle of the
                    week ensued.All together, we had some 1500 pieces of baggage which customs
                    insisted on opening and inspecting each and every one except Nolte's and mine.
                    This took six hours until 3:00 P.M. during which time we were provided neither
                    food, water nor toilet facilities. During the day, one of our AID officers
                    became seriously ill with an internal hemorrhage. As he needed immediate
                    surgery, the Egyptian authorities permitted his transfer to a local hospital,
                    where he died shortly after arrival—the only American casualty in Egypt during
                    the war.The Carina docked at 3:00 P.M. Going on board to talk to the captain, I
                    was informed we had to sail by 5:00 P.M or wait until the next morning. This
                    involved loading those 1500 pieces of baggage now being repacked on the dock in
                    considerable confusion. Jim Hutchins, our agricultural attach�, quickly solved
                    the problem by forming a living conveyor belt, or bucket brigade, each piece
                    being passed from hand to hand in a human chain to the total astonishment of the
                    watching Egyptian authorities. By 4:45 P.M. all was aboard, and the Carina
                    sailed for Piraeus.Outside the twelve mile limit, two Sixth Fleet destroyers
                    joined to escort us on to Greece where we reached port at 2:30 P.M. on Sunday,
                    and were met by Ambassador Phil Talbot. The best quote of the voyage came from
                    89-year-old Judge Brinton, who had joined us on the dock in Alexandria. When I
                    asked whether he and Mrs. Brinton were comfortable in a cabin I had managed to
                    get for them, he replied, “Well, I haven't had such a nice sea voyage since we
                    were evacuated during the Suez War!”I think there are lessons to be learned from
                    the embassy's involvement in the June War. Some of them are:</p>
                <p>1. Never, ever should the White House send a politically-appointed ambassador
                    with no diplomatic or embassy-country team management experience to his post in
                    the middle of a developing crisis with a war near at hand.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>2. As a crisis situation develops, a small—no larger than six officer-team should
                    be established to deal with both the diplomatic and administrative requirements.
                    Ideally, they should include the DCM, political counselor, CIA station chief,
                    administration and consular heads. In our case, we included the PAO because of
                    his excellent local contacts, good judgment and approach to critical problems
                    with both equanimity and a fine sense of humor. Our senior secretary, Mary
                    Pollock, provided office support for the crisis team and did a superb,
                    officer-level job, working 12 hour days or more throughout without
                    complaint.</p>
                <p>3. It is very helpful to have a CIA station chief who is “declared” to the host
                    government so as to establish close working relations with the intelligence and
                    security people.</p>
                <p>4. Pre-crisis evacuation planning is often useless and—as a practical matter is
                    replaced by ad-hoc decisions dictated by the local situation and extent of
                    cooperation by the host government.</p>
                <p>5. Finally, because of understandable communications limitations, the embassy
                    should be prepared to make hour-by-hour decisions without reference to the
                    Department of State.</p>
