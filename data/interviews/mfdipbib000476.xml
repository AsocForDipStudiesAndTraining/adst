                <p>ELIZABETH J. HARPER</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: William D. Morgan </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: June 18, 1992</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>SUMMARY: Elizabeth J. Harper, with over forty years of association with migration
                    issues, discusses in considerable detail and frankness her many experiences,
                    impressions and opinions on this important, timely subject. Calling on her
                    innumerable first-hand associations and friendships with the principal players
                    on the Hill and in the State Department, Ms. Harper lays out relevantly the
                    historical background for American migration policy. She then discusses
                    precisely and in extensive detail the principal issues in the various U.S.
                    immigrations laws since 1952, with particular emphasis on the recent Acts of
                    1986 and 1990. Perhaps the highlight of the interview is the way she
                    pragmatically and specifically outlines the pressures, conflicting ideological
                    tendencies, and especially the real-world economic and political interests—often
                    contradictory—that make up the compromises in U.S. immigration policy, or lack
                    of it, today. An example of her most useful approach is the way she traces the
                    needs and demands of labor unions, employers, agricultural interests. and ethnic
                    groups as they have influenced immigration policies formulation from the 19th
                    century up to the present time. Specifically and as an example for the reader,
                    Ms. Harper gives a clear, rational and logical explanation for the present-day
                    labor certification requirements, and why they exist. Listing the many
                    conflicting interests, she outlines not only factually but with considerable
                    feeling what she considers to be the essence of both the technical and
                    philosophical underpinnings of American migration policy. Her prognosis for a
                    more balanced and equitable policy is both realistic and somewhat bleak.</p>
                <p>BIOGRAPHY: After U.S. military service overseas in the Women's Army Corps,
                    Elizabeth J. Harper entered the Foreign Service of the State Department in 1951.
                    She has served abroad in Indonesia, Japan and Canada and the vast amount of her
                    Washington experience has been in the Visa Office of the Bureau of Consular
                    Affairs. Ms. Harper rose from a deputy position in the Division of Legislation
                    and Regulations to the rank of Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Visa
                    Services. Upon her retirement in 1980, she continued on in the bureau, and in
                    more recent years in the Visa Office, as a consultant.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>This interview is part of the Abba Schwartz Foundation Oral History Interview
                    program which has interviewed ten, senior, former—or in some cases
                    present—leaders of the visa function. We will be talking about many more things
                    than visas, but in general that part of the topic of migration to the United
                    States will be our principal focus. Let's first ask B. J., as she is known to
                    many of her friends, to give the reader a bit of insight into her background and
                    what brought her into this, to some, difficult field of immigration and visa
                    law. I should tell the reader, because I'm sure she would not say so explicitly,
                    that there are few people in the world with B. J. Harper's knowledge of U.S.
                    immigration policy, procedures and the visa function. She has written a
                    comprehensive book and many articles on the subject, has given extensive
                    testimony in Congress, and briefed senior officials in the State Department
                    throughout her rich and extensive career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: B. J., tell us something of what brought you to the State
                        Department, to the Foreign Service, and something of the assignments you've
                        had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That's a wonderful question Bill, because the best answer to what brought
                    me to the Foreign Service is “sheer fluke”, plus an unworthy sense of
                    irritation. The fluke was that at the end of the war...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: World war II that is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: World War II, yes. I'm too old to have been in any of the more recent
                    ones. I thought about volunteering for Korea, but I it started the same day I
                    began a course preparatory for the Foreign Service exams. The FS won. Getting
                    back to the end of the war, I was in Manila, in uniform, and you know how much
                    clamor there always is to “bring the boys home” as soon as a war ends. You can
                    imagine how much greater it was to bring the girls home, so of course, they
                    wouldn't let any WACs (Women's Army Corps members) go over to Japan as
                    “Occupationnaires” in uniform.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Occupationnaires”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HARPER:However, if we had enough points to get out of the Army, we could go as
                    civilian employees of SCAP (Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers), which I
                    did. The military billeting system was such that my roommate proved to be a
                    Foreign Service secretary assigned to the Diplomatic Section of SCAP. The fluke
                    was developing a close friendship with someone in the Foreign Service through
                    the happenstance of Army billeting. I had never previously given it a thought.
                    In fact, if I could have gone to Japan in the military, I might have made the
                    Army my career. Naturally, we were a small community at the beginning of the
                    Occupation, and so everybody knew everybody and I went to her organization's
                    parties, just as she went to mine. The “unworthy incentive”, if you will,
                    derived from the arrival, about a year or so later, of several new, young and
                    distinctly brash Foreign Service officers at the Diplomatic Section whom I would
                    run into at various parties. They constantly explained to everyone that the
                    Foreign Service exam was the hardest exam that had ever been created, and only
                    they could possibly have passed it. And I got more and more irritated, thinking
                    to myself, “by George, if they could, I could.” (laugh) So, in 1949, I resigned
                    my job in Tokyo, came home, went to school and took the Foreign Service exams.
                    (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of very few women in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, there were some, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Five percent, maybe at most?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I really don't know; possibly 5% at most. You know, the (I hope
                    apocryphal) story at that time was that the Boards [of Examiners] accepted one
                    woman or one black in alternate years. Anyway, there were no other women and no
                    blacks in my class. (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You picked a good year, B. J..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: So that was the origin of my interest in the Foreign Service. My becoming
                    a...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You obviously passed the exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I passed the exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was a three day exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: It was a three and a half day exam at that time. And...</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And orals to follow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: And orals to follow. And, you know, (laughs) it really was a difficult
                    exam; I'll give the guys credit for that. It was a difficult exam. Not unlike,
                    in some respects, the “Comprehensives” for a Master's degree. Anyway, getting
                    into consular work was also somewhat of a fluke because I had, among other
                    things, been a newspaper reporter, earlier as a civilian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went into the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, and I had done various kinds of public affairs things in the Army,
                    such as my own radio show, when I was down in Ft. Bliss, 15 minutes a week,
                    which I wrote, directed, announced and whatever. So when the Chairman of the
                    Board was about to usher me out of the Hearing room, he said, “Now you
                    understand, Ms. Harper, that with your background”, Oh! I almost forgot to add
                    that I had been in the Information Section of SCAP for three and a half years.
                    Anyway, Mr. Greene said, (this is Joe Green, Sr. I don't know if you go back far
                    enough in the Service...)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: But you remember the name. I don't recall whether he was a Career
                    Ambassador or Director General, but he was famous in the Service at that time.
                    Well, he said “you understand that if you are appointed your career will be a
                    little different from usual because you'll probably spend most of your time
                    doing information type assignments,” or words to that effect. So I said that
                    would be fine. Of course at that point, USIA was not a separate Agency; public
                    affairs were in State. Well, it didn't work out that way. My first assignment
                    was as an administrative officer down in Medan, Sumatra, who also did what
                    little consular work there might be. The consulate in Medan was not authorized
                    to issue immigrant visas and there wasn't much demand for non- immigrant visas
                    there at the time. Mostly it was citizenship-related; those were the days when
                    we required American citizens to register with the consulate when they visited
                    or resided abroad. It wasn't a suggestion as it is now. It was a requirement.
                    Then when I went to Japan on my next assignment, I was put in the consular
                    section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your very first assignment was overseas? After the
                        training, after your basic course.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>HARPER: Yeah, after the basic course, I went to Indonesia. I had asked for Japan,
                    of course; I had loved Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If the Service knew that, they wouldn't have sent you
                        there, though.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well we were signing a peace treaty there at that moment, and the
                    Department didn't want to send ex-Occupationnaires back immediately. So I had
                    requested anywhere in Southeast Asia except Manila. They sent me to the
                    South-Eastest Asia post that we have. If you traveled east to get there, or if
                    you traveled west to get there, it was within ten miles of being
                    equidistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were half way around the world, from Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: You were, absolutely! From Washington. Medan, Sumatra. It was a little
                    bitty post, and so I was sort of everything, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And today in Indonesia. Is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: It was Indonesia then.</p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, it was Indonesia then and we (the United States) were very popular,
                    because the United States cast the deciding vote on whether or not they would
                    gain their independence. In fact, the first sentence in the Bahasa Malaya
                    language course was,” Saya tidak orang belandja. Saya orang Amerika.” Which
                    means, “I am not Dutch, I am American!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like me!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That is no longer the first sentence in the Bahasa Malaya course, but it
                    was, I can assure you, in 1952. (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your first assignment was '52?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: It was '52, and ahhh....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went through language first, some of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>HARPER: Well, no, you learned it or you didn't, as the case may be, on the spot,
                    on the job. Of course in those days you had to have passed a foreign language
                    exam to be appointed. However, I did learn a fair amount of Bahasa in my two
                    years, and translated a series of news articles as political reports. However, I
                    continued to ask for Japan, and sure enough got Tokyo as my second post, where I
                    was put in the consular section, in passports. So I first became really more of
                    a passport specialist for some years than anything doing with visas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lots of American military that needed passports?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Lots of American military there, who were getting married, and having
                    children, or even if they brought their wives out from home, a wife who already
                    had children, others still got born, and so they needed passport and citizenship

                <p>HARPER: I thought so. But I did also have an interest in visas. I had written a

                <p>HARPER: No. I was here because I was going to take the FS exams, and I decided
                    this was where to get the best education in order to take these exams.</p>

                <p>HARPER: My place of origin is the great Middle West. I was born in Oklahoma,
                    lived in Texas, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Nebraska, and Colorado, which was
                    just a little far west for the great Middle West, but nonetheless, ... I claim

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, in time. Anyway, I had written one of my graduate papers on visas,
                    to the effect that the 1924 Immigration Act was a contributing factor to Pearl
                    Harbor. You know, irritation of the Japanese, sensitivity of the Japanese, kind
                    of thing. I spent an entire Christmas vacation more or less living in the
                    Library of Congress going through the 1924 papers, which, incidentally, was
                    fascinating. When you looked at the front pages from 1924, and 1952, they all
                    looked alike. They were both election years, they were both years in which we
                    were having political scandals, they were both years in which the Congress was
                    investigating everything under the sun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And everybody was investigating Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: And everybody was investigating Congress. It was just a fascinating
                    parallel in history. In any event, I did have this sort of latent interest in
                    immigration, so when I started issuing visas, in a subsequent post, it struck me
                    as interesting too, and....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not in Tokyo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: No, no, in Tokyo I was strictly in citizenship. But I've been very lucky.
                    I've always served with people from whom I've learned a lot. That helps, you
                    know, and my colleagues there taught me an awful lot about the Foreign Service.
                    Then I went to language school. I was the first woman Japanese Language
                    Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have a Japanese language program then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: We did, indeed, and we had a school in Tokyo; so I spent a year and a
                    half there. After that, I was transferred to Okinawa, which was before it had
                    receded back to Japanese control. We were still controlling Okinawa at that
                    point. And,...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did we have? We had bases there, but we also had a
                        large American community?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, in the military and civilian employees sense. Not many others. We
                    were literally running the government of Okinawa, at that point, the Ryukyu
                    Islands. Having managed to get back to Japan, I managed to stay. Between the
                    time when I went into that Tokyo assignment and the time I came home, I'd been
                    there roughly eleven years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was 1952?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I left Medan in 1954.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1954, when you got to Tokyo, and then eleven years
                        later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, I came home the first of July, 1965. It was ten years, really, ten
                    years plus. Because I didn't actually get to Tokyo until about January or
                    February of '55.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then after four years, you went to Okinawa, then back
                        to Tokyo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I went to Kobe Osaka. It was Kobe-Osaka in those days. It's Osaka-Kobe
                    today. (laughs) My assignment was as Chief of the consular section, and ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big of a post was it? It was a consulate general, I
                        presume?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: It was a consulate general. We had, in addition to the Consul General, we
                    had one economic officer, about four consular officers, admin officer—except the
                    admin officer (laugh) God love him, really diverted my activities. First of all,
                    he persuaded the Department to let him buy a house, an old house, at an
                    excessive price, for a principal residence (that is, for the Consul General),
                    assuring the Department that it needed no initial repairs, thus justifying
                    spending all this money for it. Actually it needed about $25,000 worth of
                    repairs. Then two days after all of the papers were signed, he transferred to
                    Tokyo and I became Acting Administrative Officer and responsible for all those
                    repairs in order to make the place habitable! Anyway, that's a different story,
                    and unrelated to immigration, but it did take a lot of time away from my
                    consular duties. Q: But as Chief of the Consular Section, you had not only
                    visas, but you had the whole schmear.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>HARPER: I had the whole schmear. Yes, in addition to visas, you know, we had
                    Americans in jail, we had people who were losing citizenship, or who were
                    regaining it, and lots of seamen. You will recall, Bill, in the early '60s,
                    which is when I was in Kobe, during the whole period of the late '50s, early
                    '60s, the Supreme Court was frequently invalidating one loss of nationality
                    provision or another. So people who had been technically expatriated, all of a
                    sudden had not been expatriated, because the related provision of law was found
                    not to be constitutional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were being challenged. This very, very strict biased,
                        if I may use the word, citizenship approach, including on women, was
                        repeatedly challenged, and it kept falling. So today, I think we might say,
                        B. J., it's pretty hard if not impossible to lose your American
                        nationality.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I think, actually, it is. And in many ways, I regret it. However, that's
                    beside the point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In any event, you had the product of these changes when
                        you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yeah. Don't misunderstand me, I don't mind making it more difficult to
                    lose American nationality. I do mind, speaking personally, making it unduly too
                    easy to gain American nationality. I think it demeans the importance of ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Green card and five years' wait.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, it isn't so much the green card and five years' wait. I think
                    immigrants should have a reasonable chance to naturalize if they want to; our
                    original ancestors here—mine came before the Revolution—were not native-born
                    U.S. citizens. What bothers me is the law regarding, for instance, the
                    transmission of citizenship. John Doe, American citizen, or Mary Doe, American
                    citizen, goes overseas, marries some alien, makes his or her home in that
                    foreign country forever, has a child. We have watered down the length of time
                    the American citizen parent must have been resident in the United States in
                    order to transmit citizenship. We have watered down the length of time, if any,
                    I think we may in fact have eliminated, the length of time the child, who
                    becomes a citizen at birth, has to come and spend in the United States, in order
                    to retain citizenship. I think that's unfortunate, because we end up with a
                    number of American citizens, in name only, who then become the responsibility of
                    American consuls to protect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a different question. But the first question is, of
                        course, what makes an American? Attitude, loyalty, all these words that you
                        and I would say make an American. Some people argue, however, that those
                        issues aren't necessarily what makes an American.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>HARPER: Well, I continue to believe no matter what nationality it is, I don't
                    care whether it's American, British, Indian or whatever, it should have an
                    element of allegiance involved. (laughs) And I really feel that these people do
                    not, in many instances, have anything other than the sense of, “gee, it's handy
                    to be an American citizen, because that way I can go there if I really want to
                    sometime,” and no sense of emotional attachment to this country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, of course, you and I as consular officers, or former
                        ones, never would let that enter into our judgement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Ms. Harper: Well, it doesn't enter into my judgment if the person meets the
                    requirements of the law. What I'm arguing about, against, actually, are the
                    current requirements of the law. And I really do think that they demean the
                    importance of one's citizenship, whatever the citizenship may be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Versus whether they appear in front of you and the
                        consular establishment as an American citizen, burning the American flag and
                        swearing how much they hate America. Even that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Even that. Even that. I usually made people wait 24 hours and come back
                    before I would take an oath of renunciation, incidentally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I think that's, as I remember, part of the law, or
                        part of the procedure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, no it wasn't part of the law. But we did, I think, finally make it
                    part of the procedures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, it was indeed. I remember sending...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Before it was a procedure, a standard procedure, I did it. It was one of
                    the things I learned from the more experienced officers in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you're probably the source of some of our subsequent
                        standard procedures! (Laughs) Or laws!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: (Laughs) I'm the source of a number of standard procedures, because of my

                        And obviously when you were in Kobe-Osaka it was not what it is today,
                        especially in terms of visa restrictions, inability to travel, and the like.
                        But what were the visa issues there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Primarily the bona fides for non-immigrants, because, of course, with the

                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: There was always a question as to whether or not somebody was a bona fide
                    non-immigrant. And a great many were.</p>
                <p>Q; What was the main reason for...</p>
                <p>HARPER: The problems, however, were essentially not exclusively with the Japanese
                    who would come in and try to con us into believing that they were just making a
                    short trip and would obviously come back after seeing the Grand Canyon, or
                    whatever. You know...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The famous Niagara Falls or Grand Canyon. Or a

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yeah, and surely, or a funeral. Another real problem was with Americans,
                    who were dishonest enough to try to help them fraudulently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would they help them? What was their connection.
                        Friends?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I don't know. I mean, I remember a couple of missionaries, one roman
                    catholic and one a protestant, both of whom submitted fraudulent documents on
                    behalf of, and otherwise advised Japanese applicants. Suggestions on what kinds
                    of arguments would persuade the consul to give him, in both cases it was a him,
                    a visa</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: God's law being more important and overriding than of any
                        national law.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>HARPER: I guess so. They were also a problem when it came to children, I might
                    add. Missionaries, more than once, would come in with a child who quite clearly
                    was not their child, and try to register the baby as an American citizen, as
                    their own offspring. But, in any event, I don't want to pick on the
                    missionaries, because most of them were absolutely wonderful, but there were
                    some, who, as you say, I guess they believed that God's law was more important.
                    Although, none of them ever expressed it that way to me. Whatever their motives,
                    there were occasionally problems. I also had the interesting experience, one
                    time, of ruling off limits our consular office, and more accurately, the
                    consular section, to any member of the Japan Travel Bureau, which is a
                    Government agency. (laughs) The reason was that one of their personnel was
                    forging documents for people who were using JTB as a travel agent, and applying
                    for visas. Well, as far as I was concerned, that made not only that individual
                    ineligible under 212(a)31, as it was in those days, but it also made JTB a
                    hazard. So I informed the embassy, and I informed the Japan Travel Bureau that I
                    was sorry but no representative of their organization was going to be admitted
                    to the consulate general in Kobe-Osaka, for a minimum of 90 days. At that time
                    they could perhaps persuade me that they had sufficiently trained their people
                    that this wouldn't happen again. Q: I don't think consular officers could quite
                    do that these days!</p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, I don't know if they could either, but I certainly did it, and I
                    expected howls from the Embassy because of the Japanese government connection,
                    but I didn't get any. They said more power to you! And, meanwhile, this young
                    man was transferred to something like baggage handler in Shikoku. (laughs)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have introduced fraud as obviously a key, an emotional
                        issue for all of us associated with visas. But I never thought of fraud with
                        the Japanese, and certainly not in those times. You've opened up the subject
                        of purposeful misrepresentation. Were the applicants largely people who were
                        leaving for economic reasons? What was the basis, if there was one
                        particular one for fraud, or misrepresentation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Oh, they were, ummm....well, for instance, a kid who said he wanted to go
                    to school in the U.S., or a businessman, who really wanted simply to get lost in
                    the U.S. and work. Sometimes it was sad, because the applicants would have been
                    found eligible for a visa if they had not engaged in misrepresentation. But they
                    figured they had to do something special to get a visa—instead of playing it
                    straight. We issued more than 5,000 non-immigrant visas the year I arrived—which
                    was so unusual that the Consul General made a ceremony of personally handing the
                    applicant his visaed passport in his office—so obviously some people were bona
                    fide.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: No, they don't reject their culture, and they shouldn't. But they do, you
                    know, harbor a desire to go the United States.</p>

                <p>HARPER: And the quota got in the way. They had relatives in the U.S., there was

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: It was mostly a matter of there not being visa numbers available—even for
                    people who would be fine immigrants. In the JTB case, our office suddenly found
                    itself getting roughly identical letters, business invitations, purportedly from
                    the United States for, say, Hiroshi Watanabe, or whatever the name would be.
                    They would have misspellings, they would be written in what was usually known as
                    Japlish, you know, Japanese English, and ummm...and the fraud was perfectly
                    apparent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today we have so-called sophisticated counter-fraud,
                        anti-fraud measures. Extensive! Probably in those days we had no organized
                        way, as a State Department, and certainly as an institution, to fight
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: We certainly didn't have any institutional procedural setups, but clearly
                    everybody was supposed to be using his head, and if the same travel agent is
                    handing in lots and lots of passports, with lots and lots of documentation, all
                    of which looks as weird as a three dollar bill, your suspicions are going to

                    this by mentioning that this is being done for the Abba Schwartz Foundation, and
                    I have a very clear recollection of having breakfast with Abba one morning.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yeah, he was the Administrator at the time, and he was in Japan for a
                    country-wide Consular Conference, and I was attending from Kobe. The conference
                    was in Tokyo. I was due for transfer, in fact, I was overdue for transfer
                    actually.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is give or take mid-'60s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: This was '65. This was early 1965, probably January, February, March,
                    somewhere in that neighborhood. I had told Abba I wanted to see him at some
                    point outside the sessions, and he said, “Fine, why don't we have breakfast
                    tomorrow morning,” fine...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know him before at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Not really. I had met him on one of my home leave trips, but outside of
                    that I didn't really know him. So we had breakfast, and I explained to him that
                    I knew I was due for transfer, or overdue for transfer, and although I didn't
                    want to hurt his feelings, or suggest that I didn't enjoy my work, I wanted to
                    make a plea that I not be assigned to the Consular Bureau. I needed, I felt, an
                    excursion tour in some other part of the foreign affairs business. The Service
                    tends to peg people, as you know, and so I felt very strongly that if I could
                    get an outside assignment, maybe on the desk, you know, the Japan desk...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Sure, somewhere, almost any old where. Meanwhile, USIA and any notions of
                    being an Information officer, you know, had long since disappeared, contrary to
                    Joe Greene's assessment. In any event, Abba seemed very sympathetic to this. And
                    he went back to Washington at the end of the conference, and about three weeks
                    later, what did I get but travel orders ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To the Consular Bureau?</hi>

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>HARPER: First of July, head to the Consular Bureau. Yeah, exactly. I was not
                    really happy about the whole thing. I was assigned to VO (the Visa Office). And
                    so when I arrived in Washington, the first thing I did was present myself to
                    (laugh) Abba and say, “Thanks a bunch!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you assigned in the Visa Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Regulations and Legislation. I said, “what am I doing in the Visa Office,
                    after our lengthy discussion about broadening assignments?” and he said, “Well,
                    the Director of the Visa Office said that of all the Officers who are available,
                    you have the finest reputation for being able to write well.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Director of the Visa Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Ray Ylitalo. “And he needs somebody who can write well.” So I went into
                    Reg's and Leg's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the acronym or the brief phrase for Regulations and
                        Legislation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, which was headed at the time by a wonderful woman named Hallie Mae
                    Pryor, who unfortunately died a few years later. Again, you know, I learned an
                    enormous amount from Hallie. The important thing at the time was that the '65
                    Act was just about to be enacted. So the next time that I saw Abba was the day
                    that my household effects were due to arrive—from Japan, from Missouri, and from
                    Kansas, because my father and my Aunt were going to join me in Washington—and so
                    I had household effects arriving from everywhere over the weekend. I shall never
                    forget it, because, on late Friday afternoon, Abba got a call from, I suppose,
                    the Chairman of the Committee, I don't know, saying, you know...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chairman of what committee on the Hill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the House. I assumed that it
                    really was the Chairman and not a staffer who called Abba. And what he said was,
                    “By Monday morning, we would like to know, if we pass this Act, what effects
                    will it have on immigration from all over the world? That is to say, how many
                    visas is it likely that each of the countries would get under this legislation,
                    if enacted?” Whereupon Abba called the Visa Office, and instructed Frank Baker,
                    who was our numbers cruncher, and his boss, Helen Mulhearn, and suggested that
                    they enlist or draft somebody else to come over and spend the weekend in his
                    office with lots of adding machines, and figure out exactly what would happen if
                    the bill that became the '65 Act were passed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because in those days, there was minimal amount of
                        computer assistance, if any.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: There was none.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Ledgers, and yes, they were green, I think, as a matter for fact. And
                    adding machines, you know, big adding machines. I mean, we didn't have these
                    little pocket calculator type things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And those studies, probably generic studies, about

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, not generic especially. We had very good statistics. We knew what
                    the backed-up demands were. It seemed reasonable that if these people were
                    suddenly in a position to get 20,000 visas a year, instead of 5,000 or if they
                    were in a position to get 20,000 instead of 105, and our books showed a backlog
                    of 80-100,000 or more, for a number of countries, obviously lots more...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Demand and supply?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Lots more of them would come. So you're right, it was a supply and demand
                    equation, for every country in the world in 1965. There were fewer countries
                    then, fortunately for us. I should maybe explain my “backlogs” comment. Although
                    some countries like Great Britain, Germany, and Ireland, for instance, had
                    reasonably large quotas, most did not. The number of people who wanted to
                    immigrate was much greater than the quota and therefore the law authorized the
                    Department (the Secretary, actually) to “maintain lists” and “make reasonable
                    estimates.” So whenever anyone registered to immigrate, he or she went on the
                    waiting list until such time as a visa number might be available. I don't recall
                    the exact numbers of those days but there were well over a million people,
                    probably some multiple of a million, on the waiting lists when the '65 Act came
                    along. When asked about specific places, our answers were on the lines of, “It
                    will take until 2073 to issue visas to all the Chinese—or until 2035 for all the
                    Italians—now on the lists”, even though it was obvious that the people on the
                    list wouldn't live that long. Those answers were based, of course, on the quotas
                    then in effect. Those are the records we used.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And all these calculations and conclusions were over that
                        weekend? Instead of unloading your furniture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Over that weekend. Well, by the grace of heaven, I had a very dear friend
                    with whom I had stayed while apartment hunting, who was conscripted to go
                    (laughs)...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just like you were conscripted! Let me ask an unacceptable
                        question, B. J.. With the law out there being written, being thought
                        about—and for a period of time, I certainly presume—why hadn't we
                        anticipated this question?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I don't know that we hadn't anticipated the question. I think probably we
                    had answered the question, in very broad general terms, you know the kind of
                    sweeping generalizations that people use when they testify. But the Chairman
                    wanted a country-by-country breakdown, as to who would use how many visas, if
                    they changed the law to abolish the quotas, and let any country use up to 20,000
                    visa numbers. So, that's how we spent that weekend. And that was the next time I
                    saw Abba; and it was one of the last times, as a matter of fact that I saw Abba,
                    because VO was in a different building. But, in any event, the interesting thing
                    is, of course, this exercise did not include the Western Hemisphere. It was only
                    Asia, Europe, Africa—everywhere but the Americas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it included them in the sense of it kept them in
                        this unfavorable or how should, you would be able to characterize it better
                        than I, position that they had been in, which was not equal to...yes...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, the Western Hemisphere at that time was in a wonderful position,
                    because we didn't have any numerical limits on Western Hemisphere immigration—at
                    least, not for independent countries in the hemisphere. And, for the time being,
                    they were going to stay that way. So, we did the Eastern Hemisphere, which is
                    everything except North and South America. And our estimates were right, within
                    a few hundred, for every country but one. That exception was Ireland, which is
                    why we have been having very peculiar legislation in recent years, relative to

                <p>HARPER: The Irish question, yes. I will be glad to get into the Irish question.
                    But, in any event, we really did come very, very close. It was an interesting
                    exercise, and taught me a great deal about not only supply and demand but the
                    nuts and bolts of implementation of the law as distinct from legal questions of
                    eligibility and consular procedures.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Reg's and Leg's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I was there for a couple of years, not quite three, I think. When the
                    chief of the Field Operations division, as it was called in those days, retired,
                    I filled her job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which basically was watching out over the posts in the
                        field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Looking out for the posts in the field, developing procedures, and so on.
                    Now, of course, you understand that with the '65 Act, we created a whole new
                    arrangement for how to obtain, more accurately, how to apply for, an immigrant
                    visa. All of the ground rules were different, because of the change in the law
                    with regard to the labor certification. It was the labor certification that took
                    us off-base in our calculations about Ireland, of course. But, in any event, I
                    had participated in developing the procedures, I had participated in developing
                    the regulations, and most of all I had created a series of airgrams that went
                    out after the Act actually did pass, trying to explain it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was when? What's the date, roughly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I don't recall the date when the Congress passed it, but it was signed on
                    October 3, so that's the effective date of the legislation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1965?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: October 3, 1965, and it was to go into effect on December 1, 1965, which
                    did not leave an awful lot of room between point A and point B...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically, what we're talking about is having people
                        eligible who weren't eligible before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Q; That's right, and having a lot of people ineligible who had previously been
                    eligible. In any event, I had developed this series of airgrams, explaining to
                    the field—you remember Ray Ylitalo wanted me because I supposedly could write
                    well...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The presumption was that they read it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: The presumption was that they could read.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Q; And carry out the instructions.</p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, that was at least a fond hope! So, I wrote all these airgrams
                    explaining the new provisions and so on, and the sixth one was known familiarly
                    as,”use your head!” It explained, in general, that, since there were people who
                    would be severely disadvantaged by the new labor certification requirement but
                    who at the moment didn't need one, consular offices should take that into
                    account when doing their scheduling and, if necessary, postpone appointments for
                    people who would not be adversely affected, in order to accommodate the people
                    who would be, unless there were some extreme urgency...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's pause just a moment though, on labor certification.
                        You and I know well what it means, but just a short definition.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, let me get back to that later, Okay? Finish this thought. So number
                    six said in essence, “use your heads.” Something like eight days later, Ray
                    Ylitalo called me into the office, bright and early, banging his fist furiously,
                    and waving a sheaf of cables at me, and shouted, “ B.J., damn it, tell them to
                    stop using their heads!” (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Because the heads are different from post to post!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: We had gotten back some of the silliest inquiries and other responses
                    anybody had ever seen. Number seven and eight had already gone out, but number
                    nine of the airgrams was the “don't use your heads”...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Go back to the first five?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: They were basically explanations of the new provisions. You know, I hate
                    to divert this discussion, but it occurs to me that my labor certification
                    references may require explanation for those who haven't been at this as long as
                    I. It's important to remember that one of the central themes in immigration
                    history, and immigration policy, has been protection of the U.S. labor market,
                    starting from roughly the early 1880s; I think the first contract labor law was
                    in 1884. The contract labor law precluded the entry of anyone who had
                    prearranged employment, that is, a labor contract. It was repealed by the
                    Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. In the '52 Act, the Secretary of Labor
                    was required to issue determinations, as it were, on what areas had a oversupply
                    of what kinds of labor available. For example, if an applicant wanted to come
                    be, let's say, a dressmaker in Los Angeles, she was out of luck, because there
                    was a surplus of dressmakers in Los Angeles. On the other hand...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would be turned down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Would be turned down. That was a ground of ineligibility.</p>
                <p>Q; Even though everything else was fine?</p>
                <p>HARPER: Everything else could be splendid. But, if you wanted to seek a job in an
                    area in which there was a large supply of similar workers, sorry, but the labor
                    requirement had not been met. On the other hand, if that applicant decided that,
                    well, as a matter of fact, she had a cousin in Chicago she could stay with, and
                    could undoubtedly find a job as a dressmaker in Chicago where there was not an
                    oversupply so she wanted to go there, then she became eligible for a visa.
                    Well...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was 1952?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That was section 212(a)(14) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as
                    enacted in 1952. It replaced and repealed the contract labor laws that had been
                    in effect since the 1880s. In 1965, Congress reversed the structure of the labor
                    certification requirement. Instead of people being eligible unless they wanted
                    to go someplace where there was an oversupply of such labor, they now had to get
                    an affirmative certification from the Department of Labor that their employment
                    would not adversely affect the employment of U.S. residents, citizens or alien,
                    in the same area, same line of work, and so on. So that in order to register,
                    let alone apply for a visa, if you were coming to work rather than coming as a
                    relative of a U.S. citizen or resident alien, the first step was to get a labor
                    certification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't that a big difference in approach?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>HARPER: This was an enormous substantive change in procedures. Under prior law,
                    the question of eligibility with regard to the labor requirement was handled
                    like the question of eligibility under criminal or any other ground of
                    excludability. That is, it didn't arise until the end of the process when the
                    applicant would appear for his or her interview for issuance of a visa. At that
                    point, in connection with public charge among other things, the applicant would
                    be asked where and at what he or she intended to work. That's how the situation
                    I described a moment ago would come up. Because all grounds of ineligibility
                    were considered at the end of the line, so to speak, there was no preliminary
                    qualification for registering with a consular office as an intending immigrant.
                    People would simply write or go into a consulate or embassy and say “my name is
                    such-and-such, address is so-and-so, and I want to emigrate to the United
                    States”, and that would get their names entered on our records. The requirement
                    of the 1965 Act was that there be an affirmative certification in advance,
                    saying, in effect, that the Labor Department agreed that this employer, who
                    wants to hire this named alien, has not been able to find a suitable employee in
                    the U.S. and will pay sufficient wages not to impact adversely on U.S. workers
                    similarly employed. Now, obviously, lots of people, perhaps the majority of
                    non-relative applicants, would be unable to obtain such certifications. That
                    being so, there was no point—in fact, it would be idiotic—from the standpoint of
                    both the applicant and the consular office, to register vast numbers of people,
                    unrealistically get their hopes up, go through all the procedures and then find
                    them ineligible at the final step. In other words, that inversion of the
                    requirement created a presumption of ineligibility for all would-be immigrants
                    subject to the labor certification provision. As a result, we had to make the
                    receipt of a labor certification a requirement for registering—the first step,
                    rather than the last—for intending immigrants who were not classifiable as
                    relatives of U.S. citizens or resident aliens or in some special status.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One small question, here. From what I'm hearing in that
                        clear and detailed explanation of labor certification, that requirement
                        didn't affect all immigrants. That is, if you weren't going to enter the
                        labor market, you didn't have to meet this test. Is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes and no. Under the law it specifically did not apply to people who
                    were coming in what are called the relative preference classes and didn't apply
                    to Immediate Relatives whether or not they would go to work. It applied only to
                    people coming in the worker preferences, the non-preference classification, and
                    natives of the Western Hemisphere. By regulation, however, the State Department
                    and the Immigration Service agreed that if a non-preference or Western
                    Hemisphere immigrant was coming here as a retiree, or for some other non-working
                    purpose, we couldn't very rationally apply the labor certification requirement.
                    So we waived it by regulation, but the law required one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The non-preference person would have to prove that he did
                        not need a job. Was not going to become a public charge.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, he needed to prove two things: he didn't intend to work and had
                    ample resources without working—that is, he wouldn't become a public charge, he
                    had sufficient funds, etc., so that he wouldn't be driven into taking
                    employment; and he had no desire to take any employment, because he was 102
                    years old, maybe physically incapacitated, and unlikely to find employment, or
                    whatever. But aside from our regulatory change in the applicability of the labor
                    certification provision, there was also an interesting statutory quirk. What the
                    1965 statue said was that the Western Hemisphere applicability did not include
                    those who were the parent, spouse or child of lawful permanent residents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sounds like the “Immediate Relative” class but
                        applied to alien residents</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Indeed, at a casual glance this did appear just to take cognizance of the
                    fact that the preference system did not apply to the Western Hemisphere and I'm
                    sure it was intended to try to equate with the Eastern Hemisphere exemption for
                    Immediate Relatives. Can't you just hear them in debate saying, “Well, hey, we
                    don't apply this to Immediate Relatives of in U.S. citizens in the Eastern
                    Hemisphere: Shouldn't it be the same here?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds reasonable</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Sure. Actually, however, it went well beyond the Eastern Hemisphere
                    “Immediate Relatives”—parents, spouses, and children of U.S. citizens—because a
                    parent is not an Immediate Relative unless the petitioner offspring is at least
                    21 years of age. The Western Hemisphere “parents” provision did not contain that
                    distinction. As a result, the Western Hemisphere parents of infant U.S. citizens
                    were exempt from the labor certification requirement but the Eastern Hemisphere
                    parents of a U.S. minor child were not. Putting aside the question of fairness,
                    the real problem that this caused was a burgeoning of births in the U.S. by
                    border-crossers—a sort of legal fraud, as it were. It's a classic example of how
                    a seemingly perfectly reasonable idea, equalizing treatment in the two
                    hemispheres, can wind up having unintended consequences. All because Members
                    usually (if not always) think about broad “policy” issues, not the details of
                    how things work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that didn't last forever?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: No, that exception was dropped—that is, it was no longer necessary and
                    was therefore repealed, when the preference system was made applicable to
                    Western Hemisphere applicants under the 1976 amendments. Anyway, to get back to
                    the subject—the change in the labor certification requirement in 1965—as a
                    result of that Western Hemisphere quirk, the provision was weakened at the same
                    time it was being strengthened.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This change in the labor certification—the strengthening,
                        if you will, of the identification of whether a person you let come or not
                        come into a certain area to do a certain job—is that a result in large part
                        of labor unions bringing pressure to bear? Or what caused this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I think probably organized labor, but organized labor wasn't a factor
                    when this started. As I suggested a minute ago, protection of U.S. labor has
                    been one of the benchmarks since the 1880s. On the other hand, it could have
                    been just a spin-off of an idea that arose in the public charge context.
                    Starting in the early 1960s, maybe 1961, there was a “pilot program”, so to
                    speak, related to public charge problems, that required Mexican applicants who
                    submitted job offers in support of public charge eligibility to have those job
                    offers endorsed or some such thing by the local, maybe it was State, Employment
                    Service. I don't remember the particulars very well because I was in Japan at
                    the time, but it seemed to be an effort to confirm that the job offer was
                    genuine and the job itself was permanent, not temporary, in nature. It applied
                    only to Mexicans applying in Mexico, however, so it was not part of the pattern
                    I've mentioned. I really do think that current policies can be fully understood
                    only if the long-term patterns are kept in mind—even if current policy is at
                    odds with the pattern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You described the pattern of protection of labor. What are
                        some of the others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, there are several patterns, with respect to which the particulars
                    may have differed over the last hundred-and-some years, but the thread, the
                    concept, the underlying intent, has been roughly the same all the way along.
                    Another one is the protection of the U.S. purse. You know, even before we had
                    the contract labor laws, we had legislation that barred the entry of paupers and
                    beggars. People who would otherwise fall into the public welfare area. We still
                    have such laws.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Public charge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Public charge, we call it nowadays, but, you know, it's the same
                    provision, it's the same concept. Public health is another. We have always had
                    provisions barring people who were likely to be a threat to the public health in
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is how a sponsor, sometimes, is misused. Many people
                        think you must have a sponsor to come here. A relative, or not, it's the
                        idea that someone will step in and pay the bills, if you become
                        unemployed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>HARPER: Well, sponsorship, financial sponsorship does come in obviously.
                    Particularly in family cases. You know, it's fine for somebody to be entitled to
                    status as a sibling of a United States citizen who has petitioned for him. But
                    if he hasn't got a job, and doesn't have an awful lot of money in his pocket
                    that he's accumulated where ever he is...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The assumption is that where ever he is, he will go to
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: The assumption is that if he is of working age, he is going to go to
                    work, and moreover that he is going to have to go to work, but that may take
                    some time to achieve. So family members do provide affidavits of support. But as
                    I say, these threads have been in our immigration policy for well over a
                    century, and I think the pressures that cause more recent immigration policy to
                    be developed or to be extended, are widely, not so much misunderstood, in the
                    general public as simply un-understood, not understood. If you talk to people
                    who are not in our business, you sometimes get the feeling they think
                    immigration legislation springs from the mind of some Congressman with no
                    midwifery or anything, rather like Athena, from Zeus. The fact is there have
                    always been pressures, and the unions, with regard to protecting American labor,
                    is one kind of pressure group. The 1986 legislation, better known as
                    IRCA—Immigration Reform and Control Act—which might have been enacted several
                    years earlier, was stalled by fights between organized agriculture and its
                    interests on the one hand, and the interests of organized labor on the other
                    hand. So you have competing and conflicting interests. The ethnic groups,
                    ummm...which have been around for at least a hundred years...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about from the beginning of our country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, I don't mean the group groups, I mean actual organizations, have
                    always brought a significant level of pressure with regard to family
                    immigration, because family immigration was the traditional immigration up to
                    the time that we started having quantitative limits in the early 1920s. So,
                    there are various things. Rarely, rarely is it a matter—as a Foreign Service
                    officer I regret to say this—but rarely is it a matter of foreign affairs.
                    (laugh) Maybe as topics come up I'll think of examples where foreign affairs
                    were a factor, but it's usually domestic pressure of one kind or another.</p>

                <p>HARPER: Certainly on immigrants.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q. The other part of the visa function is the non-immigrant

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>HARPER: Come to think of it, a non-immigrant instance does come to mind. I wasn't
                    directly involved but because of my position, I was well aware of it. There has
                    long been a humongous mala fide, non-bona fide non-immigrant applicant problem
                    in the Philippines and a consequent high refusal rate. This was taken as sort of
                    an insult to the national pride. At one point, the Foreign Minister or maybe the
                    President informed the Ambassador, that, unless we started to be more reasonable
                    about issuing non-immigrant visas, they would feel compelled to declare the
                    consular section chief persona non grata. The Ambassador, with great equanimity,
                    replied, “Fine, that's certainly within your rights. Of course, if you do I will
                    feel compelled to close the consular section entirely and no visas will be
                    issued.” Case closed. If memory serves, that was when I was Deputy Administrator
                    in 1972-73. Of course it doesn't represent any effective pressure, but it does
                    point up the relationship between visas and foreign relations.</p>
                <p>In another non-immigrant situation, for instance, I was Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary for Visa Services at the time of the Iranian crisis. We had previously
                    tightened up on visa issuances to Iranians ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Specifically this was 1981?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: This was 1979. In February, the revolutionaries had forcibly closed our
                    consulates, burned one or more, as I recall, and we had sort of tightened up at
                    that point. Then in November, when they took the embassy and made all of our
                    colleagues hostages, there was a great deal of scurrying about as to exactly
                    what we would do and how we would do it, and Visa Office was, of course, closely
                    associated with this. Dick Scully, whom I think you have interviewed or will, as
                    our leading officer on regulatory and legislative affairs, drafted up various
                    scenarios and legal documents for the President so he could make a choice as to
                    whether he wanted to use this provision of law or that provision of law or
                    something else to do whatever he might decide to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, principally, what were we trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, the questions were, you know, were we going to continue to admit
                    Iranians who already had visas, were we going to continue to issue them visas,
                    were we going to throw them out of the U.S.? Or any combination of the above.
                    Exactly what were we going to do? What was going to be our policy?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In sort of retaliation, or at least reaction, to what they
                        had done to us?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>HARPER: Well, certainly in reaction. Retaliation is not a good word to use in
                    this context because we were beset with conflicting desires. First of all, of
                    course, we desperately hoped that we would get our troops back in a hurry. I use
                    the term “troops” loosely, in the this case to mean Foreign Service people, and
                    the other U. S. government employees who were there. Secondly, we were in hopes
                    that a more moderate group of Iranians might eventually take over, so we didn't
                    want to do too much damage to those folks. Third, we didn't want to do anything
                    that might, ahhh, my first comment, of course, relates back, that we didn't want
                    to retaliate in any way that would further...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Make it worse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, that would make the situation for our hostages worse. Secondly, we
                    didn't want to do anything that would really make the moderate Iranians'
                    situation worse. And, last but not least, we were always beset by humanitarian
                    concerns; there are a great many ummm... religious minorities in Iran, all of
                    whom were having serious difficulties simply because of the fundamentalist
                    Shiite revolution...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As well as political interests of ours.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Aside from any political interest of ours, just purely humanitarian, we
                    had a problem with respect to those people. So, the question was what would we
                    do? We sent over to the White House these various pieces of paper, these
                    options. The President decided first that the preferable way to handle this was
                    for him to re-delegate his authority under Section 215 of the Immigration Act to
                    the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. Having that in place, when the
                    time came that we (the USG) were a little more sure of exactly what we wanted to
                    do, then we would be in a legal posture to do it quickly. The amusing thing is,
                    it seems he signed this delegation, put a note on it saying, “Do not release
                    this until after consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney
                    General,” but some underling apparently didn't read the note and so released it!
                    (Laugh) And all of a sudden, you know, we're hearing about this Executive Order
                    that the President has signed, which we didn't know the President had signed
                    because there hadn't been this consultation. Well, in any event, although that
                    was in late November, I think, the President didn't finally decide exactly the
                    precise steps he wanted to take until Easter.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Early in the morning, I got a phone call saying, “Mr. Newsom wants you in
                    the office immediately (I live 30 miles away) because the President has decided
                    that we're going to invalidate all visas to Iranians beginning this weekend.” So
                    I called Dick and he and I hurried into my office and began what became a very
                    long day back and forth to Newsom's office with assorted papers, you know, press
                    guidance and specific Q's and A's, (questions and answers), as well as the
                    tentative regulations we had prepared in advance, ready to go whenever needed,
                    once we knew what the decisions were. Naturally they had some holes in them that
                    had to be plugged because we hadn't been quite sure what the decisions would
                    be.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously the Immigration Service is playing a role in

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, the Service was playing a role, except that the Service's role was
                    less than ours at that point because this dealt specifically with visa
                    regulations and they deal with admissions; ...and what the regulations called
                    for when announced was, all outstanding visas, non-immigrant visas, and I
                    believe immigrant visas, at least we considered the question of immigrant visas,
                    ahhh...</p>

                <p>HARPER: Ummm, well, immigrant visas have a short life. They're only valid for
                    four months, whereas non-immigrant visas can be valid for up to ten years, or
                    eternity or whatever and so...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yeah, so there are lots of those outstanding. Any outstanding visa held
                    by an Iranian outside the United States (that particular regulation didn't
                    affect the people here) was invalid as of right that minute, unless and until
                    endorsed by a consular officer on or after—I believe the date was April 7th,
                    1980.</p>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>HARPER: We re-examined, not the basic presidential decision, but the
                    implementation because of these conflicting pressures as to what to do. For
                    example, it's all well and good to say “we're not going to issue any more visas
                    to Iranians.” That's what everybody wanted to do. But you can't do that if
                    you're also worried about the Bahai's and the Jews and the Zoroastrians and the
                    whomevers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or the Shah of Iran who was still alive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Or the Shah of Iran, who I think was paroled in. But in any event,
                    ummm... you know, you can't do those “absolutes”. . So you have exceptions.
                    Well, then the question is, who fits within the exceptions. And it wasn't just
                    exclusively the minority groups, because there were other kinds of humanitarian
                    considerations. What if, for example, somebody's mother is dying, or what if
                    somebody himself is dying and cannot get the treatment he needs in wherever he
                    is, and has to come here for some particular specialist, etc. One of the
                    interesting things was that the President himself personally was making these
                    decisions on what kinds of exceptions. I mean, usually in my experience when
                    things are decided at the White House they are decided by senior staffers. In
                    this case, the stuff we were getting back from the White House said such things
                    as, “the President has decided to exercise option number two and has written a
                    handwritten marginal note...”</p>

                    in the world to them at one time or another. In the early days I was spending
                    more time in David Newsom's office than in my own. When we finally went into
                    action, as it were, on April 7th or 8th or whatever that date was, in order to

                    out. You have no idea how many Iranian students who were attending school in
                    Texas had gone down to Mexico for Easter weekend. And then they got back to the
                    border on Easter Monday, the Monday morning following, and the immigration
                    inspector is saying, “I'm sorry but your visa's been invalidated and you can't
                    return.” “Oh, but I have classes!” This seemed rather hard on the kids but,
                    unless they fell into one of the exception categories, they were out of
                    luck.</p>

                    old folk in between, had been bringing in agricultural workers as
                    non-immigrants, as seasonal workers, since at least the second World War and
                    probably earlier....</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And all legally. On need.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Legally, quite legally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cheap labor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Ummm, well no, not really cheap labor as far as the legal ones were
                    concerned. Illegals were a different matter. The Labor Department had very
                    stringent rules with regard to the amount of money the employer had to pay and
                    the number of hours that the people could be made to work, and the housing that
                    had to be provided, etc. etc.. When Congress was looking at the legislation that
                    was finally enacted in 1986, that is, when they were looking at it earlier in
                    the decade, organized labor people wanted to have all of those Labor Department
                    regulations codified in the law to ummm...ensure that they would have some
                    permanence. After all, regulations can be changed more readily than the law can
                    be changed. Agriculture, of course, that is, the agricultural interests had
                    fought those things being codified as they were, although they thought it was
                    fine for the new law to include them if they were softened one way or
                    another.</p>
                <p>Q; To grant more flexibility?</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>HARPER: To grant more flexibility to the employer, of course. And everything just
                    came to a stalemate. Because the agricultural argument was, “look, you will run
                    us out of business or you will run the prices of American food so high that the
                    American consumer can no longer afford to eat, let alone our exporting
                    anything.” And, meanwhile, labor unions are saying “for crying out loud you guys
                    want to take these jobs at a minimum cost and we've got a lot of American
                    citizen and resident alien field hands who are being displaced by these people.”
                    So you have those conflicting...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a very good example, B. J.. We as people attuned
                        to what was going on then, and you especially, what do you think the
                        American people felt? After all, this was affecting the prices they'd pay
                        for food and other real-life working people issues? What degree do you think
                        the American people knew or cared about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I don't know to what extent they cared, largely because I am confident
                    they didn't know much about it.For example, sometimes I go visit an aunt in
                    southwestern Missouri, a small town about 12,000, I think, and of course I see
                    her friends. Since she's older than I am, for the most part those friends are
                    the children or the grandchildren of her contemporaries because she's outlived
                    most of them. And every time I get in a conversation about immigration, and I
                    should note that although it's a small town, it's not unsophisticated, and these
                    are well-educated, well-traveled people. Anyway, in these conversations, I hear
                    two things, and I hear them both always. The first is that “we're letting too
                    many people in.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that suppose a sort of national chauvinism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: “We're letting too many people in. It's perfectly obvious we're letting
                    too many people in. Look at the number of unemployed we've got. They outnumber
                    the number of people we're letting in.” And the second thing they say is, “But
                    you know, now, there are some young Salvadoran sisters who are here going to
                    school, and they're not in status, and what can you do to regularize their
                    status?”</p>

                <p>HARPER: You know, ahhh...or they don't know somebody who is already here, but
                    they do know somebody who's abroad and has been unable to get a visa, and what
                    can I do to get so-and-so...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That being an example of the constituent interest as we
                        call it, where there is a very explicit case at hand, versus a sweeping
                        generalization of too many people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Exactly. Seemingly everybody in the country, at least everybody in the
                    country that I've ever talked with, knows somebody that they want to come in, or
                    stay in, although they think we're letting too many foreigners in.</p>
                <p>Q; And now particularly for economic reasons?</p>
                <p>HARPER: Usually, one hears about unemployment or other economic reasons.
                    Ahhh...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the ethnic reasons, since we're on how the
                        American people “feel”. Do they feel that maybe there are just too many

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: They've always felt that there are too many foreigners here. And, as far
                    as ethnic bias is concerned, ethnic bias I have traced back to 1728, (laughs)
                    and I have...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1728? (Laughs) That's as far as you went back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That's as far as I went back. Yeah. I think it was 1728, it could have
                    been 1738, for that matter. It was in that general neighborhood and it was in
                    one of the New England colonies, which got very upset about a sudden large
                    influx of Scots. But, you know, we've had anti-Irish, we've had anti-German,
                    we've had anti-ahhh...</p>
                <p>Q; Anti-Catholic...</p>
                <p>HARPER: We had that great sweeping “Know-Nothing” party that was just
                    anti-everybody. But do you realize, Bill, that in the very first Washington
                    administration there was a Congressman, I think from Pennsylvania, who
                    introduced legislation to bar all further immigration to the United States on
                    the fascinating, at least to me, ground that we had needed this steady influx of
                    people while we were nation-building and growing, but now that we had the
                    country built...we didn't need any more! This was in 1789 or 90, for heaven's
                    sakes! And then in the middle of the 19th century we had the “Know-Nothing”
                    party that wanted to bar immigration, so, you know, that idea comes and goes.
                    There certainly has been actual racism from time to time in both the immigration
                    laws and in the policies that have implemented the laws, but I think in general
                    it was less racist in the ugly sense and certainly not necessarily associated
                    with color as we now tend to think of racism. It was more ethno-centrism. You
                    know, the country was founded by people from northern Europe or the British
                    Isles, and so, “why don't we sort of stick to our own...”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Once our own get in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yeah, once our own get in. But why don't we sort of limit this to our own
                    kind, so to speak.</p>
                <p>Q; Well, the attitudes were certainly anti-Slavic at one point, and anti-Italian,
                    anti-Mediterranean at another...</p>
                <p>HARPER: It was anti-Mediterranean, no question about it starting around the turn
                    of the 19th-20th century, and, of course, since the 1870s or 80s we had the
                    Chinese Exclusion Acts, and then later the Gentleman's Agreement With Japan to
                    limit their immigration, and then in 1917, we inserted the Asiatic Barred Zone,
                    so...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, to wrap up this particular issue, and it certainly is
                        an important one, you might say there are two parts. One, personal,
                        individual; the Salvadoran nuns who need intervention. It doesn't matter who
                        they are or from where, Asia or wherever. As a constituent I'm going to
                        bring as much pressure on my Congressman as need be. And the second part is
                        the changing, evolving ethnic makeup of our country. From the near only
                        Anglo days, pure British, on through European and now out into Asian. And in
                        part because of the changing laws and social, political and economic
                        realities, Latin American.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yeah, Latin America. By all, ahhh...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, see, I started telling you about ethnic organizations a while ago.
                    Ethnic organizations are the ones who are largely responsible for the fact that
                    the immigration law grants preferences not only to spouses and children of U. S.
                    citizens and resident aliens, but to adult offspring of U. S. citizens...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: And to siblings of U. S. citizens, all under the rubric of reuniting
                    families, although adult members of U. S. families do not actually unite
                    usually.</p>

                <p>HARPER: Well, they're both living within the borders of the United States, but
                    one of them may be living in Seattle and the other one in Miami. But the posture
                    of the ethnic organizations, and I think it's a legitimate posture as far as
                    that's concerned, is that up until such time as immigration sort of got beyond
                    control in the early 1900s, immigration had largely derived from families. I
                    mean, obviously, some people came just independently. Lots of people came
                    independently. But there was also a tradition of some member of a family coming
                    here and then, as soon as he had enough money saved up, sending for other
                    members of the family and so on. Sometimes siblings, sometimes...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Very American tradition. The ethnic groups want to protect this.
                    Moreover, the countries that did not benefit through such provisions, while we
                    had national quotas, and the maximum quota they had was a hundred a year.</p>

                <p>HARPER: Clearly, to those in the know, but not obviously—I mean to the general
                    public. It looked straight-forward unless one followed the shenanigans for
                    determining the quotas. In the 1921 Act (the first quantitative-limitation
                    legislation), the national quotas were set at, I think it was 2%, 2% of the
                    number of foreign-born in the U.S. according to the 1890 census.Think about that
                    30-year-old census. That was chosen, of course, because it was before the big
                    influx from southern Europe in the early 1900s; a deliberate slant toward the
                    earlier settlers. In the 1924 Act, they essentially retained that arrangement to
                    1929, when a new formula was to be put in place. It would have been pretty
                    flagrant to continue using a census from the previous century, so the 1929
                    provision set quotas based on a complicated ratio—it defies explanation, at
                    least by me—between total population and the number of people attributed to each
                    national origin in the U.S. in the 1920 census. That's why they are called
                    “national origins quotas”. By shifting the basis from “foreign-born” to
                    “national origin” you would continue to give the edge to the earliest settlers,
                    not the newer-comers. From the standpoint of public understanding, however, the
                    fact is, if something is described as a result of some mathematical calculation,
                    it sounds legitimate—sort of an Act of God that Great Britain wound up with
                    65,000 and Italy with 5,500—but in fact the choice of what would go into the
                    calculation was based on arriving at disparities like that. Of course, the
                    public, in those days, would probably have approved of what result if they did
                    understand it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, we've had complaints about brain drain from time to time. But in
                    this context—and some others—most of all what they wanted was for us to not stop
                    their people from coming. Governments interceding to be sure that we didn't do
                    anything to interrupt the flow of their people to the United States. You know,
                    there are members of Congress (and other people, I'm sure) who believe that once
                    children grow up and leave the family home, the family ties are loosened—that
                    “family” really means (or should mean, in the immigration context) just mama,
                    papa and minor children. As an only child, I can't attest one way or the other
                    on this, although I have many, many friends past middle age who are as close to
                    their siblings, and their parents, if alive, as they were when they were young,
                    so the so-called “nuclear family” doesn't apply to everyone. In connection with
                    foreign government intercessions, it must be remembered that many of our people
                    come from countries in which extended families are very close, emotionally even
                    if not in distance, just like the friends I mentioned. I mentioned awhile ago
                    that frequently adult members of immigrant families do not settle where the
                    petitioning relative lives (although many others do), but being in the same
                    country is very important to these people. And to their governments.</p>

                    neither do the people from Liberia for the most part. But, as a for instance,
                    when the '65 act was under consideration, and most particularly when it was
                    under consideration to ummm...impose a numerical ceiling on the Western
                    Hemisphere contrary to all of past history, the Canadians came down and said,
                    “Hey, wait a minute folks, this will cause grave damage to the way we conduct
                    our business across the borders, our traditionally open border. It will
                    interfere with traditional movements for international groups such as
                    international labor organizations, international firms, etc.” And at the time we
                    didn't pay much attention to it because in the '65 act the imposition of a
                    ceiling on Western Hemisphere countries was deferred for three years while a
                    Select Commission on Western Hemisphere Immigration studied the question of
                    whether or not we should have such a limit. And...</p>

                    the labor certification. So, then the Commission did finally decide that, well,
                    the '65 Act essentially was designed to eliminate bias. To eliminate prejudice,

                <p>HARPER: No. No, we could operate however we wanted, but their position was, “the
                    purpose of the '65 Act is to provide a level playing field. And...it won't be a
                    level playing field if a whole hemisphere is exempt from the rules for the rest
                    of the world.” I mean, you know, we're evening-out what we used to do with
                    regard to Europe, and Asia, and Africa; if we leave the Western Hemisphere alone
                    it just stands out like a sore thumb.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That's right. When the Commission decided that well, they would let the
                    limit...I should note it wasn't a matter of affirmative legislation being
                    required; they didn't have to enact anything in order for the limitation to go
                    in on the Western Hemisphere. A limit of 120,000 per annum, effective July 1,
                    1968, was established by the '65 Act, “unless legislation to the contrary is
                    enacted before that date.” All the Congress had to do was fail to act to avoid
                    it. And they deliberately failed to act. They came to the conclusion that
                    discrimination for was as bad as discrimination against. After we had had about
                    a year of this limitation, say 1969, the Canadians were back and they said, “You
                    remember we were down here a couple of years ago telling you that all sorts of
                    dire things would happen? Well, all sorts of dire things are happening.” Prior
                    to this, when Canadians didn't need any visa numbers in order to come here, if a
                    firm or organization wanted to transfer somebody to a U. S. office, all the
                    employee did was get an immigrant visa even though the person might be expected
                    to stay here only a year or two. There was no appropriate non-immigrant
                    classification but an immigrant visa was no problem. If an International union
                    wanted to transfer somebody from the union headquarters in Montreal to the union
                    headquarters in Detroit or vice versa, The person just got an immigrant visa and
                    went across and that was that. Once you had a numerical limitation, and the
                    numbers were not available, you couldn't do that. So what they wanted was a
                    provision that would enable the same kind of free transfer to go on that had
                    gone on in the past.</p>

                    Ummm...I had left Field Op's. Anyway, I didn't participate directly in any of
                    the negotiations, but, as a result of them, we developed what became known as
                    the intra-company transferee non-immigrant provision. Well, I was very pleased
                    to see the development of non-immigrant legislation in the Department, because I
                    had had a pet peeve for a number of years that could maybe taken care of. When I
                    was serving in Japan, and most particularly when I was serving in Okinawa, I was
                    very distressed by the marriage cases that we had. Lots of young soldiers,
                    sailors, whatever, in many instances trying to marry women who were much older
                    and more experienced than they. And there were two problems; actually one of the
                    two problems solved the other problem. The first was that I was personally
                    disturbed by the thought that many of these marriages would not be lasting
                    marriages, and that there would be a great deal of heartache and agony once
                    these women went to the United States as the spouse of these kids. And they were
                    kids. The other problem, however, was that a great many of their military
                    commanders were refusing them permission to marry, usually on the grounds that,
                    if they granted permission, I would deny a visa. That was an argument that I
                    wasn't real thrilled with. The kids would come in and say, “My Commanding
                    Officer tells me that you wouldn't issue my wife a visa if he gave me permission
                    to marry.” I wasn't happy with that either. I thought it was unfair, and I felt
                    very strongly that what we needed was a non-immigrant provision to allow fiances
                    of American citizens to come to the United States, let them see mama, let them
                    get acquainted with mama, let the kids compare them with the girls back home,
                    before marriage.</p>

                    while ago on the lead actors in the '65 Act, one being as the brother of the
                    President, you probably meant the Senator. I found myself working indirectly for
                    the other brother of the President, the A.G. [Attorney General], in '62. You may
                    recall that in 1962 there was this huge rush of around 150,000 or 250,000 or
                    whatever it was, a half million Chinese had crossed the border into Hong Kong.
                    Bobby Kennedy decided to have a refugee program to help out our friends the
                    British, who really had their problems. Another foreign relations factor. But I
                    disagree. The Brits really had their hands full, because Hong Kong had gone from
                    a few hundred thousand to over 2 million in about 15 years. And, obviously, you
                    don't have the infrastructure, you don't have the space, you don't have the

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>HARPER: Well, immigration officers still adjudicate refugee status, and they did
                    then. But what we did was determine eligibility for a visa. The immigration
                    officer then decided whether or not the individual was a refugee.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't have to determine whether that person

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I wasn't determining refugee bona fides, I was determining admissibility
                    to the United States. And it was at a time of enormous immigration fraud. We've
                    always had this enormous immigration fraud from China, so the questions of
                    ummm...whether or not somebody was really entitled to a visa was a very serious
                    question.</p>

                        Tuberculosis...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I didn't have too many health refusals, really. The chief problem was
                    attempted fraud. As you know, there are always more refugees than the U.S. can
                    take care of, so we have to select among them, and that was true then. We were
                    taking as refugees only persons who had family ties in the United States and the
                    principal fraud was in the area of relationships. Many of them were already the
                    beneficiaries of relative preference petitions, but with the quota for Chinese
                    persons being 105 a year, it was very difficult for anyone to get an immigrant
                    visa. So the refugee program was a God-send to relatives and alleged relatives.
                    There was a lot of attempted fraud with regard to claimed relationships, some of
                    which came from the fact that the relative in the U.S. was here in phony
                    identity or status. There was a marvelous fraud report that Hong Kong had done a
                    few years earlier in which the second paragraph (if memory serves) began along
                    these lines: “If all the Chinese who claimed to have been born in San Francisco
                    before the 1906 fire destroyed all records had actually been born in San
                    Francisco, every Chinese woman in the U.S. would have had to have been in San
                    Francisco and to have had 613 children” or some such figure. Anyway, the
                    original commitment, which I think was for 5 or 10 thousand, was increased and
                    our 90-day assignments became six months.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've mentioned a couple of leaders. It sounds like the
                        principal role-players outside of Congress tended to be in the State
                        Department. Although you mentioned Newsom and the Secretary, they appear to
                        be at your level when you were Deputy Assistant Secretary, or above you at
                        the assistant secretary for consular affairs level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: It seems to me the principal player, or two principal players, depends in
                    very large part on who's at the top of INS. Because, we have had varying degrees
                    of leadership out of the Immigration Service, as well as here at State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We remind the reader that the Attorney General isn't just
                        a casual player. He is a primary player under the law.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: He and the Secretary are primary players under the law. But, insofar as
                    day in day out, how is the law implemented, how does the law work and so on, you
                    were right. It's at the assistant secretary, my boss's, not mine particularly,
                    assistant secretary's level and the commissioner of the Immigration Service and
                    we have had varying levels of leadership in each of those positions at one time
                    or another. Therefore, sometimes we were one of two, sometimes we were one of
                    one, and sometimes we were secondary, depending on who's there. Barbara Watson
                    became Administrator, following Abba. Oh, I think there was an interregnum of
                    somebody else who was in there for maybe a year, year and a half, but who's
                    name...</p>

                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>HARPER: It was a short period. Obviously made a huge impression on me because I
                    can't remember. (Laughs)</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: There was some gentleman there for a relatively brief period. Barbara
                    came along, and Barbara was a very unique woman. I loved her dearly.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I would say Barbara came in probably late 1966, or early '67, as a deputy
                    to this other individual, and then took over from him in late '67.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was clearly a democratic Kennedy appointee.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Oh, she was a Johnson appointee.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In New York.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: In New York primarily, but not exclusively. Barbara, like all of the
                    political appointees who held the position, was an attorney. Unlike any other
                    Administrator, or who's title has now changed to Assistant Secretary, unlike any
                    other I have known, she is the only one who went over the Foreign Service
                    Institute, took the consular course, and insisted on taking the examinations and
                    having them graded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And made public?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I assume so, 'tho I never saw them. I know of no other administrator or
                    assistant secretary who's done that. So she really knew what we were talking
                    about when we were talking technicalities, and nobody could touch Barbara when
                    it came to the political factors at play.</p>

                <p>HARPER: She was well plugged in and had been plugged in all of her life to
                    politics. She was wonderful. I remember one time...I don't know why, but for
                    some reason Barbara decided that I was an efficiency expert or some such thing,
                    because she kept sending me all over the world to look at posts, primarily those
                    that were coming in with pleas for more personnel, to see whether they really
                    needed more personnel or whether they just needed to use the ones they had more
                    efficiently. And effectively.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I was in VO. And I was, at that time, chief of the Field Operations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is quite a responsibility.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, but usually try to solve posts' problems from long distance. We
                    don't go traveling off to Timbuckthree (sic) to find out!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Barbara was a hands-on person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Indeed, Barbara was a hands-on person. But, you know, but we found out
                    how posts were doing through these consular conferences such as the one that I
                    mentioned I had seen Abba at, several years earlier. We didn't actually send
                    people out to sort of inspect, outside the Inspection Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Assist. (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Anyway, I went on all of these sort of field management trips, and on one
                    occasion—it was at the time that Lyndon Johnson started to worry about our
                    balance of payments, and had that program called BALPA, which stood for the
                    balance of payments problem. He sent out instructions that large posts abroad
                    were going to suffer a 25 percent cut, and small posts were going to take a 10
                    percent cut in personnel. I got this wonderful news as I was on route to Manila
                    for an around the world, eight-post seven-week trip. Naturally, instead of
                    spending my time in consular sections, trying to find out how people were doing
                    things and whether or not there was a better way to do it, I was spending my
                    time with ambassadors telling them that they really couldn't cut the consular
                    section by 25 percent or 10 percent or whatever percent—(laugh) a message that
                    never thrilled any of them.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And an issue that goes on to this day.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: And an issue that goes on to this day. Well, anyhow, I got as far as
                    Madrid, which was my next to the last stop. It was late on a Friday afternoon,
                    and so, of course, I didn't see the ambassador that day. I spent a very pleasant
                    weekend in Spain; as I'd never been in Spain before, after Saturday at the
                    Prado, I ran down to Toledo on Sunday, looking forward to working with the
                    consular section two or three days of the following week and then going on up to
                    Lisbon, or over to Lisbon—whatever direction it is. Geography is not my long
                    suit. As I walked into the embassy bright and early Monday, a young man,
                    apparently in our communications section, stopped me in the corridor, and said,
                    “Excuse me, but are you Ms. Harper?” and when I said, yes, he said, “I have a
                    cable for you.” So I thanked him, took my cable, pushed the elevator button for
                    the ambassador's office floor to pay a courtesy call, and read the cable en
                    route. I couldn't believe my eyes. What it said was, “your services urgently
                    needed in Department. Curtail itinerary and return ASAP”. So I was in this total
                    bewilderment walking into the ambassador's room when the secretary announced my
                    arrival and he came out...it was Angier Biddle Duke...this great tall man came
                    striding out of his office and said, “What do you do in the Department that's so
                    important?” (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More important that I am, apparently! (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I said, “Mr. Ambassador, I swear I have no idea!” He said, “Well, I don't
                    want you to leave, I mean we've got problems down in the consular section, and I
                    really don't want you to leave early.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I won't let you out of the country! (laugh)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, since I didn't want to leave early, I said, “If you don't mind my
                    using your phone, I'll try to find out.” So I called George Owen, the director
                    of the Visa Office and my immediate boss, and said, “George, what is this?” He
                    replied, “B. J., I didn't know anything about that cable until I saw a comeback
                    copy. Barbara sent it.” “But why did Barbara send it? I mean okay, she should
                    have cleared it with you, but what's the problem?” “The problem is she has to go
                    up and testify in three weeks and she wants you back here to write her testimony
                    and to go with her to testify.” So, yes, Barbara was hands on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Who knows! It was an oversight...</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>Q; Because usually she could handle such items; and there were others around—not
                    to take away from your importance—but she knew how to use the Dick Scullys and
                    the George Owens...</p>
                <p>HARPER: But, this would have been '68. Dick was fairly new at that point. Dick
                    didn't come into VO until late '67, as I recall; and although obviously he was a
                    real comer, I'd been around for a while. She was used to me.</p>
                <p>Q; You know that now more in retrospect than perhaps at the time. But you were
                    needed. It also emphasizes...</p>
                <p>HARPER: The one thing, I told the ambassador, “there's one thing for sure. I
                    don't know what this cable means and I don't know why it was sent, but I do know
                    that I am going to insist it go in my personnel file for the benefit of the
                    promotion boards”. (laughs)Q: To compensate for what you're going to write on me
                    for fleeing the post! But I think also, that it reflects Barbara's sense of
                    priorities. She knew what was coming up on the Hill. The Hill is very, very
                    important, and she knew it. Not just because they're congressmen, but because
                    they are the leading players in immigration matters. The Constitution suggests
                    that. And that she wanted to make sure she was fully prepared, so you were
                    ordered back.</p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, it was an oversight hearing. And they tend to ask a lot of picky
                    type questions. You know, exactly how are you doing, X, Y or Z? And she really
                    needed a backup at her elbow.</p>

                        Speaking in general terms, what do you think is a weak leader; what are the
                        qualities missing in some of our other leaders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, ummm...there have been those, as I suggested a few minutes ago,
                    some of our leaders have simply not known enough technically to feel comfortable
                    or to see the implications, and even though they can be led to an understanding
                    of the implications, they're not comfortable going up and defending or making an
                    issue of certain things, or whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They can't always pass on a question that comes in on the

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Exactly. So that's one kind of a problem, that sometimes there is a
                    shortage, shall we say, of adequate technical skill. The opposite kind of a
                    problem has also been known to arise, where a person just simply doesn't like,
                    doesn't cotton to, isn't comfortable with, politics. The give-and-take of
                    politics.</p>

                        about leadership with the field? The junior officers, for example, that vast
                        number of people on the visa lines, suffering under pressures, and maybe bad
                        local leadership. How do you look at the relationship with the field? For
                        example, from your position as director of Field Operations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Ms. Harper; Well, I was division chief of Field Operations, what, 30 something
                    years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Same “field” was out there!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Same field. A much larger field, as a matter of fact. You said “local”
                    but then referred to my being in Field Ops. I'm not sure whether you really
                    meant leadership in the field as I saw it from Field Ops and other departmental
                    assignments, or between the field and Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Both, or either. Whatever suits you...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>HARPER: Actually, they're intertwined, at least to the extent that it's a lot
                    easier to be a good leader in the field if you're getting support from
                    Headquarters. I'd say generally that both are pretty good. In fact, most of the
                    senior consular officers abroad, visa officers, are a lot better than pretty
                    good, both managerially and technically, and some are outstanding. Moreover, I
                    think VO does a better than pretty good job of backstopping them. On the other
                    hand, I have occasionally seen examples of some—I don't know how to describe it
                    really—sometimes it seems to me the folks in the field are not using their
                    common sense. I'm as great stickler for following the law as anyone, but
                    sometimes, particularly with regard to subjective judgments, a certain element
                    of balance, of common sense is necessary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the expense of the law”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: No, not really. It's pretty hard to establish that there's only one right
                    decision on matters about which two different officers could come to different
                    conclusions, and that's what the subjective decisions amount to, sort of by
                    definition. I'm sure you've had the experience, as a reviewing officer, of
                    coming to a different judgement from that of the interviewing officer and I
                    assume you handled it as I did. You explained to the officer why you had come to
                    your conclusion and if the officer wasn't persuaded, you issued the visa
                    yourself. No one should, actually no one legally can, order an officer to issue
                    (or for that matter, deny) a visa. But we can and should try to educate and we
                    can and should take over a case, if it seems necessary. Fortunately, most of the
                    grounds of ineligibility are objective—someone does or does not have a criminal
                    record, or a disqualifying illness, or a labor certification, or whatever. But
                    the questions such as whether or not someone is a bona fide non-immigrant, or a
                    returning resident, or likely to become a public charge are all subjective. And
                    circumstances may suggest a little flexibility. My memory goes back further than
                    yours I think, in the sense of being in the Service first, and I well remember
                    Congressman Rooney regularly fulminating about “little Caesar”, meaning consular
                    officers. I think we shouldn't do things that give rise to that charge.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course not, but what kinds of things...examples?HARPER:
                        Well...maybe one of each. I mean, one when a senior officer interceded
                        properly in my judgment and one of the opposite. You remember the “Use your
                        heads” airgram I mentioned—the one urging that they postpone scheduling of
                        people who would not be directly affected by the new labor certification
                        after the '65 Act went into effect?</hi>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>HARPER: mostly because it was not understood, but regrettably, in one case,
                    because it was. At a post I won't name, they understood the message perfectly
                    and canceled, or rescheduled, an appointment that had already been made for
                    early November with a couple who were special immigrant returning residents.
                    Just what the airgram meant. However, when the couple came in for the
                    rescheduled appointment, about the 5th of December, the consular officer decided
                    they were not entitled to returning resident status. Now, if the original
                    appointment had been kept, that decision wouldn't have mattered. Whatever status
                    they had, since they were British, a non-preference visa would have been
                    available, the labor certification requirement was not yet in effect, and they
                    would still have been eligible for and been issued visas. Coming to that
                    conclusion under the circumstances, however, was really very unfortunate,
                    because they were no longer eligible to apply for non-preference visas. In that
                    instance, I called and discussed it with the chief of the consular section who
                    re-interviewed them on appeal and decided they were indeed entitled to returning
                    resident status.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You cite that as an example of a leader doing the right
                        thing. Do you think they really were returning residents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Absolutely, it's an example of what I think is the necessary use of
                    common sense. I didn't interview those people and don't really know whether or
                    not they were or weren't...but I'm convinced that it was in our best interest
                    that those visas be issued under those circumstances. After all, they'd have had
                    their visas and been in the U.S. by December if the embassy hadn't changed their
                    appointment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a contrary example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, on the other hand, there have been cases that may have been
                    technically correct under the law that I think were decided in an overly-rigid
                    manner—for example, an infant in a life-threatening situation, needing an
                    immediate evacuation to a hospital that had agreed to provide emergency care,
                    and a consular officer who refused a visa to one of the parents for fear that if
                    both went they wouldn't return. Even in response to a Departmental phone call to
                    the chief of section, that decision was not reversed the last I heard. That's
                    the type of thing I meant. The courts have held that laws cannot be deemed to me
                    meaningless, they have to make sense, and surely we ought to apply the law as if
                    we were thinking about its purpose. I understand concern about bona fides—I
                    refused lots of visas on that basis. But clearly those people did not have a
                    critically ill child just in order to sneak into the United States. That's the
                    kind of handling of a case Congressman Rooney used to rant about, and the kind
                    of case that prompts calls from a Board of Review of visa refusals in the U.S.,
                    which is a terrible idea.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good point. And getting back to leadership, or
                        relationship between the field and Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: As I said, I think generally speaking, relationships are fairly good in
                    the sense that we do provide the kind of help that the posts usually need. On
                    the other hand, the Foreign Affairs Manual, that is, our part of it, Volume 9,
                    is not kept up to date as quickly as it should be, in large part because of
                    mechanics. It used to be amended faster than it is now, because it used to be
                    that in the regulations and legislation division of the Visa Office, we simply
                    made the necessary changes, sent her over to people who photocopied and ran it
                    off, and out it went. Now it has to go from us to a different organization in
                    the Department where they edit it, where they format it, where they try to make
                    our part look like the rest of the Manual, and then they have it printed. And so
                    it is slower. That's one problem. I think another problem is that what this
                    leads to is not necessarily a delay in the people getting the information they
                    need. Let me stress that. What happens, and what has happened as a result, is
                    that everything is going out by telegram, saying the Manual pages will come
                    along sooner or later.</p>

                <p>HARPER: Well, we've always sent urgent materials by cable, that's true, but

                    more of it, so to speak, and the statutory changes require procedural changes. I
                    have recently been trying to update some material, and frequently between the
                    time I start and when I go home at 6:00 at night, what I'm writing about has
                    changed. It's not always necessarily the law but the procedures.</p>

                        They don't know what it's like to be on the line.” Or, to make it even
                        worse, “those civil servants who send us sarcastic telegrams. They just
                        don't understand.” What is your reaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, I have been one of those who wondered whether or not the people in
                    Washington understand, so I can sympathize with that. However, I've never known
                    an assistant secretary who didn't come back from the consular conferences very
                    impressed with the people in the field and insisting that we “do something”
                    about the issues they've raised. Sometimes that's not possible. A lot of the
                    gripes stem from the fact that some consular officer (or officers) don't like
                    some particular provision of law, think it's unwise, or they want more
                    resources...people, equipment, space or whatever. Well, we don't write the law,
                    at least not usually, and we can't testify that some congressman's idea is
                    crummy just because some consular officer doesn't like it. As for resources,
                    anyone who's read the paper in the last few years knows that all agencies are
                    hurting for money. It's been a matter of doing more with less for quite a few
                    years now. But, as I said, we do do what we can. As for the other part of your
                    question, I don't really feel that distinction, at least not in the Visa Office,
                    I don't, between the Foreign Service personnel and the Civil Service personnel.
                    Maybe that's because so many of the people in VO are Foreign Service officers
                    and they have had field experience, and the Civil Service old-timers are real
                    pros.</p>

                <p>HARPER: Classic cables. Francis Knight had a favorite opening phrase when she got
                    angry about somebody's stupidity somewhere. And you could see and hear the
                    underscoring and the italicizing even in a cable, literally as you read it,
                    because the opening sentence would begin, “The Department fails to understand

                <p>HARPER: But, anyway, I don't think they do that in VO. Basically we try to be
                    nice and we try to be helpful. And, thank heaven for things like fax's, speaking
                    of modern technology, and telephones, and things of that nature. An awful lot is
                    done by phone, although that's not convenient if you are in Washington and
                    somebody is in Beijing ahhh... or Tokyo. Or somewhere where the clock is a
                    twelve to fourteen hour difference...</p>

                <p>HARPER: Yeah, exactly, twelve hour's difference. My recollection is that that is
                    the spread between D.C. and Tokyo. No hour is convenient at both ends. I think
                    one problem that we face, however, is that not enough of our troops do have an
                    assignment in VO, and I think it would be useful if every consular officer had
                    to have at least one assignment in VO, preferably after at least one field
                    experience.</p>

                <p>HARPER: Yes, I think it would be helpful for everybody to know how the system
                    works. But most of all I think that we need to do something about our training.
                    We spend an awful lot of time teaching people, “what”? Obviously they do have to

                <p>HARPER: However long it is. I haven't taken that course. I've e taught at it from
                    time to time, but I've never taken it. So we teach them “what”. And we also, to
                    some extent, teach them “how”. It's always seemed to me, however, from the time
                    that I went through the basic A-100 course, you know, umpteen years back, that
                    they do not teach enough “whys”. And I am convinced that people do remember how
                    to do things or at least remember where to look to find out how to do things

                    certification, or the interpretation of various and sundry provisions. Not just
                    this is the interpretation, but this is why we interpreted it this way.</p>

                    redid the whole Manual, I mean Volume 9, in 1985-86. I got through just in time
                    for the '86 Act to be enacted, and I had to redo it after it was in page

                    explained a lot of “we think this because”, or “the Department and the Service

                <p>HARPER: Well, I hope so. I mean I hope they were understood. I also tried to make
                    the notes themselves less interpretable, because it used to be, and you know
                    this from your own experience, Bill, if you opened the book to any given page,
                    and ummm...asked five different consular officers to read note 7.3 and tell you
                    what it meant, you'd get five different answers, if not six. We weren't always
                    careful enough in drafting and I've tried to do something about that. But I
                    think that these are shortcomings that really need to be addressed constantly.
                    All it takes, as you know, is a couple of months of negligence in how you
                    explain things, and you've immediately got 250 or 750 confused consular
                    officers.</p>
                <p>Q; That's right. But unfortunately, the principal people that really know the
                    “why's” for so many of these questions sit in Dick Scully's office in Reg's and
                    Leg's, and are few in number. What, five or six officers? And are under constant
                    pressure because of the changing laws, procedures and interpretations.</p>

                <p>HARPER: I'm thoroughly familiar with the kinds of pressures around, and ...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they're the only ones that know this. Aren't

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, and they, that is, the more junior ones, don't even always know why.
                    They know what, but they don't always know why. They should. But there isn't as
                    much, there isn't time enough for as much communication, even in-house, as there
                    should be. Now, there are staff meetings every week, you know...</p>

                        The phone was ringing. Everybody had their own thing they had to get to.
                        They're all busy people, and not necessarily doubling the staff helps it,
                        because so much of this is just basic knowledge that the field needs to know
                        but just can't get, at least on a timely basis.</hi>

                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, exactly, and there is also the fact that, for the most part, the way
                    the regulations and legislation staff was set up, the senior members of the
                    staff actually made decisions, coordinated with INS, etc., and made decisions as
                    to what we would put in our regulations, how would we interpret jointly this
                    term or that term or the other term, but the rest of the staff essentially
                    simply put into the proper format whatever they were given, either by those
                    superiors, or when it came to procedural notes, that they were given by the
                    people in Field Operations that were developing the procedures. And their's not
                    to reason why.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: The question was, do you understand, the question was, can you put it in
                    procedural notes, you know, here it is. And this led to gaps in knowledge. Now,
                    the people we have there today are more knowledgeable, and are better at this.
                    And they do have sense enough to ask questions, which is the important thing. I
                    mean they've got a good deal of sense, and they are very able people. I don't
                    want to suggest that anybody we've got there right this minute is not.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, we've had over the years, a few people who believed that their sole
                    responsibility was to take what they were given, and plug it in at the right
                    place.</p>

                        and it starts out with a reprimand. Not as bad as Francis Knight's, but it
                        was ahhhh....”you should have known that sort of thing. And then that builds

                <p>HARPER: But....well, I don't know how vast, but in any event, going back to '65
                    and the legislation. I commented that we only had from October 3rd to December
                    1st to get the wheels moving. It is amazing to me, as I look back on it, that
                    when December 1, rolled around, the State Department, meaning the Visa Office,
                    and I believe the Immigration Service, all had regulations that had been duly
                    published according to the precepts of law, in place, in time for the effective
                    date of the legislation. This is because in those day we didn't do things as we
                    do now, like going through OMB; we didn't have all the inter-Agency
                    friction.</p>

                <p>HARPER: No, with, you know, every other agency in the city wanting to look at
                    some particular piece of this thing. It was just by and large the State
                    Department Visa Office and the Immigration Service, the Justice Department's
                    Immigration service...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe Labor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: And, yes, and certainly Labor in '65, because of the labor certification
                    provision. We would simply pick up the phone and say, “we're proposing to do
                    'X'. Do you have any problem with that?” “No, and as a matter of fact, we're
                    planning to do 'Y'”, the person you were talking to would answer! And so, we all
                    went ahead and blithely published our regulations. There were no crashing
                    conflicts between us or among us, and, therefore, everything was handy-dandy.
                    Now, the 1990 legislation, on the other hand, was enacted in November, 1990,
                    effective October 1, 1991...</p>

                <p>HARPER: The Visa Office had its regulations out by October 1, for October 1,
                    1991, except for two that we had been unable to get through OMB. INS had not yet
                    published its regulations on these subjects, and it had the primary
                    responsibility for those provisions, and, therefore, OMB wouldn't let us publish
                    our regulations first. The Service was still putting out interim
                    regulations.</p>
                <p>Q; Which were maybe contrary to what you were going to..</p>
                <p>HARPER: No, they weren't contrary. We were all agreed on everything.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Substantively there were no problems. Our regulations didn't say anything
                    other than an alien entitled to be classified, or consular officers can classify
                    an alien as a such-and-such kind of non-immigrant, if the consular post has
                    received a petition of approved by the Immigration Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which they hadn't?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Harper: Well, you know, as a matter of logic, whether or not they had
                    published their regulations, if all our regulations say is, “if the Service
                    sends you an approved petition, you accept it,” we don't have any problem with
                    our regulations. They're not going to be in conflict with INS reg's because we
                    don't say anything substantive. Nonetheless, OMB wouldn't let us publish them
                    because the Service hadn't published their regulations yet, saying what their
                    criteria for approval would be. You asked me a few minutes ago, Bill, about
                    getting back to 1965, and you know, where had I'd gone since then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, like what have you done since then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: What have I done since then.. Yes, exactly, well, I stayed in the Visa
                    Office for a longer period than usual, making my way sort of gradually up the
                    line from Deputy Director of Regulations and Legislation, to Chief of the Field
                    Operations Division and then Deputy Director of VO. From Deputy Director, I went
                    to the Senior Seminar in Foreign Policy. Wonderful year. I thought it was the
                    best year I had ever spent in the Foreign Service.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, 1971, all these other...right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I had spent a year or two in all of these other functions, and running
                    around the world at Barbara's insistence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And being called back at Barbara's insistence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: And being called back at Barbara's insistence. But, you know, again
                    interrupting myself, Barbara provided me with such extraordinary opportunities,
                    such as the ones that I've mentioned of developing some management expertise by
                    going to both well-run and badly-run posts and learning the difference. Of going
                    up on the Hill and actually being the co-testifier, getting acquainted with the
                    Members of Congress, not just the staffers, and you know, it's a tremendous
                    development schedule.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me interrupt you, because you have said something
                        explicitly that I think needs at least a paragraph of detail: the role of
                        Congress. Congress is lambasted left and right, for all of it's
                        incompetencies, but you and I know that there's some good guys out there.
                        Would you summarize your views with that period a particularly good one to
                        concentrate on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, it was a good period. And, I think in general, Congress,
                    ahhh...it's hard to describe Congress's role. The Supreme Court decided in the
                    1870s that Congress had primary power over immigration under the Commerce
                    Clause. It is a role that they have guarded jealously. Very jealously. So that,
                    for instance, when Jimmy Carter named a working group on immigration, in '78,
                    the Congress immediately enacted a Select Commission on Immigration to replace
                    it, on which they would have four members. That sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it's true! It isn't politics, it's legal!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: It isn't politics, so much as a certain amount of ummm...turf
                    consciousness. We had as Chairman, Pete Rodino; actually he wasn't chairman of
                    the full committee in the late 1960s, he was Chairman of the Immigration
                    subcommittee, but he was Mr. Immigration. And Ted Kennedy was very active in the
                    Senate. The House, however, was far more active with respect to immigration
                    legislation than the Senate was. Jim Eastland chaired the Judiciary Committee
                    for the Senate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In title only.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>HARPER: Couldn't have cared less about immigration, except, of course, to keep
                    immigrants out. And one of the most extraordinary things in the world was the
                    way the Immigration Act of 1965 passed, because it went over to the Senate the
                    day before they were adjourning, and it didn't go to hearings, it didn't go to
                    anything that would delay it, it went directly to the floor and it was passed by
                    the Senate. What do you know, we had new legislation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Eastland out sick that day?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I really don't know what happened to the chairman, but in any event,
                    there we were. Of course there had been hearings earlier; the bill was
                    introduced in 1963, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Mr. Kennedy had a role in that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: It was a Kennedy Administration bill. But regarding the Congress—the
                    staff is usually very knowledgeable, but the individual members, for the most
                    part, are not. The chairman was certainly, Pete Rodino was very knowledgeable.
                    Some of the members—Ham Fish is the ranking Republican, and he is very
                    knowledgeable. I mean, he actually understands the nuts and bolts. And it's the
                    nuts and bolts that so many don't understand. They understand the policies but
                    they don't understand how the policies work in actual practice. They are
                    astounded when they find out that what they have enacted won't work as expected,
                    which is to say, without pain for anyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No pain, no gain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Exactly. There's a conflict between the sense that we have to have
                    numerical limits and an apparent reluctance or simple failure to recognize the
                    fact that limits imply waiting lists. After all, if there weren't more people
                    who want to come than we want to let in we wouldn't need any limits. In any
                    event, they worry about waiting lists...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it shows up in legislation...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>HARPER: Sure. For example, in considering the 1990 legislation they were faced
                    with the usual array of conflicting desires. One was to relieve the terrible
                    backlogs in the second preference, which as you know is for the spouses and
                    unmarried sons and daughters of lawful permanent resident aliens. World-wide
                    there was a substantial waiting period, I believe about two or three years, but
                    in the high-demands countries where immigration was restricted by the
                    per-country ceiling, the wait was as long as eight to ten years. They wanted to
                    cure that, to level out the waiting period for everybody. So they wrote a
                    provision that gave 75% of the second preference numbers to the spouses and
                    children (not unmarried sons and daughters) on the basis of not being counted
                    against the per-country ceiling. That worked fine, as far as relieving the
                    pressures in the high-demand countries was concerned. It also, however, reduced
                    the number of visas available for such spouses and kids from the rest of the
                    world, thus making their waiting longer, which immediately generated a flood of
                    correspondence from constituents howling about those increased delays.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They don't like howls from constituents...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: No, they don't. Moreover, getting back to my point, they don't always
                    understand even the Constitution. I remember informing a member of Congress, on
                    one occasion, when I was so taken aback by something...actually he was being
                    rather ugly about the kinds of people we ought to be throwing out of the
                    country, and why did we have to have all of these procedures and what-not, so I
                    reminded him that under the 14th Amendment these people were entitled to all of
                    the same procedural privileges as U.S. citizens under the Constitution of the
                    United States, and he was astounded to learn that. So, you know, they come in
                    all sizes and varieties and, but by and large, our relationship with the
                    Congress has usually been pretty...I can't say chummy, but, you know,
                    cordial...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Professional?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Professional. And frequently downright cordial. We work very closely with
                    the staff, and that helps. I mean that really does help to inform the
                    legislation. As you know, time and again I have gone up to the Hill, Dick has
                    gone up there, others have gone up there, and explained why section
                    such-and-such of proposed legislation will not do, and cannot, in any which way,
                    do what the sponsor of that section intends.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And INS is responding in their own way for their own

                <p>HARPER: And INS is doing the same thing. We do not go up and talk policy. We're
                    prohibited by law from lobbying, I think we're prohibited from lobbying the
                    Congress, so we don't go up and tell them that, gee whiz, you really gotta do X,
                    Y or Z. We do go up and offer technical guidance, and...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Usually visa oriented. With regard to lobbying, now we don't exactly
                    lobby the Congress, but we do occasionally submit legislation, proposed
                    legislation to them.</p>

                <p>HARPER: As the Executive Branch does all the time, and obviously we tell them why
                    we think it would be a good thing to do. If we didn't think it was a good thing
                    to do, we wouldn't be recommending it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: We try to make them clear; we're never sure that they do fully understand
                    them, but then...sometimes when we testify about the fact that a certain
                    provision, if enacted, would require additional resources, there seems to be
                    something of an attitude of “our job is to enact legislation and yours is to
                    implement it, so I”m sure you'll find a way.” That's why we've had so much
                    “doing more with less”.</p>

                        look at something like this today?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I'm not sure why. I think that by and large ummm...there has seemed to be
                    an attitude in Congress over the years, and as far back as I can remember, to
                    the 60s, that the Service did not function as well as the Foreign Service. The
                    Immigration Service did not function well.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: In general. They get more complaints about the way the Immigration
                    Service does this, that, or the other than they do about the way we have done
                    this, that, or the other. And, therefore, they have been reluctant to cut us
                    out. As you may recall, Bill—of course if you're overseas you don't recall these
                    things too well 'cause you don't always hear them, but—there have been several
                    executive reorganization plans which would have meshed either all or part of the
                    Visa Office with the Immigration Service and the Congress has routinely shot
                    them down. Another example was their repeated refusal to enact a non-immigrant
                    visa waiver. They didn't want aliens coming here without a pre-screening by a
                    consular officer. When I was consultant to Assistant Secretary Diego
                    Asencio...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: The early 1980s. He followed Barbara, who left to become ambassador to
                    Malaysia in, I think, October or maybe November 1980. As I started to say, we
                    were working very hard to get a visa waiver provision included in what became
                    IRCA. Actually, we had been trying to get such a provision, as a piece of
                    Department-sponsored legislation, since the late 1960s or maybe 1970s, But after
                    the massacre at the Berlin Olympics in 1972, Barbara decided we should drop the
                    issue...that the concern about terrorists was too great for that to be a good
                    idea. It was introduced by various members in the intervening years and we
                    actually testified against it. Then, in the late 1979—this is something of a
                    digression, but it's a reflection of how things work—OMB asked us to do a study
                    of what savings could be achieved with a visa waiver for nationals of countries
                    who did not pose a serious threat with regard to over-staying and working
                    illegally. Our study showed something like 20 officer positions, another 80 or
                    so local employee positions, and something over two million dollars. Although no
                    such legislation had been enacted or was even under serious consideration, they
                    promptly cut our proposed budget by that much. So as soon as possible we sent
                    such a provision up to the Hill as a legislative proposal. And worked very hard
                    for it. One of our selling points was the effect the non-immigrant visa
                    requirement was having on our relations with some of our closest allies. Lord
                    Carrington was British Foreign Minister at the time and he brought it up
                    personally with the Secretary on more than one occasion. “Why do you require
                    visas for our people when we let Americans in without them?” That's one time the
                    foreign relations factor was useful.</p>

                <p>HARPER: Well, all we got at the time was a pilot program, limited to eight
                    countries, but it has since been expanded. Anyway, maybe they've changed their
                    minds in the last few years about the Service, I don't know, but I rather doubt
                    it. And I think that would ahhh...</p>

                    foreign relations, than the movement of people across international borders. And
                    anyone in the Department of State who looks at it purely as a resource problem,
                    without taking into account the impact of foreign relations, is kidding himself,
                    or herself, as the case may be. Even the Secretary has sometimes had his
                    attention brought sharply to that fact. I remember well a not very happy
                    experience with Cy Vance because I had revoked the visa of a South African
                    boxer. You remember that if it is found that a person was not eligible for the
                    visa, after he or she has already arrived in the United States, the visa must be
                    revoked by a senior officer here, not the consular officer who issued it.
                    Frankly, I don't remember the details very well and they aren't important anyway
                    in this connection. What I do remember extremely well is Barbara suddenly
                    hurrying into my office about 6:30 one evening saying, “The Secretary wants to
                    see us right now! I don't know why, but it's clear he's not happy.” So we raced
                    up to the 7th floor, stopping en route to pick up our legal advisor...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not your personal legal advisor, but your professional
                        one?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That's right, Bob Dalton, the Consular Affairs bureau legal advisor.
                    Hodding Carter, the Department's spokesman was sitting in the corner of the
                    Secretary's office with a bemused expression on his face, Vance was at his desk
                    waving us to an adjacent sofa, and he was livid. He greeted us by banging his
                    fist on the desk and shouting, “Doesn't anyone else ever understand the pig
                    picture?” Well, what big picture? Turns out that Pete Botha (South African
                    Foreign Minister at the time) had been ringing the Secretary's phone off the
                    hook all day, protesting what he considered outrageous behavior toward a South
                    African hero. A boxer, yet! As I said, the particulars of the case aren't
                    germane to this discussion, and the Secretary did finally calm down enough to
                    listen to why we had to do what we had done. The point is, it's a splendid
                    example of the top management sometimes learning what I was just saying—the
                    movement of people across national borders can, and frequently does, affect
                    foreign relations. “The big Picture”, indeed! That's 30-40 minutes I'll never
                    forget.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in the end he understood that you not only knew the
                        big picture, but he was going to know the little picture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: He was going to know the little picture, exactly. Anyway, getting back to
                    the...my career, such as it was, I went to the Senior Seminar. A wonderful year
                    as I said. One of the things the system asks you, of course, one of the things
                    they ask you every year, is what do you want to do next? I had said that I
                    wanted to do either of two things. I would like to be deputy chief of mission in
                    a small embassy, relatively small embassy, because that time Barbara had
                    persuaded me that I was a management specialist, and that's what DCM's do, for
                    the most part (laughs). This was before Cy Vance. This was back in the early
                    70s. The big picture came along later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're supposed to get that at the Senior Seminar
                        (laughs).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, and the other thing I wanted...yeah I had learned the big picture at
                    the seminar, for heaven's sake, but the Secretary wouldn't let me tell him so.
                    The other thing I wanted, alternatively, was to be consul general in a fairly
                    major post, in an independent post. I did not want to be consulate general in an
                    embassy. I wanted to be consul general in an independent post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like Montreal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: And, not least, I wanted some place with good medical facilities, because
                    the Aunt who lived with me was not in good health. My father had died in the
                    meantime, and my own medical clearance was limited to places that were low level
                    altitude and good medical facilities. So all of a sudden I was asked if I would
                    mind being Deputy Administrator for a year, because Toronto and Montreal were
                    coming up a year later, and one of Barbara's deputies, Fred Smith, wanted to go
                    off for a year's senior training. They couldn't let Fred go to senior training
                    without a backup, so it would mesh if I went into Fred's job for a year, and
                    then went up to Canada. That struck me as splendid, and a year later I went to
                    Montreal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Barbara hadn't left by then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: No, Barbara was still there. She stayed through the Nixon administration,
                    and it wasn't until Jerry Ford was president, and a Republican attorney with
                    political ties wanted the job, that Barbara's resignation, her formal
                    resignation submitted with a change of administration, was accepted, and so she
                    left.</p>

                        series.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yeah, Len Walentynowicz came in. I went up to Montreal...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After your year as Deputy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: After the year as Deputy Administrator. We were still “administrators” in
                    those days. Then, while I was in Montreal, they changed the title to Assistant
                    Secretary. Meanwhile, we changed administrations. I was in Montreal through a
                    fascinating five years. The day that I arrived in Montreal was the day after a
                    general election, provincial election, and the Liberal Party had swept in with
                    something like 103 seats out a 110, or numbers in that neighborhood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Bourassa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yeah, Robert Bourassa. I was there for the Olympics in '76, I was there
                    for the elections in '76 at which the Qu�b�cois...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's a “Qu�b�cois?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: The Parti Qu�b�cois was the political party seeking an independent
                    Quebec. It swung into just about the same size majority as the Liberals had
                    three years earlier, and it was all a very fascinating time to have been
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a lot of visa issues during the Olympics
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: We had lots of visas, we had lots of visitors, we had lots of everything.
                    I don't know if you know, but Henry Kissinger's very fond of wrestling. The only
                    thing for which the Secretary wanted tickets was the Greco-Roman wrestling. But,
                    we had lots of other VIPs; for instance Secretary of Treasury Simon came up. He
                    was interested in all sorts of sports, and oh, we had an enormous influx.</p>
                <p>

                        whatever you want to call it But there might be some people using the
                        Olympics to enter the back door of the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that turn out to be a reality?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: We had thought it would be, that lots of foreign visitors to the Olympics
                    would suddenly discover how close the U.S. was to Montreal and seek visas, but
                    the volume wasn't as great as we had feared. Anyway, that was a problem for Bill
                    Maule, the new consular section chief. I was spending my time trying to find out
                    for the Department, from my good friend Roger Rousseau, chairman of the Olympics
                    Organization Committee, whether or not the Canadians were going to admit the PRC
                    (People's Republic of China) to the Games and unseat, so to speak the
                    Taiwanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: You know, the funny thing is...although I spent more hours than I want to
                    recall on that issue, I don't really remember. I think that may have been the
                    year that both teams were admitted—to the satisfaction of neither.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of those things, even by you, have been forgotten, in
                        part. But the memory of the Olympics stays on, as you know, because the
                        physical location, and all that went with it, is still there and is still
                        lovely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Ms. Harper: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And as a matter of fact, recently—as recent as this
                        morning—there was an newspaper article, I don't know if you saw it or not,
                        condemning our present exhibit in Barcelona. And, compared the “theme
                        monument” to the one by Buckminster Fuller, a beautiful round ball, which
                        later burned down, but the frame work fortunately stayed up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: It burnt, I watched it burn down. I watched it burn down from the window
                    of my office, as a matter of fact. But to get back to the chronology, I went up
                    to Montreal, and had these five wonderful years, at which point I asked for a
                    further extension. I was within a year and a half of mandatory retirement. So I
                    asked if I couldn't stay until then, and the reaction of the Department was
                    two-fold. One, B. J., you have already stretched...</p>

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>HARPER: You have already stretched beyond reason an assignment to one of the best
                    posts in the Foreign Service, and there are other people who would like to go
                    there. Moreover, even if we wanted to be sympathetic, we can't be because
                    Barbara Watson insists that you come back as her deputy by September. Barbara,
                    once Jimmy Carter took over from President Ford, was promptly reappointed and
                    was back as assistant secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So she was only away for the three years roughly that
                        Walentynowicz was in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yeah, I would have thought it was even less than that. But yes, however
                    long it was that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She came back with the proviso that Francis Knight be
                        gotten rid of. (laughs) And it didn't work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I must say, I never heard of that proviso, because Francis was certainly
                    still around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Barbara, God rest her soul, told me that. That she came
                        back with those terms. (laughs) Not even Jimmy Carter could get rid of
                        her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Indeed. In any event, I came back, as I say, in September of '78, as
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services. And, everything in the world
                    started happening. I mean, ahhh...Barbara was about as peripatetic as John
                    Foster Dulles. Or Jim Baker, for that matter. (laughs) And so she was constantly
                    gone, she sometimes took her senior deputy with her, and if she did, I was the
                    next ranking. So I was frequently Acting Secretary. I was acting Assistant
                    Secretary, including when Jonestown occurred. Fortunately Barbara got back very
                    soon after that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, well, it started—as a matter of fact, my phone rang on a Sunday
                    morning, at the crack of dawn. It was well before the crack of dawn. In
                    November, dawn doesn't come very early, and this phone call did. It was about 6,
                    maybe quarter of, from Jim Ward, who was at that time in American Services. He
                    said, “B.J., I hate to bother you, but you're Acting, and some idiot down in
                    Guyana has murdered an American congressman, and there is all hell to pay. I
                    have already set up a task force”, and I said, “oh Jim, thank you, ahhh...mercy
                    to goodness” or words to that effect. “I have house guests, and you know, I
                    have...”</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Mumble, mumble, mumble! Yes! (laughs) So I stumbled around this and he
                    assured me that my services were not needed, but I needed to be informed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when the Secretary called you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, we don't take kindly to murdering our congressmen. Then the
                    suicides followed. Anyway, I let Jim handle everything on Sunday. I mean, he
                    obviously had everything under control. He already had the task force set up, I
                    didn't see any reason for going in and interfering, but nonetheless I was deeply
                    grateful to him, and I've never forgotten it. Then, of course, the following
                    February, as I said awhile ago, the Iranian revolutionaries overran our
                    consulates in Iran and effectively closed them down. And then we had...</p>

                <p>HARPER: Well, Afghanistan wasn't invaded until after we had lost our embassy, and
                    a whole bunch of hostages, in Tehran. So, all together it was a very busy time.
                    Meanwhile, I was also—as I mentioned earlier, the Congress had enacted this
                    commission to replace the Carter task force—and I was the Department's working
                    member of the commission. That is to say, the Secretary was the Commissioner,
                    but obviously somebody had to do the staff work, and I was it as the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary for Visa Services. So I was plodding off to meetings at the
                    Select Commission constantly, I was trying to cope with the Iranians, once that
                    had been delegated down to me, and in general, it was a very busy time. And,
                    meanwhile, my retirement was approaching.</p>

                <p>HARPER: Maybe, I don't know about the assistant secretary. But anyhow, DASs,

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: So, come the month before my birthday, I got this thick sheaf of papers,
                    saying in effect, “Dear Ms. Harper: You know you're retiring from the Foreign
                    Service next month so please fill out all these things in triplicate and return.
                    Barbara said, “B.J., obviously we can't have you leaving at this point; will you
                    stay as a consultant?” Certainly I would stay. I didn't want to retire. I
                    wouldn't have retired voluntarily. There was a big retirement party on the 31st
                    of July and on the first of August I was back at my desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With a different hat...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: A different hat. I no longer had any operational responsibilities with
                    regard to the Visa Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And probably no authority.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: No, I was consultant to the Assistant Secretary, and I was still doing,
                    except for operational things, exactly what I had done before. I was still doing
                    the Select Commission, I was still drafting action memoranda to the Secretary
                    saying you should agree to this proposition and disagree with that one, and
                    defer to the Attorney General on this third one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you couldn't sign visas probably.</hi>

                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>HARPER: I couldn't sign a visa. On the other hand, I was still doing the
                    Iranians; I kept doing the special Iranian cases until 1984.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who followed you in the job from which you retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Bill Maule followed me as Deputy Assistant Secretary. He hadn't planned
                    to, he had come down as my deputy...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Montreal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: From Montreal. He was chief of the consular section in Montreal.
                    Actually, I had brought him to Montreal. In the Spring of 1976, when we were
                    about to move the office and we were about to face the Olympics, the chief of
                    the consular section came wandering in one day and said I have decided to retire
                    effective a month from now. Which sort of left me, you know...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is out of the blue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Oh, you know, real sinking feeling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he wasn't nearing retirement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: It was a she, and she wasn't near retirement. I mean it wasn't mandatory.
                    She just decided that well, it was time to turn in her suit, so to speak, and go
                    home. And so she did. I started thinking about the need for a really
                    crackerjack, top-drawer officer, and it seemed to me that the best officer that
                    I'd ever encountered really, consular officer, was Bill Maule. Moreover, I knew
                    that Bill was in a bad state in the sense that he was in Beirut at the
                    time...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Where there was a war going on. The families had been evacuated. He and
                    Sue were a very close, tight-knit family group with the children, and I knew
                    that he didn't like being separated, I knew that she didn't either, and nobody
                    really likes getting shot at...</p>

                <p>HARPER: Or their apartment blown up. And, particularly if they happened to be in
                    it, but even if they're not. So, I called central personnel and said, “I am in
                    desperate need of the best consular officer I can lay my hands on. How about
                    breaking Bill Maule out of Beirut and direct transferring him here?” And, sure
                    enough, they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He'd been there, though, for two years. And under those

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, as a matter of fact, he had gone back for another two years, and
                    he'd only been in there for one of them. So he really was being direct
                    transferred a year early.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. But after three years then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: He and Sue were very grateful to get out of that situation, and back to a
                    normal family life, you know.</p>
                <p>

                        routinely transferred from Montreal to be your deputy in CA and then moved
                        into your DAS slot upon your retirement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, life takes funny bounces. On the last efficiency report I wrote on
                    Bill—there's a place you may recall on the efficiency reports where you project
                    where you think whositz is going to be in five years, or ten years; how you see
                    his or her future coming—on that last report I had projected that he would
                    become consul general at Montreal or some post similar to it, and deputy
                    assistant secretary of state. And by sheer happenstance he followed me in
                    reverse order, first as deputy assistant secretary, and then some years later as
                    consul general in Montreal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: B. J., as we look back on your very extensive and rich
                        career, much of it associated with immigration matters, the visa function
                        above all, I think we, and perhaps the world, would agree that U.S.
                        immigration laws are far from perfect. The laws have tried to react over the
                        years to those many issues you've raised and discussed. How about, in
                        summary, your telling us whatever you want to about what needs to be
                        changed; how you would alter some of these aspects of present legislation on
                        immigration, including refugee policies, on the general issue of people
                        movement into this country.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>HARPER: Well, I am not prepared, ad lib or otherwise, to provide the congress a
                    blueprint for a new Immigration Act. The problems, as I see it, stem from the
                    lack of a consensus in the United States, among the public in general.
                    Therefore, it does not matter what kind of immigration law we have, it will
                    always be subject to criticism, because the people of the United States don't
                    really know what they want. I mentioned earlier that people tend to have two
                    attitudes towards immigration. I mean, the great general public does. Knowing
                    nothing whatever about how the law reads, let along how it works, there is a
                    conviction in the body politic that we're letting too many people in, but on the
                    other hand, there are some people abroad that they would like to have come here.
                    So there is this bifurcated, conflicted view within the public. I personally
                    believe that we will never settle the question of how many immigrants are too
                    many, until we have settled the question of what should our population policy be
                    in overall terms. How many people can this country afford to have in it, with
                    normal growth, given the finiteness of natural resources, including such things
                    as water.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that's a population question, as well as an economic
                        question?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: So it's a population question as much as it is an economic question;
                    actually, an intertwined problem. You may recall that we have had at least two,
                    I think, select committees on the Hill on population. They went on for years and
                    years, and they never ever came to a conclusion as to what would be the optimum
                    population of the country. So if we can't arrive at some kind of a consensus on
                    how many people would be a realistic maximum, it's not very feasible to design
                    an immigration policy that decides how many new people can come.</p>
                <p>Q; It's almost a question you can't ask, because it presumes our country can't
                    grow anymore, for whatever reasons. And I don't know of any country that really
                    asks that question or focuses on it.</p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, I know. But I mean, this country is so diverse, and has so many
                    interests, which I say are largely competing interests, for every labor union
                    person who wants to protect the jobs of American workers, not just necessarily
                    union workers but all workers, there is an employer who wants to bring in some
                    foreigner to do something in particular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even in this time of so-called recession.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Exactly. Even in this time of recession. So there will always be these
                    competing things, but we have to have something more of a community
                    understanding of the problems regarding immigration. Of what these assorted
                    competing interests are. And I think the sheer absence of general knowledge
                    within the body politic of what these competing interests are that underlie
                    immigration legislation makes it impossible to write legislation that will be
                    generally satisfactory.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What we've written in legislation so far is progressive,
                        if you will, or at least takes cognizance of these contradictions. This then
                        is amazing and perhaps satisfactory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, it's probably as close as we can come in the present circumstances.
                    I think there is one thing that as a technician that I would change, as distinct
                    from as a policy matter. The law is absolutely riddled with internal
                    inconsistencies. For instance, one of the basic tenets of our immigration law
                    has always been first-come, first-served; that is, an applicant's priority date,
                    his or her place on the waiting list, is determined by the date the petition was
                    filed, and visas must be made available in strict chronological order. The
                    ceiling of 20,000 per country...it's now 25,000 plus...makes hash of that
                    provision because there may be thousands of people from high-demand countries
                    who have earlier priority dates than people from low-demand countries but who
                    have to be skipped over because the ceiling for their country has been reached.
                    I don't oppose this; the per-country limit was a deliberate move to prevent any
                    one or two countries from using up all immigration opportunities and I think
                    that's wise. I just point it out as an internal inconsistency. It would be
                    helpful, when they add such provisions...I don't remember whether that was in
                    the 1976 or 1978 amendments but it was not in the '65 Act...if they would amend
                    the basic provision to accord in some fashion with the new provision. But they
                    don't. That's one of the reasons the Immigration Act is considered second only
                    to the Internal Revenue Code in complexity. If we could ever get to a point
                    where we ironed out some of the internal inconsistencies, if we could ever get
                    to the point where the interaction of section this upon section that, and vice
                    versa, was a little clearer in everybody's mind, including that of the Congress,
                    it would be easier to interpret, and we would have fewer lawsuits. It's an
                    extremely litigious area.</p>
                <p>Q; You're referring especially to immigrants? Because we must get into the
                    non-immigrant, too.</p>
                <p>HARPER: Yeah. Well, I'm talking primarily now about the immigration provisions.
                    You're absolutely right. However , the non-immigrant provisions are also a
                    problem for several reasons. First of all, it has to be remembered our
                    immigration laws did not distinguish between immigrants and non-immigrants,
                    until we imposed numerical ceilings, at which point it became necessary. Up to
                    that point, we just took it for granted that if somebody came, they either
                    stayed or they didn't, but who cared.</p>
                <p>Q; We didn't care because the nation was big enough, geographically, to handle
                    it.</p>
                <p>HARPER: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And maybe is now.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>HARPER: Yeah. And, maybe is now. I'm sort of an expansionist type, you know, as
                    far as my personal policy toward immigration is concerned. But, in recent
                    legislation, the Congress has unfortunately tended to blur the distinction
                    between immigrants and non-immigrants in ways that I think are unhelpful and
                    make it harder to administer the law. And it...well, it doesn't necessarily make
                    it difficult to administer the law. If that's what the Congress changes the law
                    to be, well, that's the way you do it. But it does blur, which makes it even
                    more confusing to the layman, and from a philosophical standpoint, I think that
                    is not helpful. Recently there have been some provisions under consideration
                    that would make even more of a mockery of the distinction between immigrants and
                    non-immigrants. There's one bill on the Hill, on which they have held hearings,
                    that would grant a non-immigrant status to the spouses and children of U. S.
                    citizens, for the purpose of coming in and adjusting status, rather than waiting
                    to get an immigrant visa, for heaven's sake. Well, now, mercy to goodness...It
                    doesn't take an Immediate Relative that long to get a visa.</p>

                <p>HARPER: And there is a similar provision, which is even more far-reaching, which
                    would grant the same kind of non-immigrant status to the spouses and children to
                    resident aliens. Now in the cases of the spouses and children of resident
                    aliens, there is a long waiting period for a visa number for those people, so
                    what this provision means that we just ignore the fact that they're not
                    non-immigrants and bring them in to stay here for two or three or however many
                    years, allegedly as non-immigrants, when actually they are immigrants. This
                    offends me intellectually. I think it is intellectually dishonest, as a matter
                    of logic; it offends my sense of logic. I'm all for family unification. I think
                    it would be wonderful to let those spouses and kiddies in. I wouldn't have any
                    objection to making them Immediate Relatives, you know, but as long as the
                    Congress seems to believe that it is necessary to have numerical limits on such
                    immigrants, then I think finding ways to evade the numerical limits, which is
                    what they're suggesting, is not good public policy.</p>

                        together. You reminded me that, of course, some years ago, people just came.
                        And once they got here, for various reasons, it was determined whether they
                        left or didn't leave. And it was relatively easy, so to speak. We have
                        created, I will exaggerate, a monster. In some ways, it's almost an
                        illogical monster, which causes visa officers to climb the wall because
                        right off the bat the officers are given a requirement to determine if an
                        alien deep-down is going to the U.S. with the intention to remain or is us
                        undecided, is “shopping”. Sometimes the truth is in between. And sometimes
                        they're lying, and sometimes they don't even know themselves. Let them all
                        in. Open the door, let everybody come in. The real tourists are tourists,
                        and will leave at the end of their journey. If they're ineligible because
                        they've got AIDS, they'll be refused by INS at the port of entry; but they
                        were for-warned by the notice of forms of ineligibility by the travel

                        Let them in as non-immigrants or immigrants. If they intend to stay and work
                        then the various elements in this country that are the determinants: labor
                        unions, ethnic groups, interested groups, etc. Then if there are numerical
                        limitations imposed by Congress because we have too many people the
                        Immigration Service comes up with, “Well, we're sorry, you can't become a
                        permanent resident now, because we've taken in all the 20,000 numbers
                        allowed for your nationality for this year.” This isn't well articulated,
                        but I thought I'd go to an extreme to try and get us out of this nightmare

                    arrangements and came to the United States and then found that there were no

                <p>HARPER: I think it's impractical from a volume standpoint. But, as I say, I think
                    that if we want to distinguish between immigrants and non-immigrants, then we
                    should do it honestly. You know, we shouldn't be legally cutting corners that
                    make a mockery of the concept. We should either have the concept and enforce it,
                    or we should take your suggestion and disregard it. You know, throw it out the
                    window, and say well in the future...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I make this suggestion largely because we both know how
                        difficult it is sometimes to anticipate an applicant's real motives. And
                        papers mean next to nothing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Oh, yeah. We sure do. And that's the reason, of course, that it would be
                    difficult to adjudicate, re-adjudicate for review, visa refusals in the United
                    States. Because in the non-immigrant case, so much of it relies on the
                    credibility of the individual, and the individual is in front of the consular
                    officer in Timbuckthree (sic), and would not be in front of a Review Board in
                    Washington, D.C. As I said, those are the trends, I mean, that kind of trend
                    worries me, because I think it is unhealthy public policy, I really do. On the
                    other hand, there are those, specifically Senator Simpson, who want to re-write
                    the law, not so much in substance, as editorially. He believes firmly that the
                    law just simply can't be understood because it's written in legalese. I have a
                    terrible problem with that idea, because every word in the Immigration and
                    Nationality Act has, at one time or another, been defined by a court. And the

                    propose to undertake that exercise and I mentioned the absence of a general
                    consensus in the community at large. One of the other things that is interesting
                    about immigration, and the development of immigration policy, is that it has
                    almost never, at least not until quite recently, ever been a partisan matter,
                    that is, party politics. It has been a regional matter. It has been special
                    interests, perhaps, if you want to call it that.</p>

                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>HARPER: Agriculture versus labor recently. The ethnic community's staunch defense
                    of family migration, kind of thing. But it has essentially been a regional
                    matter, and so, if the people in California were stressed by, for instance,
                    Asian immigration earlier on, everybody, Republican and Democrat, it didn't
                    matter, but everybody from California would vote one way. Everybody from New
                    York state would vote one way. And, you know, the people in the great Middle
                    West couldn't have cared less, because not too many immigrants were moving there
                    anyhow. There were pockets, there are large immigrant communities, in Illinois,
                    particularly Chicago, and some in Michigan, and some in some other places, but
                    basically the center of the country has been largely untouched for the last, for
                    most of this century by immigration and so they haven't cared. So it's been a
                    regional issue. I came to believe in the 80s, particularly the early 80s, that
                    there was something of an effort to politicize it in the partisan sense. Senator
                    Simpson, seemed to be considerably more of a political partisan, in his approach
                    to the development of what became the '86 Act, the Simpson Rodino Act, than I'd
                    ever seen before. I found that both surprising and disturbing. I am always so
                    pleased to see any kind of legislation or any kind of political issue which is
                    not a partisan issue, which seems to be determined, really on the basis of the
                    issues, as seen by the constituents of the members. And...</p>

                    have forgotten who was, but way back in, starting as early as 1967, a bill was
                    introduced saying, in effect, “the current immigration law, the '65 Act,
                    discriminates against the Irish because they have been here so long they no
                    longer have any first degree relatives to petition for them and moreover,” (and
                    this just infuriated me, because I'm one quarter Irish), “moreover, they are
                    incapable of meeting the standards for getting a labor certification. Therefore,
                    they can't enter as workers.” Well, now, I didn't think the Irish were all that

                    Irish without saying Irish. Ultimately, when we got to what became the 1986 Act,
                    there were so many provisions in there, which irritated one group or another,
                    and so many other provisions that lots of people were for...</p>
                <p>Q; To remind the reader, this is the law that really focused on people who were
                    here illegally and working illegally. It punished, or whatever the word is, the
                    employer. The Employer Sanction Bill.</p>
                <p>HARPER: That's right. This was the Immigration Reform and Control Act, IRCA, of
                    1986. The bill had gone down to defeat in the House at one point, several years
                    earlier, and then it managed to get enacted by both houses, in separate
                    versions, at an earlier point, when I spent thirty days sitting in the
                    conference, listening to these guys thrashing away fruitlessly. They never did
                    get a conference report out before they adjourned. So now it's 1986, several
                    years down the road, and, you know what I mean, there was a sense of real
                    imperative about getting this bill enacted. And one of the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For what particular reason was there a “real imperative”
                        at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>HARPER: There was a felt need to do something about the illegals. Now there were
                    several felt needs; some groups simply wanted to get rid of the illegals and
                    impose the employer sanctions in order to close down the borders, or at least
                    persuade people not to try to cross the borders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the assumption you couldn't practically close them
                        down, you had to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: If weren't any job prospects, you wouldn't come. You know, you wouldn't
                    try.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Motivation was the reason.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Motivation, yeah. Let's take away the incentive to come. Okay. That was
                    one felt need. Another felt need was to regularize the status of those who were
                    here illegally, because it is unhealthy, in a societal and political sense, to
                    have an underground community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A misused underground community.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Misused by all kinds of employers, and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: There were all sorts of reasons why people felt that it was imperative to
                    get something done. However, something like 102 amendments were submitted to the
                    Rules Committee for House debate. The Rules Committee took one look at this and
                    said, “That's just not possible.” They simply plugged into the legislation about
                    15 or 20 of them, I mean willy-nilly. It didn't matter that the Judiciary
                    Committee hadn't addressed any of them, they just became part of the bill. And
                    the Rules Committee also permitted consideration on the floor of about 15 or 20
                    others. One of the things they adopted was Mr. Donnelley's latest version of the
                    Irish bill which spoke of countries adversely affected by the 1965 Act,
                    primarily meaning Ireland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And someone could prove it was the Irish who were
                        adversely affected, I presume. Or didn't you have to prove it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: We did it on the basis of statistics. If their immigration went down
                    after the 1965 Act, they had been adversely affected. If it went up, they
                    hadn't.</p>
                <p>Q; It's a good definition. I don't know if your sense of logic, whether or...</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>HARPER: Well, it was as close as anyone would come. Turned out to be 36
                    countries, rather than just Ireland.</p>
                <p>Q; Because it became more than Ireland.</p>
                <p>HARPER: Yeah. But, in any event, that's how the Irish provision, that was one of
                    those amendments they just simply plugged into the bill finally became law. It
                    was not debated on the floor. It was a part of the take it or leave it overall
                    legislation, but the managers of the bill felt that it was an amendment that was
                    necessary to have in there in order to get the bill passed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe also a sense of logic, in the sense that there was
                        in it a degree of truth: the mathematics of the '65 law were not fully
                        envisaged. Let's put it that way, that the law would produce changes in the
                        composition of future immigrants.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Ms. Harper: I told you though, a little while ago, I think on about reel one,
                    that we did this study, and gave them estimates that were right on all but one
                    country, and that was Ireland. But your implication was right. It was not
                    acceptable in 1967, in the full flush of enthusiasm for treating all the world
                    alike, but was very acceptable in 1986, in response to the changed pattern of
                    immigration...that is, a predominance of Asian and Latin American immigrants and
                    a drop in those from Europe. Naturally, most, of those 36 countries were in
                    Europe. We still have an Irish provision, you know. I mean, the original
                    Donnelley provision only gave us 5,000 numbers for each of two years. Then that
                    was extended and the numbers went up to 10 or 15,000 a year, and now we have a
                    provision, an interim transition provision, for three years,</p>
                <p>Q; Sounds a bit redundant, but...(laugh)</p>
                <p>HARPER: For 40,000 a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there a demand out there for adjustment of status in
                        the United States or actual pressures, you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, the Irish government is very interested in this...ummm.... of the
                    40,000 per annum for these three years, the Irish get 40%.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the other 35 countries get a share. Explicit
                        share?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Nope. Just 40% go to the Irish.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, the others first come, first served?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Others first come, first served—at least initially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First in line?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, actually, in its initial formulation in the 1990 Act, it was first
                    come, first served, except that you had to get 16,000 Irish out of it. And it
                    operated in strict chronological sequence. In the amendments, technical
                    amendments of 1991, it was changed to a system of random selection by
                    computer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this has nothing to do with the lottery, does it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That is the lottery. More accurately, the random selection one is a
                    lottery. It is my conviction that the first come first served concept is not a
                    lottery. It may be a postal system crap shoot, as Dick would say, but it is not
                    a lottery, because...</p>
                <p>Q; And as he said many times, you do not have to come to the post office outside
                    my office!</p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, first come, first served has been the traditional order of
                    consideration under immigration law. So I don't consider that a lottery, but
                    obviously the random selection one is.</p>
                <p>Q; Now those end this year, this fiscal year?</p>
                <p>HARPER: No, no, last year was the first one, this year will be the second one,
                    next year will be the last one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There will be one more year. One more year, and then it
                        ends. Until the next program comes along that you haven't written yet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, then we have a permanent diversity provision. See, this is a
                    temporary...I don't think they call it temporary, I think they call it a
                    transition diversity program, and then we have a permanent diversity
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then, not to misuse the word lottery, this computer
                        then will determine selection forever? Well, until the law changes
                        again.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>HARPER: Well, the permanent diversity provision involves all sorts of...its sort
                    of an amalgam of where you're from—you have to from a so-called low-volume area—
                    and it includes something of a point...well not exactly a point system, but a
                    group of certain criteria, educational criteria, and skills criteria, etc., in
                    order to participate. But, most of all, you have to be from a country and a
                    region, which is under-represented. That's why it's called a diversity
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You brought us up to date, or as up to date as the moment.
                        Maybe when we go read our newspaper in the morning it will have changed even
                        again. But what you've done is very well summed up the pressures and
                        interests that come to Congress, to the executive branch. In turn, reaction
                        to Congressional decisions and the input that the executive branch might
                        give. Do you think that this present compromise, and that's a bad word, will
                        now go for a while? Is this the way to walk down this path of contrary,
                        conflicting interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I don't know. Ummm...There are several bills under consideration by the
                    House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, this spring. There have been
                    several hearings recently. Whether or not any of these ideas will be
                    enacted...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, are they the fundamental issues you've laid
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, as I say, a couple of them involve these non-immigrant spouses, who
                    are not non-immigrants, kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's relatively small though, now isn't it? It

                </p>
                <p>HARPER: It's certainly substantive. But, in general, I would say that the feeling
                    is anti “immigration legislation” at the moment. Jack Brooks is the current
                    chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the House. When the '90 bill was on the
                    floor, Mr. Brooks made it eminently clear that that was the last immigration
                    legislation that he wanted to see while he was Chairman of the full Committee.
                    And, he was, I mean, he was quite explicit about it!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He tends to be...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: “By all means enact this legislation so that I can put it behind me.”
                    And, he feels or felt so strongly about the subject that he changed the name of
                    the subcommittee. It used to be the Subcommittee on Immigration, Nationality,
                    Refugees, and International Law as I recall. He promptly changed the title to
                    the Subcommittee on International Law, Refugees and then down toward the end,
                    Immigration and Nationality.</p>

                <p>HARPER: The words are all there, it's just that you reverse the thrust, because
                    he didn't want all that emphasis on immigration.</p>

                <p>HARPER: Yes, he did manage to get through the miscellaneous and technical
                    amendments a year later, despite Brooks' earlier comments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of those had satisfied some of your—whatever you want
                        to call them—more logical, less contradictory issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yeah. Some did. Some did. There were some real technical holes in the '90
                    Act, simply because they got in such a hurry, towards the end of the session,
                    and accidents happen, you know. Lots of them, as a matter of fact. As a favor to
                    one of the staffers on the Legislative Council who was working on a new
                    Committee Print of the INA, I went through every cotton-picking word of the new
                    law, versus the old law—that is, the old law as amended by the new law, compared
                    with the law in effect the day before enactment, to make sure that there were no
                    glitches, and notating where there were. We spent at least 8 hours on the phone
                    afterwards, just my enumerating where all the glitches were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then they would re-write it, or it would...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: And the technical amendments took care of most of those. There were also
                    some substantive amendments in there. Regrettably, one of the amendments that I
                    had proposed was not adopted because a member of the Immigration Lawyers
                    Association managed to get to some member of the committee, and persuaded him
                    that it was a crummy idea; just one single attorney, you know, who just went to
                    one single member, and the next thing you know, my proposed amendment
                    disappeared.</p>

                        to be, for all the reasons you cited. Immigration policy formulation is a
                        complex series of often contradictory, conflicting interests. And that's in

                    regretted that she talked me out of it, but, of course, on the other hand, while
                    I was not going to night school was when I was writing that confounded book
                    “between two in the morning,” so to speak. You know, as I look back on it, I
                    cannot believe that I ever wrote an 800 page book on a typewriter when, if you
                    made a mistake or you decided that this paragraph ought to go up or down a
                    couple of paragraphs, you didn't just push a button and move it. You started
                    with a fresh piece of paper and did it over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: B.J., our personal work history goes back to those
                        colleagues who even were working with “plumed pens”, so to speak, because
                        they felt more secure with older methods, rather than a typewriter! You and
                        I have gone from typewriters to computers!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, there are times when the computer goes down, and I think fondly of
                    those plumes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. And you can't find a plume, nor even a
                        typewriter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: B.J., you have explained in detail why you have not yet
                        set out to write a new or changed law...very logically! Do you have any
                        other words for our readers as you end our, I think, very productive and
                        very enlightening insight into the realities of immigration to this
                        country?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>HARPER: I don't know that I can add much, if anything, to what I've already said.
                    I have found, that is, I find law fascinating, both in the citizenship field and
                    in the immigration field. Nonetheless, I think I do understand, having been an
                    officer in the field, I do understand the frustrations of the people out in the
                    field, who get the sense that they're just spinning wheels, that any klutz can
                    do what they're doing, and that really their minds are not being fully utilized.
                    I understand it, but I don't agree with it. I don't share it, at all. I think it
                    is critically important to understand the purposes of the immigration law, why
                    it is in the interest of this country to admit some people, and not admit
                    others. Why it is in the interest of the country, or at least as now understood,
                    is believed to be by the policy makers in the interest of the country, to have X
                    number, rather than Y number, and to take seriously, and always have sort of at
                    the front of one's mind, what all those grounds of ineligibility are, and why we
                    have them, and whether or not they are applicable to John Doe, who is standing
                    at your window, or seated at your desk as the case may be. These are not
                    “routine” functions or uninteresting, if done with the right attitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And maybe to live with contradictions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: I think it can be very intellectually challenging to do the job well. And
                    I think that, because there is a great deal of sameness, there is a tendency to
                    get careless, and not do the job well, and not give it the thought that it
                    should be given. But I think that if one does give it the thought that it should
                    be given, it can be a very challenging kind of assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As indeed in foreign affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Yes, and as I said earlier, I can think of nothing more directly a matter
                    of international relations than the transfer of people across international
                    borders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: B.J., could I thank you very much on behalf of the
                        readers, and maybe some of those junior officers out there who will read
                        this. We have to stop history every so often and look back. You've done a
                        beautiful job and thank you very much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, thank you, I'm flattered to have been asked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARPER: Well, I really am.</p>
