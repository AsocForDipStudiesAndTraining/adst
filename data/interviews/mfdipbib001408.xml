                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is 1st of October 1998. The interview is with
                        Ambassador Donald McHenry. Don, the place where there was a break, something
                        was wrong with the tape, you said, “I took a fellowship with the Council of
                        Foreign Relations and a guest scholarship and the Brookings Institute.” This
                        is 1971. You were there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: Until late '73 and then I went to the Carnegie Endowment for
                    International Peace, where I stayed from '73 until late 1976 at which time I
                    left and went to work on the Carter Transition Team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were with first with the Brookings Institution,
                        '71-'73, what were you working on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>McHENRY: I did some research on South Africa. This was a period of time when
                    there was a great deal of awakening in the U.S. in terms of the role of
                    corporations in the apartheid regime in South Africa. We had the so called
                    “Polaroid” experiment which came along I think in the early 1971. In essence it
                    was pressure from churches and universities to have American corporations with
                    investments in South Africa hew to a standard which was befitting American
                    corporations. I went of to Brookings and one of the things which I tackled was
                    the question of the operations of American owned corporations in South Africa. I
                    spent a great deal of time, I made two trips to South Africa during that period
                    of time, and spent a lot of time both in the U.S. and in South Africa looking at
                    corporations. I did everything from tramp through bathrooms and look at the
                    bathroom facilities and cafeterias and talk to people about their housing and
                    job promotion treatment and so forth. It was an interesting period. Rather
                    fascinating discovery stories during that period. This is also the period, as I
                    said, that we had the “Polaroid” experiment, where Polaroid announced that it
                    would not allow distribution of its film through its distributor in South Africa
                    unless they met certain standards. They took a very high profile position on
                    that. That whole movement evolved into the so-called Sullivan Principles. Which
                    eventually evolved even further to the point where American legislation set
                    standards for American corporations in South Africa. One of the interesting
                    things about what came out of that experience was that when I did go back to the
                    State Department in 1977, one of the first things that I worked on was the
                    effort of Secretary Vance to pull together American corporations and get them to
                    sign on to the Sullivan Principles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't there two sort of separate streams of approach and
                        quite a lot of argument between them? One of them was that America should
                        set example, American corporations, and they try to encourage other ones to
                        do this promotion of native Africans and treat them equally and move them up
                        the ladder in fair competition. And the other one was “screw you all and get
                        out.” What did you think on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>McHENRY: There were those two things. One was “look at the standards of
                    operation”, and the other was “get out”. My feeling all along was that even if
                    eventually one campaigned to have people dis-invest and also had an interest in
                    how they conducted themselves while they were there, it was clear to me that
                    they weren't about to get out under the then circumstances and that the
                    corporations would not withdraw until there have been significant changes in
                    South Africa, which in essence put additional pressure on them to withdraw. And
                    I think one saw that over a period of time. Unfortunately I think many of the
                    advocates of dis-investment tended to listen to their rhetoric more than observe
                    the facts. Case in point is that long before American corporations finally
                    started pulling out of South Africa, the big banks concluded that this is not a
                    normal risk, so instead of large loans on very good terms and over a longer
                    period of time, banks started making modest loans to South Africa, higher rates,
                    and over a short period of time. The result was that by the time the South
                    African situation had deteriorated further and Chase Manhattan decided it wasn't
                    worth the risk, they didn't have to go very far, in terms of really jerking the
                    chain of the South Africans. They simply cut off even the short term loans and
                    of course result on the South African government at that stage was enormous. But
                    I think most of the advocates of dis-investment who continue to criticize the
                    banks missed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is easy to get caught up in your own ideology and have
                        a simplistic way of treating a problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: I didn't mean to suggest that they shouldn't be advocating
                    dis-investment. Because my own view, which I expressed and wrote about, was that
                    without the pressure for dis-investment we would not have gotten adherence to
                    standards of operations while they were there. The dis-investment push was
                    useful both economically and politically in terms of change in South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this early '70s period, while you were studying
                        this, I remember I was in INR back in the '60s, dealing with Horn of Africa,
                        but I listened to my colleagues who were dealing with South Africa. And the
                        conventional wisdom was, “Well, South Africa obviously is not going to
                        continue the way it is, and there will be a night of long knives.” In a way
                        as it happened in Algeria with the French. But when you were looking at this
                        closely, did you see this as a scenario?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>McHENRY: No, I didn't. I think one of the things that one had to constantly be
                    amazed with was the strength and the maybe ruthlessness of the South African
                    government on the one hand. But on the other hand, the enormous patience which
                    was demonstrated by the black community in South Africa. I am constantly
                    reminded of that section in the book Cry the Beloved Country, by Alan Paton,
                    where there is that dialogue where the old man says that he is concerned that by
                    the time the whites learn to love, blacks will have learned to hate. Well, we
                    didn't get that far in South Africa. The perfect example of that is Mandela, who
                    comes out of prison after 27 years, the best years of his life, and speaks
                    kindly of his jailor. All of them did not have that experience, but there was a
                    remarkable sense of tolerance, even among those who were pressing very hard for
                    change. The ANC, as you will recall, had all these debate about the extent to
                    which violence should be used. Whether violence could only go against physical
                    objects, and you had to make sure that no one was present who might be injured.
                    Over to the point where physical objects, hope that nobody is there, but if they
                    are, too bad. They really never got to the point where there was a wide-spread
                    belief in terrorism. Car bombs and that kind of thing. It did not occur.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that your experience when you came back, did
                        you find within the academic and government community, was your thinking
                        parallel with most of the people or were they quite divergent ways?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: When I was at Brookings at the Council of Foreign Relations, period “71
                    to '73, I was still technically at the State Department, I was on leave. I had
                    great deal of contact with the Department during that time. And I would say that
                    the fact that I was on leave facilitated some of the access which I had when I
                    went to South Africa. I went as a private citizen but the South Africans were
                    well aware that I was on leave, and government agencies and corporations were
                    well aware. So I got a level of cooperation that I might not have gotten
                    otherwise. It also meant that I kept up with the thinking that was going on in
                    the Department and within the U.S. government at that time. I would say that at
                    the period when the policy of the government, '71 to late '76, I think that the
                    policy of the U.S. government was neither to encourage nor discourage investment
                    in South Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>The difference between my own views and those of the government was that I took
                    the position that there should be no new investment in South Africa. I tried to
                    recognize that those who were already there went in under different times,
                    different values, different sensitivity. And when they went in I wouldn't say
                    that what they were doing was perfectly respectable, but there was no raw
                    feeling in the U.S. against it. And in a sense they were now there and the world
                    had changed, politically, economically, its values, and so forth. So, I felt
                    quite strongly that you could not suddenly apply today's standards to what went
                    on yesterday. At the same time, it seemed to me that two things were in
                    operation. That business was for the most part going to exercise some risk of
                    judgment. They don't get enough credit for that, and that they would be very
                    careful about extending their operations into South Africa, or enlarging their
                    operations. And I didn't see them doing either one of those on a significant
                    scale. Except in some narrowly defined industries.</p>
                <p>Secondly, as a practical matter, they would pay a large penalty to pull out,
                    because South Africans had restrictions on repatriation of profits, investment,
                    and it did not seem to me during that period of time that as a practical matter
                    dis-investment was going to take place. And I think those observations were
                    proved to be correct. There wasn't a hell of a lot of new investment in South
                    Africa. There was a lot of reinvestment of funds which they wouldn't have been
                    able to get out anyway. Secondly, as I said, the banks put restrictions on. They
                    didn't shout about them, but any South African investor knew that they were
                    there.</p>
                <p>And third, it seemed to me that while you criticize them in terms of new
                    investment, and there was this group outside which wanted dis-investment, it
                    seemed to me to be advantageous to push the establishment of standards and to
                    push those standards as far as you could. And, as you know, by the time the
                    “Polaroid” experiment came to its not end, but it sort of petered as Polaroid
                    pulled out, or wouldn't allow its distributor to work any longer, the Sullivan
                    Principles went so far, having participated in that meeting I can tell you that
                    it was very difficult to get people to sign on them initially. And Sullivan had
                    to compromise in terms of those first principles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What meeting was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: This was the one I referred to which was held in the State Department
                    where they got company officials together to persuade them to sign on to the
                    Sullivan Principles. Eventually those Principles were strengthened over time,
                    they were institutionalized, professional staff oversaw the application of them,
                    and of course by the late 1980s Congress itself passed the anti-apartheid Act.
                    That even more institutionalized and made in the U.S. law factors on
                    investment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, this was during the Nixon period, really
                        towards the end of it, how did you find the approach and work of the
                        Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>McHENRY: The Embassy went through a series of changes. I think in 1971 we had
                    John Hurd there, who as a cattleman, and had done well by the Republican party.
                    I got along with him. I was there as a private citizen when I went into the
                    Embassy. They had some problems in the late '60s and '70s. The Ambassador was
                    criticized for going hunting on Robben Island and using political prisoners to
                    retrieve his catch. He had been accused of socializing with one of the most
                    horrible of South African ministers. There were some problems. On the other
                    hand, they did some useful and interesting things. They kept up a certain amount
                    of pressure. The South Africans knew clearly that they were being pressured.
                    They weren't nearly as pressured as they had been under the Johnson
                    administration because the Nixon administration immediately relaxed some of the
                    arms embargo for example. Whereas under Johnson if it was a dual purpose you
                    didn't sell it. If there was any doubt about it, you didn't sell it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what we mean by “dual purpose”.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: Something which can be used for by civilian and military use. A jeep
                    could be a dual purpose item, a light aircraft could be a dual purpose item,
                    Cessna could be a dual purpose item. For us a Cessna plane is something people
                    jockey around in on weekends. But in the terrain of South Africa, when they are
                    doing border control, light aircraft is very useful, for military purposes.
                    Johnson wouldn't sell them, Nixon of course would. And so to that extent in that
                    period, '69 to'74 it was a very definite loosening in light of that
                    administration.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: I resigned from the Department in 1973 and went to the Carnegie
                    Endowment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What the resignation a carrier choice or because of
                        political reasons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: One of the reasons for going on leave in '71 was political frankly. I
                    didn't like what was going on in Southeast Asia, I didn't like the Parrot's Beak
                    invasion and various things. I didn't like the effort to ram through the Supreme
                    Court those two chaps who were nominated for Supreme Court. I didn't like the
                    way they were treating the Secretary of State and I was working with the
                    Secretary of State '69-'71. I just had it by '71. What I tried to do was to go
                    on to retain the presence but to go on leave, to put some distance between me
                    and that group.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>On Southeast Asia I'd had just a constant philosophical problem, when all those
                    demonstrations took place, people marching around Washington. Every time I had a
                    house-full of young people who would come to Washington and I would volunteer
                    for them to stay. I had 25-30 people staying in my house, marching. They were
                    all surprised when late in the evening we'd sit around and they'd discover that
                    I was in the State Department. Part of the enemy as far as they were concerned.
                    It was good that they discovered that the enemy wasn't what they thought the
                    enemy was. But it was a difficult time. So I went on leave. Then in '73 I
                    resigned. To be quite candid, I might not have resigned in '73 if the kind of
                    job that was available to me had been better. I was offered a Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary position for Africa, and it was pulled back. Not because I didn't have
                    qualifications, it was for age. I wasn't old enough they thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were you then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: 35. Now you have Assistant Secretaries who are 31 years of age! The
                    feeling was that there were so many other people around who were much older. And
                    the Department you have to remember was more top heavy. They simply weren't
                    about to do it and I wasn't that inclined to go back anyway, and when that
                    didn't come through I left.</p>
                <p>And then you went to Carnegie Endowment. It was a good time to be there. Tom
                    Hughes was there as a head. Hughes had been in INR at State, had been a DCM in
                    London and he'd just gone to the Endowment, and he was pulling in very young,
                    sort of aggressive staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Carnegie Endowment at that time, what did it represent
                        as far as, you know, it's an endowment for world peace, but essentially what
                        role did it play?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: Hughes was changing the role. The Endowment has gone through any number
                    of roles over the years. I would say that it probably isn't doing today what
                    Carnegie may have envisioned it doing. But Tom was in process of making it more
                    policy oriented as opposed to research oriented. Research with policy. As
                    opposed to research-academic, as opposed to research-reference. And he wanted
                    more participation in policy dialogue. Whether it was conferences, publications,
                    or Op-Ed pieces, it didn't matter, he wanted more of that. He was also trying to
                    pull it further away from its identification solely with international
                    organizations and law, where it was oriented from the beginning. I think he
                    ended up pulling it too far away so that the organization which was identified
                    with those institutions, with those aspects of foreign affairs, disappeared and
                    we paid a price for that.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>But in any event, Tom gathered around a lot of people from State, David Biltchik,
                    Tony Lake, Dick Holbrooke, and the good thing about working with Tom was that he
                    got his bright young folks around him, you persuaded him what aspect of policy
                    you wanted to look at and he'd let you do your own thing; he didn't interfere.
                    He was indeed a cheerleader. I worked in a section which we called Humanitarian
                    Policy Studies. We were looking at sort of the human side, the soft side of
                    policy problems. And we did everything from looking at the situation in
                    Zimbabwe, Tony Lake did a study which was called “The tar may be option”, much
                    more serious than in sounds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is from Joel Chandler's The Cry of Brer Rabbit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: What he was actually doing was looking at the policy choices that Nixon
                    and Kissinger had made in the late 1960s with regard to southern Africa.
                    Basically he said that once you started down that road there was no going away
                    from it. Because you put your hand on one side and the other hand on the other
                    side, and you were stuck. And you put your foot there to kick it away, and that
                    foot was stuck too. Roger Morris worked on the Burundi situation and one of the
                    perennial ethnic conflicts there and the role of American commercial enterprises
                    in U.S. foreign policy in Burundi. I lead a study initially on Micronesia. The
                    role of the U.S. in determining Micronesia's political and social future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before we reached the Compact Program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: This was before the Compact, and one of the issues which we addressed
                    was whether there ought to be a Compact. The study came out with very strong
                    reservations about the approach which the U.S. was taking. Reservations, which I
                    might add, have been borne by the facts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a sad situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>McHENRY: It's a very sad situation. I can't guarantee it would have gone
                    differently had they followed the approach which we outlined, but some of the
                    things that we warned against in the considerations which the U.S. were using,
                    turned out to be correct. We warned against the heavy emphasis on the future
                    military use of the area, and allowing the military's desire to have tenement in
                    the Marshals and the area in Palau; that was sort of tail wagging the policy and
                    we felt that it was incorrect thing to do. We also warned against allowing
                    portions of Micronesia which were well off by virtue of their military
                    attractiveness to go their own way leaving the less well off areas to suffer.
                    There were economic and cultural and social advantages of trying to encourage
                    some kind of political arrangement which kept them going. You simply can't have
                    seven first rate hospitals for a 100,000 people. You can't do it. Or seven first
                    rate institutions of higher education for a 100,000 people. It can't be done.
                    Well, they didn't do that, they went on their way and we have a fragmented
                    situation out there which has in fact been embarrassing to the U.S. The labor
                    practices in the Marianas, for example, have been very, very embarrassing to the
                    U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went and spent a week there. It's poor and impoverished,
                        living off the dole essentially.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: It's one of the poorer places whereas the Marianas and the Marshals came
                    off better and Palau came off better because they had something the military
                    wanted. But in any event, we did that. Later on, that is where the book
                    Micronesia, Trust Betrayed was developed. I did a study on terrorism, and
                    specifically with question of how you get hostages back. Do you follow what was
                    in the Kissinger theory that we're not going to negotiate, we're not going to
                    have anything to do with you, or do you try to find some pragmatic way of
                    getting hostages back. The interesting part of that period was that we used
                    young people in that research process. We had a very large paid internship
                    program and every year we had a contest, if you will. We selected interns form
                    all over the country and we brought them to Washington to work at the Endowment
                    for 6 to 12 months, under Tony Lake or me or Roger Morris or a number of others,
                    Martin Carpenter who later went back to State Department. Those young people
                    were able to look at the research in a very different way. It was not just
                    detached academic research. They went into the departments, they talked to the
                    organizations, they went to the Hill and they delved into and then gave some
                    life, some meaning to things which might have otherwise been very
                    unattractive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, one of the things you mentioned the people who
                        were there and it sounds like Carnegie Institute at that period represented
                        you might say the democratic, I won't call it left, shadow government or
                        something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: There were a number of articles that were written along those lines,
                    talking about the rise of Carnegie Endowment and how it was giving Brookings and
                    a number of other institutions a run for their money.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because Brookings before had been considered...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: And we were different. Because we were publishing and we did pay some
                    attention to the impact of what we wrote and what we researched. We didn't
                    simply write for somebody's bookshelf. It was a very different time and of
                    course everybody who was there went on to do other things. In fact on the
                    Transition Team alone for the new State Department, I went on with the
                    Transition Team, Tony Lake was there. By this time Roger Morris had moved
                    further, further, further left, and was writing zingers against some of us by
                    the way, but it was an interesting time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, you speak about books ending up on bookshelves.
                        Particularly in the field of contemporary political science, when I do these
                        interviews I see people and their book shelves are lined with books that
                        have come out and you could almost tell by their titles when they were
                        written. Did you find that the writing and the research had an impact
                        anywhere? How did this translate into policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: It's always difficult to be precise in terms of policy. But when the
                    Compact for example was being debated on the Hill they held up the Compact. And
                    they had a theory in which the book and the findings were gone over pretty
                    thoroughly. The strength of the Pentagon and the Micronesian lobbyists was
                    enormous during that period of time and everyone went on their merry way. But
                    the same thing is true with Roger Morrison's work on Burundi. I think that had
                    something of an impact. “The Tar Baby” option which Tony Lake did, was more of a
                    look back, but it also was important in exposing the kind of thinking which had
                    gone into the policy of the Nixon administration on South Africa. And that kind
                    of thinking the U.S. had started moving away from over the next ten years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '76 you got involved in Carter campaign. Was
                        this...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: It was a strange kind of relationship. I was asked to serve on the
                    Advisory Committee for Carter. This was a group that was put together ostensibly
                    to educate him on foreign policy to bring together papers that he might use on
                    foreign policy or to answer his questions. The committee didn't meet that much.
                    You always wonder how useful these things are. I started on that from about
                    September of '76 until the election. Before that period, the summer of '76, I
                    was away, I had a European Union fellowship and I spent the summer of '76 on
                    that fellowship. Dick Holbrooke and I were together in the same group and I
                    spent my time looking at the role of guest-workers in Europe and traveled to
                    Italy and Germany and Netherlands and the UK and so forth, with the guest-worker
                    program problem.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were on this advisory group when Carter was
                        sitting in did you find that there was a significant focus on Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: One session was held on Africa and I was not there. I was off on the
                    European Community fellowship, but he did hold a session about Africa. The
                    Advisory Group was broader, was addressed to the whole realm of foreign policy,
                    and then he and they set up some individual sessions on the Middle East and
                    Africa and so forth on military policy. I did not participate in the one on
                    Africa, it was held in airplanes. I was in Germany or some place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling as the election was approaching about
                        Carter taking foreign affairs, was there enthusiasm, sort of “Anything but
                        the previous administration”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: I don't think there was “Anything but the previous administration”, but
                    this is a period of time in which there was a concern, pretty broadly held, that
                    we had a foreign policy that was without values. Particularly on the human
                    rights side. We'd gone to far emphasizing the strategic issues, the communist
                    threat, that kind of thing. It wasn't that people weren't concerned about
                    strategic issues and communist threat. But there was a concern that in Pakistan
                    or in our relations with the Shah we weren't thinking enough about the Kurds,
                    that we were too cold when it came to the southern Africa, that there was a
                    whole strain of dictators that we were too close to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that as the campaign moved on, that Carter
                        would be a different creature in the political, international sphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: I felt that way, or maybe I hoped. But there were reasons to believe
                    that. His speeches tended to inject a human rights element. And certainly the
                    human rights community rallied around him. Now, that ended up being good and
                    bad. Because, when you get people, advocates of the cause, involved in any
                    campaign they sometimes want to move so swiftly that you have not yet
                    established your policies to implement the new approaches. That was true with
                    Clinton on the gay issue. People were pushing him on gays before he had even
                    gotten into the Pentagon. Before they'd been able to articulate a framework in
                    which they were going to operate. It was true with Carter on human rights.
                    Before Carter's people, before the Secretary of State had a chance to say how
                    we're going to get from here to there, there were those both inside and outside
                    the administration who were already there. That's a formula for disaster.</p>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>McHENRY: Korea was a perfect example. You might adopt the overall goal, but there
                    is a long way between adopting it and getting it. Korea was an excellent example
                    of where the administration got into trouble. But it wasn't the only one. There
                    were other examples. By the time they sort of rushed to put out a more
                    thoughtful speech on foreign policy, on human rights, it was late in the game.
                    Even though it was early in the game, it was already late.</p>

                        administration coming in. They get caught up in their own rhetoric and have
                        true believers, and then you are up against the practicalities of governance
                        which is quite different matter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: One of the problems is that people you need to help you get elected are
                    not the people you need or can afford to help you govern. That is the real
                    problem.</p>

                        the people who caused the revolution, even if they won. With a guillotine or
                        some other way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: Hopefully, you don't have to go that far. But it is a real problem. And
                    you had the example early in administration a young chap, not so young, by the
                    name of Brady Tyson, who had been a professor at American University and close
                    to Andy Young. He was put on the American delegation to the Human Rights
                    Commission. He didn't know anything about how the government operates. So, Brady
                    Tyson goes off to Geneva and he makes a speech in which he apologizes for the
                    policies of the U.S. government in Vietnam. Now, there are reasons for
                    criticizing the U.S. government and there may even be an occasion or
                    circumstance when one wants to apologize. But that is a thoughtful decision and
                    it is not made by Brady Tysons of this world. The result was just an absolute
                    horrible circumstance. Very strong criticism of the administration early on as
                    being undisciplined and having people going out doing their own thing.</p>

                <p>McHENRY: When I went on the Transition Team, right after the election early in
                    November, Cyrus Vance who had been designated Secretary of State pulled around
                    him a group. Tony Lake was I think the person who was the first one there, and I
                    was there and Dick Moose, and Dick Holbrooke and a whole group of others. We had
                    the responsibility of not only trying to help on the personnel questions, to
                    staff the new administration and foreign and defense affairs, but we had all
                    kinds of policy questions that one needed to try and get a grip on for the
                    beginning of the administration. What do you have to do when you walk in the
                    door, that first week or the first two weeks. And before it we had to do
                    staffing. We divided up the foreign affairs and defense community on the basis
                    of some expertise. Bill Maines who was also in that group was in charge sort of
                    the UN system, and the Bureau of International Organization Affairs and a number
                    of others. I had responsibility for USIA and Latin America. I had AID as well. I
                    spent a lot of time working with the various outgoing heads and those various
                    bureaus and organizations, trying to get some accurate knowledge of immediate
                    policy decisions, trying to find out who the good people were, trying to look at
                    the whole question of organization. Do you want this structure? Beginning of
                    administration is a good time to make organizational changes. We did that until
                    the end of January. Very long hours, extraordinary long hours and time put
                    in.</p>
                <p>It was my second transition. I served on the transition team from Johnson to
                    Nixon. I had served on that transition team while I was in the State Department
                    quite by accident. Because Johnson had appointed Bill Rogers, who was then a
                    private citizen, had been Attorney General in the Eisenhower administration,
                    close to Nixon, Johnson had appointed Rogers to serve on a delegation to the UN.
                    And I had been detailed on the State Department to serve on that staff. So, when
                    Nixon is elected, sets up the transition team, selects Rogers as his Secretary
                    of State designate, Rogers naturally reaches out for people he knows in the
                    Department. I was one of those and I was pulled away to serve on that transition
                    team. So, ironically I was on two transition teams, the one from Johnson to
                    Nixon and one from Ford to Carter.</p>

                        often sets the attitudes. Can you do a little compare-and-contrast, sort of,
                        the approach or attitude of Nixon to the Carter one?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>McHENRY: Yes. Let me just take foreign affairs. Because that's the one I know.
                    Transition to Nixon. Nixon in the first place operated out of the Hotel Pierre
                    in New York and he had a number of people up there around him. There was
                    immediately tension between the State Department people who were on that
                    transition team and Nixon and what was to be the White House staff. Nixon took
                    the advantage of the time to restructure the Foreign Affairs Bureau.
                    Nixon/Kissinger, as Kissinger was up there with Nixon. They came up with a whole
                    series of re- structure for Foreign Affairs. Which when we saw it in Washington
                    sitting there with Rogers, we said, “This is a formula for disaster.” That in
                    essence the White House is taking over Foreign Affairs and leaving State with
                    day-to-day administration. Rogers felt that even if this was true, it didn't
                    matter. That he was a personal friend of the president and when it came to the
                    real issues, he would be taking it up with the president. But, from the very
                    beginning, having seen that, everyone in State recoiled against it. It wasn't
                    just AID. The Pentagon had a problem with it too. And you got immediately that
                    we-they approach. Now, in the Carter administration, there were some things
                    which started off looking as if they were going to be we-they. And I don't know
                    what Brzezinski was saying to his transition group, but I know what Vance was
                    saying to his. Vance said to us, when we saw something we didn't like, he said,
                    “Look, we are not going to have this we-they approach. I do not want you guys
                    knocking them and I do not want them knocking us. You guys work with it. If you
                    have a difference, sit down and work it out. That was Vance's approach. I must
                    say that I think Vance kept his part of that bargain, but in my view, Brzezinski
                    did not. You see it come out clearly in Brzezinski book, you see it come out
                    clearly in Carter's book, and certainly those of us who were watching it on a
                    day-to-day basis felt very strongly that it was not working as Vance would have
                    wanted it. And as you know it was significant in Vance's resignation. Because it
                    was the White House “do something” crowd, which not only overrode Vance but made
                    a decision when he wasn't present.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you have something like this, if you're playing by
                        the gentlemen's rules and the other side has its own agenda, the gentlemen
                        usually lose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: I regret to say, I think that's true. It's easy to do in the State
                    Department and vis-a-vis the White House. Power rests over there in the White
                    House. The President ends up with a foreign policy structure, the foreign policy
                    that he wants or that he gets by default by his own lack of interest in it.
                    Secondly, you can sit there with a very small staff in the White House and the
                    NSC, and you have freedoms which a Secretary of State will never have. You will
                    never have to see every Tom, Dick and Harry who arrives wanting to see the
                    Secretary of State. You don't have to go off to all of these meetings around the
                    world. You can be very, very selective. You are not swamped with the day to day
                    bureaucratic structure on the Hill and all the things that go with it. As
                    Secretary of State you start off, I think, at a distinct disadvantage to someone
                    sitting in NSC seat who really wants to be the Secretary of State.</p>

                        the feeling, that Brzezinski watched what Kissinger did and was going to
                        copy and do it better.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: There are those who say that he spent his life trying to compete with
                    Kissinger. I won't comment on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find in this Transition Team as so often happens,
                        we talked about this before. The people who help to win the campaign, the
                        ideologues, particularly I would say in human rights, and getting troops out
                        of Korea and all this, were they present or was this a more professional
                        group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: I think Carter made the same mistakes that Clinton has made later, that
                    Nixon made earlier. I think the nature of the American political process
                    requires increasingly a group of people who get involved in the campaign at a
                    very early stage, sometimes four years early. When the election is over there is
                    a feeling that you owe them something. The tendency is to get them involved in
                    the new administration, frequently in the wrong jobs, and you pay a price for
                    putting in the position of responsibility people who simply shouldn't be there.
                    They had a role, their role was to help you get elected. Their role is not
                    necessarily helping you govern. You see this with Ham Jordan in the Carter
                    Administration, you saw it in the administration of Ronald Reagan where he
                    eventually had to bring in people to run his various aspects of the government,
                    the White House. His first National Security Advisor didn't last very long. He'd
                    been involved in the campaign, but he didn't last very long. And you also see it
                    now with Clinton, who's had to go through many changes in order to get the kind
                    of people around him that he needs. It's very unfortunate and people don't learn
                    that lesson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the Carter Administration came in dealing with the
                        transition in the State Department, did you see any areas that concerned
                        you? I mean, people coming in who were...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>McHENRY: Let me just take the area which I know best of all, which is the UN. I
                    was asked to go to the U.S. Mission as the Number Three person. There still are
                    people, and if you get this on-line information about people in the news, you'll
                    find that these inaccurate stories are still there. There are people who believe
                    that I went to U.S.-UN because I had been a long time friend of Andy Young, or
                    because I had been active in the civil rights situation in the South. I did not
                    know Andy Young, I had not been active in the human rights movement. I had
                    consciously decided that I was going to be involved and concentrate on foreign
                    affairs. But I was persuaded to take that job. It was Vance's effort to try and
                    persuade Andy Young that he really needed to surround himself with people with
                    some professionalism, some specialized knowledge. So Vance persuaded Andy to
                    take Jim Leonard, who had been in the diplomatic circles who had retired,
                    brought him back as Number Two, I was brought in as Number Three. Melissa Wells
                    was brought in as the person in charge of economic and social affairs, and then
                    there was Al Lowenstein, former Congressman, who was there. If you look at it,
                    we had three of the five people who had very long, deep background in foreign
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Leonard, you and Wells.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: Andy had none, and Lowenstein even though he'd been active in all kinds
                    of causes had no background in foreign affairs and had no discipline of
                    bureaucracy. There were others who they brought in. I mentioned Brady Tyson.
                    Brady was only one of several who came in because they'd known Andy, or they'd
                    known Al Lowenstein, or they'd been active in the campaign, or they'd been
                    active in some kind of process, and now were there in the U.S. mission to the
                    UN, or some place in the UN system. It was clearly a mistake. Or if they were to
                    be brought in, they should have been reined in early. Most of those people
                    eventually left, left quite early, because of putting their foot in their mouth,
                    or because they became disenchanted about the difficulty of translating the
                    ideas into policy, of getting from here to there. But it's a problem. It really
                    is. And I suspect that you find the same thing in any number of places in the
                    administration. You had it in the Reagan Administration, the same way. The
                    Bureau of Latin American Affairs was simply wiped out and they brought in
                    ideologues after ideologues.</p>

                <p>McHENRY: Absolutely. Including the mistreatment of one of our most distinguished
                    carrier diplomats, Bill Bowdler. Who was simply told by Reagan's people to clear
                    out his desk in 24 hours. In his place, in the place of that Bureau of
                    experience, they put in ideologues.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>McHENRY: To '81. I was there the first two years in the role as the U.S. deputy
                    representative to the Security Council. Sort of curious position, which had
                    organizational problems. The theory was that the responsibilities in the
                    Security Council were so great that you needed three people there: a permanent
                    representative, the deputy permanent representative and the deputy for the
                    Security Council. I never felt that we needed three people. That if the
                    permanent representative wasn't there the deputy permanent representative was
                    around and I was concerned about the duplication of responsibilities between the
                    deputy of the permanent representative and the head of the Political Section.
                    Basically, they were both in the same area. I know how the job got created, I
                    know why it got created in the Stevenson Administration, but it still was not
                    something that I was..., if I were doing it I would redo it. And I tried to redo
                    it. But if you ever want to bump your head against the stone wall, try and get
                    rid off a presidential appointment position. They want to add them. But nobody
                    wants to get rid off them. No administration wants to get rid off them. What I
                    decided to do was to concentrate on some issues. Sure, I exercised oversight
                    over the political policy activities of the Mission, but I got deeply involved
                    in a series of events. Mostly having to do with southern Africa.</p>
                <p>We took on some initiatives on Namibia and Zimbabwe and South Africa. We tried to
                    push those through. We didn't select those issues lightly. There were three
                    issues which the U.S. faced during this time. Three issues which took all of our
                    time. One was southern Africa, the second one was the Middle East, and the third
                    was the North-South dialogue on the economic questions. Those were the issues
                    which took our time and we found ourselves constantly in the minority and what
                    we sought to do was to take the initiative on those areas, and not react to
                    others, but to act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to the issues, how did you find Andy Young
                        in these things? He had great prestige as both a charismatic person, a real
                        personality, certainly not a hacker, or somebody who was hiding his life
                        under a bush or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: It's interesting, the relationship with Andy. As I said, I didn't know
                    him personally. I had not been active in the civil rights movement, no matter
                    what the on-line reference services say to this day. In fact, when there was an
                    indication that Andy was going to be a person designated as permanent
                    representative, we got a call in the State Department from an airplane on
                    Saturday. It was late on Saturday and we were all tired. And the call said,
                    “Andy Young is going to be designated, someone has to brief him.” There were
                    only two logical people to brief Andy Young. One was Bill Maines, who had been
                    in IO, written widely about international organizations, one of the authorities.
                    The other was Don McHenry. Neither one of us wanted to do it. Because, as I
                    said, it was late in the week, none of us had seen our families, we flipped the
                    coin and Bill lost. He had to stay there and brief Andy Young. So, I still
                    didn't know Andy Young. Obviously, I met him later on when there was a
                    discussion about going to U.S.-UN.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I was asked, for the record, to go to the White House to work with Brzezinski. I
                    went over to see Brzezinski, to find out from him what it was he envisioned in
                    terms of the operations of the NSC and specifically what he wanted me to do. He
                    outlined what he wanted, the way he saw these operation, and he outlined what he
                    saw me doing. And he had, as I recall, three areas which he wanted me to
                    oversee. One was Africa, where I had no particular expertise. I mean, I spent a
                    lot of time on the South Africa project, and Africa questions had been part of
                    my daily week when I was in charge of Dependent Areas Affairs in the State
                    Department, but that's a long way from having the specific knowledge of
                    countries. The second one is the wide area of interdependence, of the
                    North-South questions, these questions that cut across nations, regional lines.
                    And that was somewhat intriguing, in that particular era. The third was never
                    clear to me, it had part responsibility for Latin America. But it was only part,
                    because I knew that he was also talking with Bob Pastor. In any event, I went
                    back to the State to the Transition Team, I had a session with Vance, and Vance
                    was, to put it mildly, dead-set against it. I had my own reservations about
                    doing it, but he was dead-set against it. He started talking with me about the
                    new Human Rights Bureau in State Department and I was not interested in being
                    Assistant Secretary for Human Rights. So it meant that transition was just about
                    over, and most transition staff has been assigned some place, and I was not. And
                    then as I said, the heat was put on me to go to New York. It meant moving and it
                    meant working with somebody I didn't know.</p>
                <p>Andy was a charismatic figure, there is no question about it. He had been in the
                    civil rights movement, close to King, and done very well in the Congress on
                    issues which were outside human rights. He'd done commercial issues in Congress
                    for example. He'd never been in any organization that required discipline. The
                    Congress is the last place to do work to prepare you for that. You're your own
                    boss in a sense. He brought with him a staff that had been with him. A number of
                    people that he brought came from the same sort of ideological movement of very
                    liberal human rights, they can do anything, they can change government. Many of
                    those attributes are very positive, very good, you want them around. However,
                    you want people to learn how to get them done. Andy himself had a style and a
                    charm which had many positives. He got attention in terms of the Mission, he got
                    attention in terms of the foreign affairs community, he got attention
                    particularly in terms of the developing world, and that was very important to
                    us. Both North-South and Africa. Andy got attention on the Middle East because
                    there was a view “This is a man of fairness, who will be concerned about the
                    rights of the Israelis, but he would be equally concerned about the rights of
                    the Palestinians.” So, on the contentious issues of our time, Andy just came in
                    with the kind of charisma that you want and kind of the head start that you
                    want. And he was very energetic.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Some of those things had their negative side to them. He's there for the first
                    time in bureaucracy, needs to work as a part of the team. They are needing some
                    degree of discipline. Some need to get expertise to delve into issues, to sit
                    patiently in long, interminable meetings, and he is now not one of 535
                    Congressmen where there is a premium on your speaking your mind, you are now The
                    Representative of The U.S., and there is no such thing as your speaking
                    personally. So, it created in some sense a series of problems. Andy was always
                    making some kind of statement which was so loose that it could have been
                    misinterpreted or it shouldn't have been said in the first place. There was an
                    impression that he was at odds either with the State Department or the White
                    House on this or that. He found it difficult to say “no” to some of the people
                    who had been sort of political and ideological soul-mates for him. He had some
                    difficulty with staffing. He stayed with people who had been his friends and
                    close to him, stayed with them for much too long. Andy was good at getting
                    attention, at opening the door, but it was always necessary for someone to come
                    along and do the detailed negotiation. I ended up being that someone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering, just as this early fit. Here comes Andy
                        Young of the Civil Rights Movement. And he brings with him the like-minded.
                        Here you were, a bureaucrat during the Nixon Administration. In a way “Where
                        were you?” and that sort of thing. Did you find this was a problem
                        initially?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: I didn't find that a problem. I had crossed that bridge. Not in the
                    Nixon Administration but in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations. You have to
                    decide, everyone has to decide what their particular role is in life, and their
                    particular contribution. The Civil Rights Movement was going on. I wasn't
                    unconcerned about it, but after all, one of the objectives of the Civil Rights
                    Movement was to open up the government to give opportunities to people. One of
                    those areas that needed opening up, and there was the shortage of opportunities,
                    was the foreign affairs community. So I saw myself as doing my particular role.
                    I wasn't denigrating anybody else's. But it was mine, and it was a conscious
                    decision on my part to do what I could to develop expertise and to bring
                    perspectives into foreign affairs. And that's what I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I was thinking, there is nothing more intolerant than
                        a young person who is part of a time that has accomplished something
                        great.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>McHENRY: Oh, many of them looked on me as a part of the enemy. There's no
                    question about that. They looked upon me as sort of set in the ways, and have to
                    be watched because I'm not going to be strong enough and aggressive enough and
                    so forth. Not all of them. One of Andy's young people that came there ended up
                    being my closest aid. Stayed with me when Andy was gone and I became permanent
                    representative. Tall chap, sort of gangly and awkward and shy, by the name of
                    Henry Miller. Henry turned out to be very, very hard working, pragmatic,
                    idealistic person who was extremely important in the Namibia negotiations. I
                    can't underscore how important he was. There was the suspicion. It worked both
                    ways, though. Later on, in dealing with the South Africans, South African
                    Foreign Minister, Pik Botha, was quoted, I can't remember where, saying, “The
                    difference between Andy Young and Don McHenry, Andy Young wants to hang us,
                    McHenry wants to hang us with finesse.” That was his way of differentiating
                    between the two of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Al Lowenstein, how did he fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: Al never fit in. Al never understood the operations of government, never
                    bothered to learn how he could pursue his policy objectives in way in which he
                    had a chance of getting them adopted. Some of them could never be adopted
                    because they were just outside the realm. But, he never understood that, and he
                    eventually resigned in frustration and the government was The Government and the
                    people were trying to handicap him and all that kind of stuff. He didn't
                    understand it. He would allow groups and individuals to come in and use his
                    office. No security clearance, nobody knows who they are, it was almost as if
                    they were hanging out. And when you pulled his chain on something like that,
                    instead of his acknowledging that he might have done it differently, you were
                    part of the enemy. He didn't understand it. Al and Brady Tyson were very close
                    together. It was a mistake, just absolutely a mistake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Lowenstein concentrate on the Middle East, being of
                        Jewish origin that might have been his thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: No. It was human rights. Which is a very broad license.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Human rights had been on the agenda for some time, but
                        this is really the first time that you had an administration that was
                        interested in it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: That's right, that was really interested in pushing it in terms other
                    than broad principles.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Human rights actually turned out to be an extremely potent
                        thing. But at the time, how did this play when you first came into the UN
                        with the delegates of the other countries. Because I'm sure you would be
                        talking more to the professionals in a way, since you are a professional and
                        all, what were you getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: Don't forget, most countries had professionals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that's what I mean.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: Most countries do not have the sort of constant changes and refreshing
                    injections of outsiders as the U.S. has, they don't follow that as a practice. I
                    think we got a view among many that this is a new administration, human rights
                    very high, care about the developing countries, care about North-South, and we
                    had a very positive reception. There is no question about that. For a while,
                    there was a sort of a suspicion, can they translate their zeal, new policy
                    directions into policy?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the Soviet Union on some of these,
                        particularly the African issue, were they playing much of a role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: They played a role, but on the three big issue that we were concerned
                    about, southern Africa, North-South and the Middle East, our strategy was to
                    isolate them. We didn't want them involved and screwing up the process by the
                    introduction of ideology. We had to deal with them but we intended to isolate
                    them. It was easiest to do on North-South. Because whereas they would give all
                    kinds of speeches criticizing The Western Countries, and the policies followed
                    by The Western Countries, the countries of the South knew that the Soviet
                    Union's economic policy was an absolute failure and that they weren't
                    contributing towards development either. So, they didn't have much credibility
                    on the North-South questions. And they didn't want to make some of the changes
                    in their own policies which would have been necessary for some kind of
                    North-South dialogue.</p>
                <p>On the Middle East, there had been a longer history of trying to isolate the
                    Soviet Union, at least from the Israeli-Palestinian question. That goes back to
                    Kissinger days, where the view was that the U.S. was going to be the principal
                    actor. We had to keep worrying about the Soviet Union and what it was doing in
                    Syria and so forth, but it was pretty isolated down there.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>On southern Africa you couldn't leave them out. They were close to the liberation
                    movements, they were very close in Mozambique and Angola. What you had to do was
                    to pursue policies which though they didn't like they were not in a position to
                    oppose because the Africans liked them. So we constantly found a situation where
                    if we got the Africans on board, the Soviets would not favor what we were doing,
                    would not like it, but they wouldn't, couldn't block it, because to block would
                    have incurred the wrath of the African countries. The classic example of that is
                    Resolution 435 on Namibia. That Resolution was passed and the Soviet
                    representative in essence said, “We think you are stupid, African countries, to
                    go along with this.”</p>
                <p>That was an approach which was reasonably successful for us. We had used it from
                    the very beginning on the Namibia negotiations, where we got together the five
                    western countries, U.S., UK, France, Germany, and Canada to take a lead in those
                    negotiations and while we kept the Soviets informed, we went out of our way to
                    keep them informed, we were not aiming to get their support. We were aiming to
                    make sure that they couldn't torpedo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you saw it, was the Soviet long-term strategy to hope
                        all hell would break lose in South Africa, and they would take advantage of
                        a revolutionary situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: No, I don't think so. I think, unfortunately, the Cold War clouded our
                    analytical abilities in Africa and any number of other places, in fact most
                    places, I must say. Except those places in which there was a direct threat. I
                    don't think Africa was ever a high priority of the Soviet Union. It was never
                    something that they were going to make a hell of a lot expenditures to get. If
                    they could do something on the cheap, gain an advantage, fine, but there was
                    nothing that they were going to make a great sacrifice over. I believe even in
                    the case of their involvement in Angola that that was largely the Cuban
                    initiatives which backed the Soviets into it, rather then a Soviet initiative
                    and then the Cubans were brought in. It was the other way around. For those who
                    don't believe that the Soviets had reservations about making any great
                    sacrifice, just look at what they did when they dropped Mozambique in
                    Mozambique's hour of real need. South Africans virtually gave Mozambique an
                    ultimatum in the late 1980s and the Soviets said “Don't' come to us.” I think
                    the only place where the Soviets really made an effort was Ethiopia. Even there
                    I wouldn't say that their policy was the bravest thing at all. They were backing
                    Somalia, and found themselves backing a country which was going against one of
                    the cardinal rules of Africa, which is territorial integrity. So they got off
                    that horse, and went up to Ethiopia, and then we stupidly got on the horse they
                    just abandoned.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it mentioned at all on the policy level, if the
                        Soviets are so concerned about national identity and trying to bring about
                        changes in Angola and elsewhere, maybe we can mess around in Azerbaijan or
                        someplace like this. Was this...?</hi>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>McHENRY: No, I never heard that. That doesn't mean that the Agency may not have
                    been doing something like this, but I don't think so. I think the Soviets
                    exploited internal conflict and chaos in development, and we tended to conclude
                    that any place they were was some kind of test of our manhood, and they tended
                    to conclude that any place we were was a test of theirs. Neither of us had a
                    policy which in my view was coherent. And it was dangerous, because my own view
                    was that there was never an overwhelming danger that we or the Soviet Union
                    would consciously decide to use nuclear weapons or to attack the other, or to go
                    consciously or directly into one of the other's sphere of influence. There was
                    always a danger that we would back into some kind of a conflict, in Angola or
                    some place. The two times where you could say that there were exceptions to
                    those two generalizations were Cuban missile crises and that 24 or 28 hour alert
                    which occurred in the Nixon Administration over Middle East. And I'm not sure
                    that those were exceptions, I think both of those two were backing into.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your concentration then was pretty much on Namibia, and...
                        Was Zimbabwe settled at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: No, Zimbabwe was still wide open, and Andy worked a great deal on
                    Zimbabwe. We had an initiative going there which was handled by Steve Low who
                    was our Ambassador in Zambia at the time and Johnny Graham, a British diplomat.
                    Johnny and Steve Low traveled around back and forth, talking to the parties,
                    trying to come up with what they believed was a set of principles which would
                    constitute the basis for settlement in Zimbabwe. One of the sad things of the
                    history is that as one looks back on the settlement in Zimbabwe, there is a
                    tendency to believe that it took place at Lancaster House. Well, Lancaster House
                    would not have been possible without that one-and-a-half, two years of bouncing
                    around that Steve Low and Johnny Graham did. Because they had gone a very long
                    way hammering out the principles. Lancaster House hammered out the last of them,
                    but it was the last of them. It wasn't as if everyone came to Lancaster House
                    with a blank slate and they sat down and they hammered out a deal. It didn't
                    occur that way. But they did Zimbabwe. Andy participated in a number of those
                    things. He went to the meetings in Malta and Cyprus, and Zimbabwe and South
                    Africa. I did some of those, but I tended to do them on the edges of the
                    negotiations which I was doing on Namibia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could explain why the importance of
                        Namibia. Because Namibia is, what I gather, is a hunk of desert. And has
                        disappeared completely off the foreign policy radar, and unlikely to
                        reappear. What was there about Namibia in the '77-'81 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>McHENRY: Well, it's more than a hunk of desert. It's a very attractive place in
                    many respects, but a lot of desert, no question about it. A lot of diamonds too.
                    Lot of animals. No, Namibia was important in terms of the whole, solving the
                    southern Africa problem. And it had always been looked at as even the key or one
                    of the keys to resolving their southern Africa question. Why? In the first
                    place, unlike South Africa or Angola or Mozambique, it was a well established
                    argument that the international community had a responsibility for Namibia. It
                    had been a German colony, then a mandate under the lead of the UN succeeded to
                    the responsibilities of the mandate. The Courts had always upheld that. The
                    courts had blocked South Africa in all of its efforts to take over legally. This
                    had been the place that the international community concentrated its efforts on.
                    Feeling was that it was the easier thing to do, it was the area where one could
                    trace responsibility most directly in terms of the international community, and
                    it was looked upon as South Africa's Achilles' heal in a sense. Because if you
                    could detach Namibia from South Africa you were going a long way towards a)
                    stopping them from extending their practice of apartheid, and b) possibly
                    setting an example of democratic non-racial government right next to this
                    citadel of apartheid. Those were some of the reasons for trying to tackle the
                    Namibia question. But there were other reasons. One of the reasons, which South
                    Africa gave for its involvement militarily in Angola was that Angolan territory
                    was used as a basis for attack on Namibia. Eventually, South Africa would have
                    argued that Namibia was being used as a basis for attack on South Africa. So, it
                    was connected in any number of ways. We believed that if we could resolve the
                    Namibia question, we could take care of, or go a long way towards resolving a
                    number of problems. A) We'd get rid off the question of self-determination in
                    Namibia, people want their own business. B) By doing that you get the South
                    Africans out of Namibia and back over in South Africa. C) If there are no South
                    Africans in Namibia then Angola can't use South African presence in Namibia to
                    argue for Cuba's or anybody else's presence in Angola. So it was a whole series
                    of things. If you could solve the Namibia question, you remove the basis of
                    South Africans' presence in Namibia, Cubans' presence in Angola. The Angolan
                    situation then would have been reduced to what it is, what it has always been in
                    my view, a dispute among Angolans between UNITA and NPLA and any number of other
                    groups. That was the reason that we spent so much time on it.</p>
                <p>And obviously given sensitivity in this country towards anything Cuban, it was
                    very important for political purposes, in terms of keeping the Cubans in check.
                    Since the Cubans were looked upon as surrogates for the Soviets, it was also a
                    way for keeping the Soviets in check. I have already indicated to you, I do not
                    believe that the Soviets went into Angola on their own initiative. I think the
                    Soviets went into Angola largely under pressure from Cubans and there is ample
                    academic research which backs this up. Jerry Lowe's very long piece, which was
                    done at Brookings, is an example of research on this.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>In any event, we felt that we came out, ironically, out of the Ford
                    Administration with the basis of a possible resolution of the Namibia question.
                    The Security Council then, during the latter days of the Ford Administration,
                    had passed Resolution 385 which sought to establish the terms under which the
                    self-determination would come about in Namibia. It was a pretty good resolution.
                    It didn't have any ideology that one normally has in these things, it was
                    moderate in tone, it was pretty good.</p>
                <p>We started out in the Carter Administration. We had on one hand that resolution
                    which was passed by the Security Council, and on the other hand we had
                    Kissinger's on-going initiative with the South Africans. Kissinger, in the
                    latter days of his administration in the last year got involved in the southern
                    Africa issue. He had one initiative on Namibia, which he was doing I think as a
                    trade-off for trying to get the South Africans to cooperate with him on
                    Zimbabwe. Our view unanimously, with this new team coming in, was the UN
                    Resolution offered an opportunity and that the Kissinger initiative was a
                    disaster. The Kissinger initiative was a continuation of a kind of hard hearted
                    policies which had characterized much of that administration. They had agreed
                    with the South Africans on a number of things which we felt were inconsistent
                    with the responsibility of the international community for the area. And we
                    wanted to try and build on the UN Resolution 385. How could you do it? There was
                    the Kissinger initiative outstanding. What we decided to do was to start a new
                    process, where we would come up with this idea of building on 385. That's
                    immediately vetoed. On the grounds that this is the U.S., we've changed
                    governments but the country hasn't changed. We have an initiative out there and
                    we need to follow through on it. We may have to mold it, massage it, change it,
                    but it is out there and the South Africans had been given it, and we need
                    response from them on it, you guys, get the response. I for one thought if they
                    came back and said they wanted to continue that I had no idea what I was going
                    to do. Because it had things in it that I just felt were horrible. They were so
                    horrible that I can't remember precisely what they were, but they were pretty
                    bad. I feared that South Africans would come back wanting to continue. We were
                    lucky. The South Africans had no values or principles, and they felt, I think,
                    “This is a new administration and it's an opportunity for us to start all over
                    again. We don't even have to take a few concessions we gave to Kissinger. We got
                    a lot out from those concessions, but maybe we can get even more from the new
                    crowd.” So, they said they weren't willing to continue on the basis of their
                    prior discussion with Kissinger. They didn't realize that we were joyful when
                    they came back and said that. It gave us a chance to start with a clean slate
                    and that's what we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude of the National Security Council,
                        Brzezinski and with Carter, but particularly Brzezinski? Did he see things
                        as “How to stick it to the Soviet Union?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: At this stage he wasn't a factor on Namibia or southern Africa, and in
                    fact I would say that throughout the administration he was not a factor except
                    in as so far as he could kill things. He became an expert in using bureaucratic
                    ways in delaying things. I'll given you several examples.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>On Angola, It was here that he wanted to inject his own staff. Whenever I went
                    off to Angola usually there was on of the NSC staffers there. It didn't bother
                    me. But he was looking at it from Cold War days. I mean, if you had really been
                    interested in the whole questions, he would have had a staffer when we went to
                    Namibia, to South Africa, to Zimbabwe. But Angola was the only place he was
                    looking at.</p>
                <p>Secondly, we had a debate about recognition, in the Carter Administration, do you
                    recognize Cambodia, Vietnam, Angola? Brzezinski was a no-recognition person. Or
                    if you did you would have to get something from them. So every time we moved on
                    recognition of Angola, he would find some way of stopping it. He would say, in
                    the little note he attaches to a memorandum going off to President, “Mr.
                    President, I think you ought to consult the Hill on this.” Knowing that would
                    kill it. “Mr. President, why don't we tell them that we will recognize them if
                    they do a), b) and c).” It's a non-starter. Absolute non-starter and he knows
                    that. Or, “Mr. President”, this is a variation of the second one, “we will
                    recognize them after they have done a), b), c).” That's a variation, but still a
                    condition. So it's in that kind of way that he was a factor, and usually it was
                    on Angola. I don't know, because I wasn't that involved what went on in terms of
                    Somalia and the Horn. But that was his participation.</p>
                <p>In any event, we took 385 and proposed to the South Africans a... We decided to
                    establish among ourselves a contact group. That is the then five western members
                    of the Security Council. We were ourselves going to undertake the initiative to
                    negotiate this whole Namibia question. We were as close to any of the parties as
                    anyone, had some degree of credibility, and we had some power of authority. We
                    proposed this to the South Africans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “we”, this is the American delegation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: The American delegation, State Department involved, too. There is a long
                    story to dispute this where the idea for the Contact Group originated. Some
                    people say I originated it, some people say Andy originated it, it really was
                    the idea that was originated by Jerry Helman. He became Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary of State for International Organizations. Jerry later became U.S.
                    representative to the European offices. But it was Jerry's idea. Jerry came up
                    with the idea of taking 385 and building on it, putting together this Contact
                    Group which would try through contact with the various players to come up with
                    some kind of framework for Namibia. We tried it out, the idea, first on the
                    Germans, the British, the French, Canadians, at a breakfast which Andy had at
                    the Waldorf. And the reaction of the various representatives was quite positive,
                    except that German representative said, “You know I think this s pretty good, I
                    got to go and check this back in Bonn and get back to you.” Normal procedure.
                    Even the Frenchman who was sitting there, was going to do the same thing. He
                    didn't put it that way but he was going to do it the same way, because you have
                    to.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>That evening, Andy sitting around with press, talking about these new experiences
                    at the UN and things he had to learn, said “Some of these people can't go to the
                    john without...” That wasn't his language, but that was the essence of it.
                    Needless to say, it was in the newspapers the next morning. The German
                    representative, to put it mildly, was pissed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourselves going into Andy Young's office,
                        saying “Here's the world.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: We did it all the time. You did it all the time. When I was with him and
                    he'd say something with the newspaper reporters around, I'd quickly add “That's
                    off the record, fellows.” But I couldn't be with him all day, Jim Leonard
                    couldn't be with him all day, and when Andy got on a theme, even when we told
                    him, “Andy you don't want to do this, you don't way to say this”, you know that
                    at some point in the day he was going to say it around the wrong people. Some of
                    the reporters were extraordinarily good with Andy. That is, they learned that
                    some things Andy would say they simply shouldn't report. Because Andy didn't
                    have the experience, Andy wasn't phrasing it the right way, so they wouldn't do
                    it. Lou Croff, from ABC who ended up being extremely close to Andy, he was very
                    careful about what he would report. But the stringers around, the small
                    newspapers, the guy who was trying to sell a story, those were the ones that you
                    could be sure would pick up whatever Andy said. Sometimes, would adapt it
                    themselves so that it was even further out, and they would write it and there
                    was a problem. That plus the tendency of Andy to speak in shorthand. Andy was
                    excellent in giving the first sentence and the last sentence of his thoughts.
                    And you missed sentences two, three, four. If you heard sentences two, three and
                    four, then the first and the last sentence aren't so bad. But if you haven't
                    heard them, sentence number five was a horror. It got so, that Hodding Carter,
                    who was then the State Department spokesman, starting telling the press as they
                    asked him to respond to something Andy had said, Hodding would say “Look, I am
                    not going to have a comment unless I have seen the whole thing, because I have
                    had experience on this situation before.” There were these instances.
                    Fortunately, as in the case of the German Ambassador, they liked him. They liked
                    his background, they liked him personally, they liked being involved in things
                    he was involved in. In a sense to the extent that the Sun shone on him it
                    reflected on them. And so it was a positive thing. That doesn't say he didn't
                    drive them up the wall on many occasions.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Anyway, we got agreement of these western countries to join us in this
                    initiative. The next thing we had to do was to persuade the African countries
                    that they should in essence sit on the sidelines and moderate some of the
                    resolutions and postpone some of the things they were doing while we pursue the
                    initiative. So we had another breakfast, again at the Waldorf. Again, the
                    special status of Andy was important. Andy convened them, I explained the
                    details of the initiative, and Andy then made a comment about it and they in
                    essence agreed and they said to us at the time “Look, don't do this inside of
                    the Security Council, don't come to the Security Council for the mandate.
                    Because if you come for a mandate we will have to take a position which will
                    either shoot it out of the water or water it down or what have you. Do it on
                    your own. And keep us informed. As Members of the Security Council, as the OAU,
                    keep us informed. When you find need for action and have to come to the Security
                    council, that's OK. But don't come to us to bless this undertaking.” It was good
                    advice. So we then set out on this effort which took the better part of three
                    and a half years. In fact, in the first two years we were able to negotiate
                    Resolution 435, which was the basis of the settlement in Namibia. It was and
                    remained the basis even though the Reagan Administration came along and in my
                    view stood in the way of settlement, helped the South Africans to drag their
                    feet for another almost ten years. In the end they still had to come back to
                    435. It was a fascinating period, fascinating experience with multilateral
                    diplomacy. The Contact Group, made up of five countries acted for the most part
                    as one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to ask you about the role of France. Because
                        normally France is the burr under the American saddle.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: I said, “for the most part acted as one”. We had differences, and those
                    differences would sometimes come out, but even with differences, we did a pretty
                    good job of acting as one. We had problems with the French, in part because
                    their delegation varied in quality. They had excellent working level quality,
                    but when it came time to do something which was on the stage, they would bring
                    in an Ambassador and put him over that working level chap, and more often than
                    not that chap who was brought in simply had neither the background nor the
                    inclination nor the vibes necessary to work with the group. And this frequently
                    happened. There were instances where we got too close to some of their
                    commercial interests. And it was difficult. There were instances where again
                    some of their Ambassadors in the field were difficult. Where they weren't up to
                    snuff in terms of their capabilities or their knowledge, or they were too close
                    to the South Africans and too simplistic in their analysis. One of the French
                    Ambassadors, on his tour of duty in South Africa, made some unfortunate remarks
                    in terms of the motives, specifically my motives, and trying to explain why
                    something must be known as coming out of The Civil Rights Movements and so forth
                    and of course everybody who had worked with me and followed me, which he had
                    not, would not have had that little... The South Africans were bitter, and it
                    was the kind of little things they could use when they wanted to cause
                    trouble.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>The British had excellent representation all the time. Sir James Moray was there,
                    they could be difficult sometimes. There were occasions when David Owen, who was
                    the Foreign Minister, could be very difficult and when their government changed
                    and Margaret Thatcher came it, it nearly put a strain on the Contact Group. Even
                    with those, the Contact Group pulled on negotiation on 435 and worked extremely
                    well. It started fraying at the edges when Mrs. Thatcher came in, and it went to
                    hell in a basket when Reagan came in. The Germans pulled out in protest of
                    American policy, the French pulled out, Canadians pulled out in protest of
                    changes which Reagan introduced. Even the British didn't like what the U.S. was
                    doing but it wasn't very embarrassed. Then by formally pulling out, at that
                    point it didn't make any difference, anyway, since Contact Group meetings were
                    virtually dead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But essentially the bones were laid for the final
                        settlement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: There was no change in settlement even though it came ten years later.
                    They will argue that there were changes, they will argue that the settlement
                    came only after they got an agreement for Cuban withdrawal, but Cuban withdrawal
                    was part of the rationale for 435 and it always was our rationale. I explained
                    that to you earlier. They allowed a situation, frankly, where the Cubans were
                    almost invited to stay because in the Reagan Administration they almost told the
                    South Africans, “You can stay in Namibia so long as there are Cubans in Angola.”
                    What do you do if you are South Africa and you don't want to get out? You follow
                    policies which ensure that the Cubans stay in Angola. And that's what they did
                    for ten years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking this might be a good point to stop this.
                        We'll pick up to finish off this segment next time. We basically talked
                        about Namibia and the staff and the UN and Al Lowenstein, and
                        Brzezinski</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: Let's do a little bit more on Namibia because I think there are some
                    important things in terms of multilateral diplomacy which are reasonably
                    important. First the term Contact Group which you see later on, you see it on
                    Yugoslavia, Cambodia, it becomes this approach of group of countries working on
                    a problem, dedicated group working on a problem. It then starts to get used.
                    Secondly, just the operation, trying to mold a single policy out of three, four,
                    five countries in this case, it's an interesting thing. I say this because I've
                    just finished in July and August on a delegation which the Secretary General
                    sent to Algeria. Again, five countries represented and done in a way in which
                    one could not operate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 26th of October 1998. Last time we pretty much finished
                        with Namibia but you mentioned at the end about the development in Namibia
                        of the Contact Group. You said this is an important concept that got started
                        there. I wonder if you could talk a bit about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>McHENRY: The contact group was a group of five counties put together on the
                    Namibia question, working together. It worked out policies and plans and met
                    together very frequently, and was the group that negotiated 435, the principle
                    document for settlement of Namibia. The group traveled together, met together
                    constantly, worked out speeches, papers, demarches. The concept, we may well see
                    in Bosnia. You saw it to some extent in Haiti. That and the idea of getting
                    antagonists together in one place. To some extent Carter did this at Camp David.
                    We did it with regard to the Contact Group and we called it “Proximity Talks.”
                    We got all the parties together in one city, one location, the theory being that
                    it's far more efficient than shuttle diplomacy and to some extent it put a
                    little more pressure on the parties. So we used those two concepts, the contact
                    group and the idea of proximity talks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was in your Contact Group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: Five western members of the Security Council, three permanent members,
                    France, U.S. and UK, and elected members at that time were Canada and the
                    Federal Republic of Germany. It was a quite useful, very close working
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you and the other members of the Contact Group given
                        pretty much a very loose rein from your principles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: Yes, we were given a lot of rope. But we worked very well with the
                    principles. On two occasions the foreign ministers from the Contact Group
                    countries came together in New York at the UN, on one occasion the group
                    traveled to South Africa for negotiations that foreign ministers did. So the
                    concept there worked out pretty well. On the South Africa question it was
                    particularly important because these were the countries that South Africa, if it
                    had any friends in the world, had any people who were going to understand its
                    point of view, those were the countries that would. Having a united front among
                    those five countries was very important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think, being an ex-bureaucrat myself, that you
                        would have trouble, maybe not with your top people, not with the foreign
                        minister, secretary of state, but the support staff, the desk, the bureau,
                        and this would be true of every other member of the group, they would see
                        things and being away from the thing that would always look for the
                        perfection, “Why don't you go right rather then left?”, and that sort of
                        thing. I mean, this is bureaucracy in action.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>McHENRY: Actually, it worked out pretty well. The tensions were there sometimes.
                    We at U.S. UN had to work very closely with the Bureau of International
                    Organization Affairs, in the State Department with the Bureau of African
                    Affairs, with Policy Planning, with the Economic Bureau because one of the
                    things we did as a contingency was to figure out what kinds of sanctions we
                    could use if the negotiations didn't go well. We also had to work with the
                    Defense Department because we used them to provide us with technical expertise
                    in terms of some of the military aspects of the agreement that we were working
                    out. That is, what was militarily feasible to do. I don't say that there weren't
                    differences and tensions some time. I found that on the whole we at U.S. UN were
                    less second guessed than the British. Second guessed by the Foreign Office. We
                    had far more ability and maneuverability. Part of that was my own relationship
                    with the principle actors in Washington. After all I had grown up with these
                    chaps. And my own relationship with first Vance and also the President. And all
                    along the line we used this mechanism to keep them informed and constantly get
                    the feedback. It was a very useful device. Was it complicated? Yes, any time you
                    try to get five countries to agree on the language of the demarche, or a
                    demarche, and so forth, there were some examples where we didn't work so well.
                    These were usually informal things, rather than formal things. But on the whole
                    I think it was a good undertaking and that there were some positive things which
                    came out of it. In terms of how to attack a problem. And of course, the whole
                    way in which Namibia was proposed as a settlement was then copied in the
                    Cambodian settlement. The whole process was copied.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought, say with the French. The French are
                        not exactly renowned as being team players. Although the French probably had
                        less of a stake in this than most, did this help, or how did you feel about
                        the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: The French created problems sometimes. Part of the problem was that they
                    had changed governments early on in the process. They did not assign a
                    high-level official to follow things. There was too great a distance between
                    their representative in New York and the staffer working on things. They didn't
                    have a kind of staff support in the field that the U.S. or the UK had. And
                    sometimes they were a little cynical about the process, cynical about the
                    bone-fides of the South Africans. We shared some of their doubts, but he took
                    the position that we had to push the South Africans, that we had to test them,
                    we couldn't assume that they would not do the right thing. At the same time the
                    French had representation in the place that neither the U.S. nor the UK or
                    Germany or Canada, had. Angola. Angola was the key spot. It meant that every
                    time we went to Angola we had to depend on the French for support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that Germans, since they had played
                        such a controlled and modest role in the world scene, at least that's my
                        impression, that they would be under a lot of referring back to Bonn. Did
                        you find that...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>McHENRY: I'm sure they referred back to Bonn, but I think their position was
                    quite strong. When we traveled, someone from Bonn was usually on their
                    delegation. They had a very strong role until... I think their role changed when
                    the principle chap for Africa died early in the process. The Germans got a
                    special interest. They were on the Security Council. It was in a sense a
                    recognition of their role. And second, of course, they had been the mandate
                    power in Namibia, and there were many Germans in Namibia, some of whom could
                    influence German internal politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have a colleague who is doing a sister program with the
                        British Foreign Service, Oral History. I just got a letter from him and he
                        was saying that he was somewhat discouraged by seeing the modest role that
                        the British played in moving Foreign affairs issues. Yet, other people I've
                        talked to said that the British are not only sort of with us but also very
                        much equal guides on things. How did you find the British?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: I think that depends on the issue. The British were quite involved on
                    Zimbabwe, as you could expect, on Namibia, South Africa, on Angola. In some
                    instances they were quite delighted to have an interest but to not be too
                    involved, not have to carry the responsibility, to be free to do their own
                    thing. They couldn't get as distant from things as the French, who were able to
                    do it, although there were times when I'm sure they would want to be more
                    distant. The British have historical ties to much of the Third World obviously
                    and some of those ties continue in the form of Commonwealth relationships or in
                    the form of the economic interest. The economic interest sometimes particularly
                    presented a problem to the British. How can you on the one hand do the right
                    thing and at the same time protect your economic interest? They are frequently
                    incompatible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, with the French, you always have to worry
                        about the French sensibilities of not being acknowledged. Did you find this
                        with the British at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: No, I don't think so. And I would say that the Contact Group worked
                    extraordinarily well in terms of cultural sensitivities. As a matter of fact I
                    think it's fair to say that there were many times when the group was so close
                    together that it was despised by all foreign offices. Because we had our own
                    view, our own knowledge of one another, our intimate knowledge of what the facts
                    were on the ground, and foreign offices were sometimes deprived. For the U.S. we
                    tried to avoid that, because we usually traveled with someone from the State
                    Department, that is Don Peterson, who was the Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                    Africa traveled with us on the Contact Group much of the time and was able to do
                    quite well.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>It was an interesting story, because when we first proposed the Contact Group to
                    the South Africans and they agreed to have discussions, the South Africans,
                    before we had even designated who our representative was going to be, they took
                    it upon themselves and tried to make sure that at least one potential person was
                    not going to be American representative and his name was Don McHenry. And they
                    went into the State Department dropping all kinds of hints, suggestions, not in
                    too subtle way, as the South Africans are known to be. I think it was Bill
                    Edmondson who was then Deputy Assistant Secretary, let them know in no uncertain
                    terms that the U.S. selected its own personnel, and I took over as the U.S.
                    representative on those negotiations and really took over as sort of nominal
                    head.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you all deal with the South Africans and Angolans,
                        when they came up against this group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: The Group very carefully decided in advance what it wanted to do. We
                    wrote our demarche together. We decided in advance of a discussion who was going
                    to lead it, who was going to make whatever public statement and what the public
                    statement was going to be, we even decided if there was a particularly nasty
                    questions that had to be asked and we knew that the South Africans were going to
                    be furious, we decided who was going to ask the nasty question because we wanted
                    to pass it around and we didn't want the South Africans to get in the position
                    to pick off any country. If we went into a negotiation and there were five, six,
                    seven aspects of it, we knew who was going to handle each one of them. The South
                    Africans didn't know it, and it may have sounded as if it was unplanned, but it
                    was very planned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were through with this, obviously this continued
                        to be a process, the type of contact group, your think this became a part of
                        diplomatic repertoire?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>McHENRY: Unfortunately with regard to the U.S., with regard to Namibia the
                    Contact Group basically died. It technically continued to be in existence but
                    the new administration came in with the view that the Contact Group was too
                    complicated. It had negotiated 435, but they took it as too complicated. There
                    wasn't enough American leadership, though everyone acknowledged that the U.S.
                    was basically in front of the Contact Group. Instead of having negotiations take
                    place and be led out of New York, Jack Crawford in the Reagan Administration
                    wanted to do it here in Washington. That gave it a bilateral tone, as opposed to
                    a multilateral tone which we had tried very hard to keep in the negotiations. It
                    also raised resentment among some of the Contact Group members that it was the
                    U.S. asserting, taking over the negotiations if you will, and sort of deciding
                    and informing the other countries as opposed to all of us sitting down and
                    deciding together. It may have been the appropriate thing to do, given the
                    policy decisions that the U.S. decided to take. The U.S. decided to push its
                    anti-communism, its own analysis of Angola and southern Africa, an analysis with
                    which I disagreed at the time and totally disagreed with as things developed.
                    The U.S. also decided to put the withdrawal of Cubans ahead of the settlement of
                    the Namibia question, and in essence told the South Africans they didn't have to
                    get out of Namibia until the Cubans got out of Angola. Those kinds of policy
                    decisions lead to the undoing of the Contact Group. The U.S. pushed itself ahead
                    as the bilateral speaker, secondly it took policy positions which others were
                    uncomfortable with. First, the French and then the Canadians and then the
                    Germans, all distanced themselves from the positions that the U.S. had taken.
                    The Canadians and the French decided to withdraw from the Contact Group. The
                    grounds for the withdrawal, for all practical purposes it didn't exist. The
                    Germans also acknowledged that for all practical purposes it didn't exist though
                    they tried to continue to work with the U.S. The British, unlike the French and
                    the Canadians and the Germans, never publicly denounced the policy changes which
                    the U.S. had made, thought they had some sympathy for it, don't forget Mrs.
                    Thatcher has just...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just going to say, we are talking about the politics
                        of the leadership, and Reagan was not a strong figure and was very
                        anti-communist...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: Yes, Mrs. Thatcher had come in as well. I think on the substance, even
                    the British had strong reservations and were strongly critical of some of the
                    positions which the U.S. took. The CG in essence on Namibia basically died on
                    the vine, and we had ten years of back-and forth negotiations, or nine years,
                    with the Reagan Administration. They claimed that they made a lot of changes and
                    that they enabled them to enter in an agreement, but the fact is that they still
                    based the whole settlement on 435. And while they would say that the pullout of
                    the Cubans was an important key, the fact is again that the Cubans ended up
                    pulling out only after the South Africans had made the mistake of taking on the
                    Cubas and the Angolans, and they were trounced. Or at least lost so many people
                    that they decided it wasn't worth it. I would say that Namibia with the right
                    kind of pressures, Namibia and Angola could have been resolved eight years
                    earlier.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we talk about your recent use of a group,
                        somewhat similar, when you went to Algeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: I went to Algeria on so-called Eminent Persons Group for the Secretary
                    General of the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: This is the summer of 1998. The Algerians had been sharply criticized
                    since the early '90s, particularly around 1992, when they refused to go ahead
                    with the elections because they were concerned that the Islamic fundamentalists
                    would get control of the government. And the Algerians had used some pretty
                    rough methods to put fundamentalists out. And the fundamentalists had in turn
                    used some horrible methods and continue to use some pretty horrible methods as
                    they fight the Algerian government. The Algerians had been criticized by the
                    international community, human rights commission, various NGOs, they had been
                    resistant to any international investigation or oversight of the developments
                    within their country. They finally agreed to a visit by a group of eminent
                    persons under the agency of the Secretary General to look at and report to the
                    Secretary General on the developments within Algeria. The Secretary General put
                    together a group consisting of the former president of Portugal, the former
                    Prime Minister of India, the former Prime Minister of Jordan, the former
                    Minister from France, the Attorney General from Kenya and myself. We went there,
                    the five of us, and spent some time going around the country, meeting with
                    government officials, NGOs, opposition groups, political leaders, the press,
                    business, whole range of folks, and reported back to the Secretary General on
                    our findings. It was a report which the Secretary General then made public. It
                    was an experience which was quite different from my experience with the Contact
                    Group on Namibia. And I would say it was how not to run this kind of multiple
                    participant group.</p>
                <p>On the Namibia process, we had no chairman. We sort of informally designated
                    someone to be the spokesperson or to lead the presentation and so forth. And
                    it's true that the U.S. 90% of the time was that, but we had no chairman.
                    Without the chairman you are relieved from all sort of hierarchy which goes into
                    multilateral process. And if you have to ever be reminded that everybody is
                    equal in the absence of the chairman, bring that on. The chairman brings on
                    something of the idea that there is a pecking order. This is particularly true,
                    I found this particularly true with the chairman who was selected. It was Mario
                    Suarez from Portugal. It may have been that a different kind of personality
                    would have done it differently. Suarez in the first place was up in age, that
                    affected our work schedule, how quickly we could do things. Secondly, he had a
                    tendency to treat staff in a manner in which I would not. Staff is staff and
                    they know that but you can learn a lot from the staff. When someone gives you
                    advice on the basis of their experience on how to handle a particular item, you
                    would do well to at least listen and in too many instances the chairman was
                    dismissive to the point of not even listening.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Well, I would say that while the process came out okay, it would have come out
                    much better, we could have made more of an impact in the Algerian situation. As
                    it is, the Algerians have the report, but if the report had been released in a
                    different way in New York with the Committee members present it would have been
                    quite different from the way it was released, sort of passed to the Secretary
                    General who released it to the press without the kind of attention that you'd
                    want to get.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see the situation in Algeria, we're still
                        talking about how it is today, what was the thrust of your Group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McHENRY: I think that Group believed that the Algerians had a particularly
                    difficult situation. They have made a considerable process in changing the
                    country from one with clear military dictatorship to one where there is a
                    civilian government and various branches of the government. Changing the
                    government from one where there was a heavy state ownership on everything to one
                    where they are moving over for a capitalist society. And changing the government
                    from one party to multi-parties. Those things they have done and those are
                    substantial changes in structure. The trick, however, is to give life and
                    substance to those things. To make sure that the public sees that the civilian
                    government is in charge and is not suspicious that the military isn't still
                    running it. To make sure that there is translation in the micro-economy of the
                    kinds of changes that you have made in the macro-sense. You got to follow
                    through with privatization of business, with competition and so forth. The
                    public needs to see that protection of individuals in society are operating and
                    therefore you've got to have transparency in the government, in the police,
                    people have to have a swift trial and a fair trial, to be seen at those. I guess
                    what I'm saying is they have made a number of structural changes which are very
                    important, which changed the direction of their government, potentially. Now
                    they have to go through the process of insuring that they work, of giving the
                    people the confidence that they actually mean it. Not that it's the same thing
                    under a different guise. And they have to do this under very adverse
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>They have terrorism going on, from the Middle East who don't like the change and
                    want to take the government in the opposite direction. They have very, very high
                    growth rate with unemployment, very high, 40% of the youth are unemployed and
                    the youth make up 70% of the population. They have a severe housing shortage,
                    they have corruption from the past, and they are trying to do all this in an
                    economy which is based entirely on petroleum, at the time when petroleum is
                    down. It's a very difficult process for them. I think they can do it but they
                    are going to have to put their nose to the grindstone, which means they will
                    have to do some things in very different ways than they have done.</p>
