                <p>ANN MILLER MORIN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Jewell Fenz</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: June 21, 1988</p>
                <p>Q: This is Jewell Fenzi on June 21, 1988. I am interviewing Ann Miller Morin,
                    Mrs. Laurent Morin, at her home in Washington, DC. Mrs. Morin has served in
                    Algiers, Algeria; Le Havre and Paris, France; Kobe, Japan; Baghdad, Iraq;
                    Algeria again; and her husband was an Inspector in the Department. She received
                    her Master's degree in 1960 at the University of Maryland. Her thesis dealt with
                    “educating Foreign Service children,” and indicated that Foreign Service
                    children benefit from the life they lead more than they suffer from it. We
                    should bear in mind that this was 28 years ago.</p>
                <p>Now Ann is engaged in an oral history project — interviewing women ambassadors,
                    and she has interviewed most of the living women ambassadors. In addition to
                    talking to her today about her Foreign Service life — during which time she
                    taught and managed to work, either for a salary or as a volunteer, during
                    practically all of her husband's entire career, which ended in 1979 — I want to
                    talk to her about her current project.</p>
                <p>So, now you're going to the Eisenhower Library to do what?</p>
                <p>MORIN: They're having a conference, whose over-all title is “Women in the
                    Eisenhower Period” but they asked me to give a half-hour address on the general
                    subject of women ambassadors. I don't quite know how they want me to tailor it,
                    but I have so much material that that poses the problem — to winnow it down to
                    exactly what they want, because you can't say much in 30 minutes. Julie Nixon
                    Eisenhower will be the keynoter the night before the conference opens. Then
                    there's someone from the Army and the Navy and from government service and from
                    business, and so forth.</p>
                <p>This is a very unusual step for, or all places, the Eisenhower Library to take,
                    because Eisenhower was not known for his interest in women's affairs, and the
                    historians around town are very excited about it because this seems to be a
                    breakthrough. I mean, if Eisenhower Library is sponsoring a thing like this, it
                    augurs very well for women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much do you attribute to Julie Nixon Eisenhower?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MORIN: Oh, quite a bit, everybody does, yes. It was nice to know that word about
                    America's women ambassadors is getting out and that people are really interested
                    in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get started on the project?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Jean Wilkowski, who was the first woman ambassador to an African post —
                    she went tZambia, appointed by Nixon — had served with my husband and me in
                    Paris. One evening in 1983 she was here with mutual friends. We hadn't seen Jean
                    since we'd left Paris in 1954 because she'd gone to her continents and we'd gone
                    to ours. But we'd heard of her through friends, you know; and so we were
                    catching up. My husband said to Jean, “Ann doesn't teach any more, she's
                    writing, exclusively.” Her eyes brightened and she said, “I want to talk to
                    her.” So afterwards she took me aside and said, “I'm very interested in finding
                    somebody to write a book about women ambassadors, for the simple reason that as
                    I go about the country lecturing on the subject, after the addresses I give
                    there are always questions, “Where can I find out more about the subject?” And
                    she said, “I've searched everywhere, there is nothing. There's 'something' on
                    Jeane Kirkpatrick, 'something' on Shirley Temple Black, there's plenty on Clare
                    Boothe Luce. When you've said that, you've said it.”</p>
                <p>“So,” she said, “I very much want to — would you be interested?” She thought at
                    the time that she could get a foundation grant, which since proved not possible
                    because we were going at it just at the time the President cut off aid to
                    non-profit foundations, etc. Well, her query prompted very serious misgivings on
                    my part. Having written several books, I know what's involved in that. But
                    adding to that, all of this business about the oral histories, I thought, “Oh,
                    boy, the research... It's a long, long project.” And Jean, who is used to doing
                    things by committees, thought it could be done in 18 months. I burst out
                    laughing — “It's just not possible. I will accept, Jean, but only on the
                    understanding you will help me, and you will make me known to the proper
                    people.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pave the way for you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Pave the way. So that's exactly what we did. She took me in to see George
                    Vest and Sam Gammon and all kinds of people who “knew where the bodies are
                    buried.” I put together a list of people I wanted to see, and we went at it —
                    not exactly systematically but there was a plan in mind. First of all, in order
                    to apply for money from foundations, I had to have a very clear picture of what
                    I wanted to do. That made me focus my thinking and I made an outline of a book,
                    and so forth. We wrote some proposals, but we didn't have any luck at all with
                    that because we weren't backed by a institution. And it wasn't until, oh, about
                    a year after I had been working independently, that the Association for
                    Diplomatic Studies (ADS) came into being, I went to talk to Gene (Bovis) and to
                    Dick (Parker). I said, “I need your backing.” And also it would be something
                    that they could talk about when they brought in other people.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just going to say — that was very much a two-way
                        street,when they were getting started.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes, sure. So it worked out very well, and they agreed — if I could get
                    any money — to process it for me, i.e., make it tax-exempt for us. So that was
                    fine. I started doing the oral histories — I knew I had to interview these
                    women, because the whole thrust of the book was to be that this was all new
                    material, told to me “from the horse's mouth,” so to speak. Well, Jean called me
                    up and said, “I've heard from the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe and they want
                    to do an oral history of Carol Laise.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Women in Federal Government.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes. They only contemplated two women ambassadors — they already had
                    finished Margaret Tibbetts; the other — the very last one they were doing,
                    actually — was to be Laise.They had somebody here at the Brookings Institute who
                    was supposed to do it. She couldn't, so they wanted Jean. She responded, “I'm
                    not interested in doing this, but I'll ask them if you can do it.”</p>
                <p>So I had to present my r�sum� and all that sort of thing and they finally
                    approved of me — I think because I had done the other work on Foreign Service
                    children. Anyway, I did it for them, and Carol Laise was my very first
                    interviewee. She's a very good one because she speaks very slowly an(laughing) I
                    was able to overcome all my initial nervousness. I had done a lot of
                    interviewing before, but nothing that was going into an archive. It does put —
                    as I'm sure you know and feel too! — a bit of a strain on you. So, having done
                    that, the project was under way. And I decided “since I'm doing one all the way
                    through, it's a wonderful idea to do them all all the way through.”</p>
                <p>I knew some library would want the oral histories, because the Schlesinger
                    Library was crazy about this idea. Of course, they haven't any money either:
                    nobody has any money in the l980s for this sort of project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why does Schlesinger not have any money? Isn't
                        Radclifffinancing them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: No, it was a Ford grant they had, and they had spent just about all of it,
                    and they couldn't get any more — I went up and talked to them, and while they're
                    very interested in the project, they don't have any money. Well, how did I get a
                    grant? I was interviewing Anne Cox Chambers, and she is a billionaire, with a b.
                    Her father was Cox, onetime governor of Ohio, who owned the Cox radio-newspaper
                    chain in the South, and she inherited it and now has gone into television, Cox
                    Cable, I think it's called. It's a big thing all through the South and she's
                    just coining money.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Anyway, I was interviewing her, and she asked, “How much longer is it going to
                    take you?” I said, quite openly, “Well, I'm not certain because I'm hampered by
                    lack of money to travel.” And she said, “Isn't the State Department paying your
                    way?” I said, “No, I'm paying everything myself.” She said, “I think that's
                    awful!” And I replied, “Well, that's the way it is, Mrs. Chambers. I'll let you
                    know — yours is done and you'll be getting it but I have to get transcription
                    money too.”</p>
                <p>I hadn't been home a couple of weeks when I got a phone call from one of her
                    lawyers, who said, “Mrs. Chamber(she laughs) wants to give you some money.”
                    (both laugh heartily) And I thought, we don't discourage gestures of that kind.
                    Then he asked the key question: “Are you connected to a non-profit organization?
                    If you're not, that's all right, she wants to give it to you anyway. But if you
                    are, that will expedite matters.” I think what he meant was, I would get more,
                    because if it weren't tax-free, although she would give me the same amount, I
                    would net less. So she did. She gave me $10,000.00 and it was channeled through
                    ADS and those blessed people gave me every penny.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They do us, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Columbia University wanted 65 percent of everything, American University
                    wanted 33 percent of everything; which is fair enough, that's the way they do
                    it. But I mean, 100 percent is better.(she breaks down in laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But bear in mind that we both are doing Dick Parker a
                        favor, in wa(Morin assents) because we're enhancing his project.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Of course we are. And our time is absolutely free. If wwere getting paid
                    what oral historians get paid, it couldn't be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, absolutely not.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MORIN: But again, this is the Foreign Service theme: It is the esprit de corps
                    that we had and still continues in us. I don't know if it continues with the new
                    people. Possibly it does, with many of them, I'm sure. But this is something —
                    if you've devoted your life to a cause, it makes you want to make it seem a very
                    worthwhile thing, and therefore, you throw everything into it. And you know,
                    Jewell, the fact of the matter is that it's a very important thing, because if
                    we don't do it pretty soon, there will be nobody around to tell what the Foreign
                    Service was like. And there have been “sea changes” since we came in. I came in
                    a little before you did, and I can see even more because I had little children
                    who had to be educated and had to have doctors and things, and there were no
                    allowances at that time. So it's something that should be recorded. And, just by
                    the way, since I've begun my project, four of “my” women ambassadors have
                    died.So you see, the only one of the four I was able to interview was Clare
                    Boothe Luce. One died the week before I was to see her — Nancy Rawls. And once
                    the person has died, it is very difficult to understand that person well enough
                    to write about her, without ever having seen her.</p>
                <p>Q: My husband could talk to you about Nancy Rawls, because he was the Economic
                    officer in Sierra Leone, anNancy was Economic officer in Liberia and we used to
                    see her; I know he was in touch with her. Whether he had any contact with her
                    while she was ambassador in Togo, I don't know. But she must have followed
                    Dwight Dickinson there, about 1975 or '76. I recall writing Nancy and saying my
                    daughter was coming to Togo as a Peace Corps volunteer, so Dwight must have gone
                    by that time. So, for Frances Willis you must have had to rely on [people who
                    knew her].</p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes, and it means you have to do many more interviews.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you get things from the files through Freedom
                        oInformation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: I have been to the presidential libraries, and there isn't very much on
                    Willis, just on specific issues she dealt with. I found some items on her in the
                    Department's nexus file; I also talked to her relatives. Her brother was living
                    in California and I was in process of making arrangements, held up because I
                    didn't have money to travel, when he died. So his daughter sent me a great many
                    things, and I talked to her cousins, Mrs. Richard Sanger, whose husband was a
                    Foreign Service officer who lives here [in DC], and her sister, Mrs. Pomeroy.
                    The two of them gave me a lengthy interview. (mimicking a woman's high-pitched
                    voice) “About Franny — you want to know about Franny?” It was fun to get it from
                    the private side, and of course they had insights no one else would have. But
                    they didn't know much about the public side. So you have to do a lot of extra
                    spadework. It was very interesting because they are very lovely women.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I told them I was also interested — later, after this is done — in perhaps
                    writing a biography of Frances Willis for young teenagers, because they need
                    role models and Willis is certainly a good one. Well, the next thing I knew, I
                    got a big cardboard box of memorabilia that belonged to Frances Willis. They'd
                    sent me some of her certificates, some of her medals, a lot of photograph
                    albums, a little journal-type of thing she kept — wonderful stuff. And in her
                    own words, you see. So I have been quoting from that rather freely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Needless to say!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes. Because I don't have her to say it. The rest of her stuff is all at
                    Stanford and I expect eventually I will give this material to Stanford
                    University. Unless ADS wants it — I don't know how much they want, not knowing
                    how much space they'll have.</p>
                <p>Q: And who knows when that new complex is going to be built. (both express
                    approval that the tapes will go to Georgetown, thus offering people immediate
                    access to the material when it's turned over) So, until Anne Cox Chambers
                    offered you a nice grant, you really financed everything yourself.</p>
                <p>MORIN: Totally.</p>
                <p>Q: To what extent were you willing to go?</p>
                <p>MORIN: Oh, I'd be willing to go to whatever I had to. I a(she laughs) a very
                    dogged individual and I don't look on this as a monetary thing. Obviously I
                    don't. It is something that stimulates me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Retirement pastime” which you're willing to invest
                        in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Well, of course, it's more than a pastime, it really is a profession — our
                    lives are built around this project and my husband's work at the State
                    Department; this is “what it is.” And for the last seven weeks, we have worked
                    seven days a week. This is what we do. And we love it. I love meeting the people
                    — you asked me how much have I put in. Up to the time when Anne Chambers gave me
                    the money, I had put in around $13,000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So her grant really reimbursed you, more or less.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MORIN: More or less. And then, you see, Jean Wilkowski gave some money to ADS to
                    help me buy supplies. And Ambassador Holsey Handyside, bless his heart, gave me
                    the money to take a trip. He's a very close friend of ours, and when he heard I
                    couldn't get out to California to interview Shirley Temple Black and India
                    Edwards — fascinating subject — he gave me the money for air fare through ADS.
                    Then this past Christmas, he gave me some more money. So little things are
                    coming in that way. Rosemary Ginn sent a check for $300 to help in the
                    transcription of her tapes. So Dick and I are going to ask the subjects if they
                    will help me with the transcription costs.</p>
                <p>(some discussion on this subject off microphone)</p>
                <p>MORIN: I belong to a Biography Group which you might be interested in attending.
                    It doesn't have a name, it's led by Marc Pachter, who is the historian for the
                    Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery. There was an all-day symposium there on
                    biography, and David McCullough was there and Phyllis Rose and others. Marc was
                    the moderator and at that time said, “If anybody is interested in forming a
                    group so we can discuss this more, come ahead and sign up.” Enough of us did so
                    we've been meeting ever since, once a month, usually on a Tuesday evening. We
                    discuss the problems that we all have in writing biographies, funding, anything
                    — it can be technical, ethical, inspirational, whatever you want. But it's a
                    very good group and everybody is working on something. There's another FS couple
                    there, Ned and Nancy Schaefer. A lot of people are working on family projects.
                    (Fenzi says she'd be interesting in joining; Morin cites several other members'
                    names and what they're doing, and title of Pachter's book, Telling Lives. Morin
                    also says she belongs to Washington Independent Writers, whose annual
                    conferences she finds very worthwhile for networking, and the Oral History
                    Association, a national organization. Further discussion along these lines.</p>
                <p>Q: To return to your project, I can see it has become all-consuming, it has
                    become professional. [break in tape] We had started to discuss publishing your
                    book and I wanted to ask you: In your interviews with women ambassadors, did
                    anything ever come up about the spouses that they had to work with? Did you ever
                    focus on that at all? Did it creep into the conversation?</p>
                <p>MORIN: I asked definite questions about them. The fact of the matter is that
                    spouses, to date, have not been a very important factor with the women
                    ambassadors. In Clare Boothe Luce's case, her husband was already a highly
                    important man, and he opened an office in Rome so that he could be there. She
                    took the job with the understanding that he would spend six months a year in
                    Rome, and then they would have a three-month vacation — that's how things were
                    back in the 1950s — and the other three months he'd be somewhere else and she'd
                    be there alone, so she wouldn't be there alone too long — it was bad for her
                    marriage, she said.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Eugenie Anderson's husband was wealthy in his own right; his father invented the
                    puffed wheat/rice process, so he didn't work. He's a photographer and artist and
                    was able to transport what he did. He also traveled a great deal. Patricia
                    Harris's husband was a judge, who went with her, but both had difficulty. She
                    seems to have been the dominant one in that partnership and was always extremely
                    sensitive about the way he was treated by local people, although I understand he
                    did a very fine job and was very good. Now, you'll notice that all of these
                    women I'm talking about are non-career ambassadors. Of the career ambassadors in
                    the time period we're discussing — 1933-1983 — only 17 of my 44 are career
                    women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how many of them were married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: (after reflection) Laise, Jane Coon, Melissa Wells — and, until I check
                    the list, that's it. Bunker was ambassador to Vietnam, Carlton Coon was
                    ambassador to Nepal when Jane was ambassador to Bangladesh — they were the first
                    “tandem couple” ever sent out as ambassadors at the same time. Bunker was
                    already in Vietnam when Laise was given Nepal, perhaps because it was “feasible”
                    — he had an airplane and he could commute; they spent time once a month together
                    in one country or the other. And, although Laise was of the career, Bunker was
                    not.</p>
                <p>Anne Cox Chambers' husband was with her but they divorced shortly afterwards.
                    Ruth Farkas's husband was with her some of the time. He died shortly
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>An interesting one is Anne Armstrong's husband. He's a wealthy cattleman but he
                    went with her, and I was told that he looked on his wife “with fond indulgence”
                    — I thought that was a wonderful phrase. He took over a lot of her
                    representational duties — he would open fairs and that sort of thing when she
                    was busy with other duties. He was most helpful to her. He went with her to the
                    presentation of credentials and so forth, all dolled up, and she in her long
                    white gown, when the glass coach came after her — a lot of color there.</p>
                <p>[Florence] Daisy Harriman was a widow. Ruth Bryan Owen married a Dane and had to
                    give up her post, as did Helene von Damm, as you know. She took a husband to
                    Vienna with her, divorced him, married a Viennese, and had to give up her job.
                    Faith Whittlesey is a widow. So I think you cannot compare the spousal problem
                    of non-career ambassadors to the spousal problem of women ambassadors from the
                    Foreign Service, because the formers' husbands are usually very successful men,
                    or else it doesn't work and they get a divorce. Well, of course that happens,
                    too, among Foreign Service people, but the majority of women career ambassadors
                    in my sample have never married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any talk at all about the relationship between
                        thwoman ambassador and, say, the spouse of her DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MORIN: Yes. Usually it works very well and the DCM's spouse is very helpful, and
                    quite often will take over the role that the ambassador's wife usually
                    performs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Without pay, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Of course! (both laugh heartily) Well, the ambassador's wife doesn't get
                    paid, you see. These women ambassadors are all trailblazers, so the first things
                    that happen are sort of “worked through” with them. When the Geneva Conference
                    of l953 took place, a summit with Khrushchev and Eisenhower, Frances Willis was
                    the American ambassador. She didn't have a wife, obviously, so the wife of her
                    DCM went with her to the Conference and was the ranking wife there among
                    diplomats, while her husband stayed home in Bern and “ran the shop.” But his
                    wife went as “the wife.” So it's interesting the way these things evolve. And,
                    by the way, they “sat below the salt” because there were so many “important”
                    people there!(both laugh heartily)</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I can see you are enjoying it — and isn't it interesting the things
                    you're finding out that you never really thought about, aboutthe Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>MORIN: Fascinating, fascinating.</p>
                <p>Q: Because your emphasis, really, was on education, wasn't it? (says she read
                    Morin's article drawn from her thesis, found it fascinating, and why, i.e., that
                    FS children's education was of benefit rather thaan adverse experience) How did
                    you get started, how were you led to that premise?</p>
                <p>MORIN: I had been teaching, as you know, at every post I was at, usually for the
                    Army. We came into the Service in 1948 and we had a two-year-olat the time.
                    While in Paris and Algiers and Le Havre, education was not supported by the
                    Foreign Service; you paid your own child's education. This went on until 1955,
                    when they changed the rules. You see, the Foreign Service Act of 1946 changed
                    the Service's premise — people were then brought in from all walks of life, but
                    the act did not provide benefits to enable the new people to support this kind
                    of life, and one of the things was that you had to support your children's
                    education; and your own travel — the wife's travel if she had to leave the post
                    for any reason at all — which also happened to me — for health reasons, or the
                    birth of a child. You had to pay.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>I taught overseas for the Army, but my child was not eligible for the Army
                    school. We couldn't afford to send her to the American School in Paris, nor
                    could many of the American FS people who lived in Paris. It was a very expensive
                    school, and those of us who were embassy people couldn't afford to send our
                    children there. When we went to Japan, we did pay to have our child go to the
                    Canadian Academy, a private school, because we were not eligible to enroll them
                    in the American Army school. Anyway, I had majored in English, had taught it,
                    and was always interested in education, particularly after my children were
                    born, so it seemed a natural thing to get into. As you know, early in his
                    career, an FSO is transferred much oftener than when he has a senior position,
                    and I saw my daughter, the oldest child, buffeted about, a new school all the
                    time. It began to be apparent that this would affect her social development; she
                    became very shy. She would have been somewhat shy anyway but I think this added
                    to it, and I was very interested in what this was doing to her.</p>
                <p>By the time she finished high school, she had been in 12 different schools, in
                    three different languages. That's difficult for a child, and I was very
                    concerned about her. She learned to read French long before she learned to read
                    English — she taught herself English. So I worried about her. Then my husband,
                    while at Yale, became very ill and it was feared he had a cancer. He did not,
                    thank goodness. But it scared me so, I thought, with only a bachelors' degree
                    and two children to support, I had better make certain I was employable.</p>
                <p>We decided that when we were transferred to Washington I would get a master's
                    degree; which I did, at night — it took three years to do it that way. For my
                    thesis I decided to work out something that would be helpful to my own
                    situation. I was very lucky, because the advisers at the University of Maryland
                    were very interested in the fact that I was a Foreign Service wife and in what I
                    was trying to do. At the same time, it looked as though my husband would be in
                    the Near East/African division from then on (which is what happened) and I
                    thought, “Here is a place where I am probably going to have to have a hand in
                    running the schools.” The University let me tailor my curriculum to suit myself.
                    They let me take any course I thought would help me to run a school, and they
                    certainly encouraged me in my thesis. This is how I got into it.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Then I went to do some research on FS children.At that time, there was a man
                    called Clark Slade, who was as obstructive as he could possibly be. [He was the
                    Department's education counselor — a new position.] He didn't want me doing it —
                    it was something he should have done, of course, but I was determined to do the
                    study. A woman named Margaret O'Neill, whose husband was in the Service, had
                    writtea term paper on FS children. I heard about it and went to see her, and she
                    gave me some very valuable tips as to how I could get some names of FS children.
                    She knew that American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) had a list of names,
                    and using that — not through the Foreign Service itself, because I was totally
                    blocked there — I went ahead and got the names. Then I went to Montgomery and
                    Prince George's County headquarters and got permission to go into the public
                    schools that reflected the same socio-economic background as the FS children,
                    and ask those children questions also.So that's what I did. Of course, the
                    parents helped me to write the questions. This was strictly a Foreign Service
                    project, and I was delighted with the results. As it says in my paper, all
                    children have problems, and besides that, FS children have other ones.</p>
                <p>My conclusion was that Foreign Service children, although subjected to additional
                    pressures and strains, would make out all right if their parents raised them in
                    a warm, caring atmosphere, with discipline and love, and that the Foreign
                    Service life, with its isolation from the U.S. could, in fact, foster strong
                    nuclear families. Thus the title of an article I wrote on the subject for the
                    Foreign Service Journal: “Stop Feeling Sorry for Your Children”.</p>
                <p>Now, I think much of the thesis (The Academic Progress and Social Development of
                    Foreign Service Children) is probably still valid, but there are many changes
                    too. In those days, we did not have the drug problems, the alcohol problems;
                    things are very different now. I think basically it's certainly valid that if
                    both parents give their child one-on-one attention, that child will come out all
                    right in the long run.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think it would be very valid if someone were to look at it today and
                    say, “Maybe we should be looking at some of these values.” (She suggests the

                <p>MORIN: At all of our posts, housing was very, very scarce. When we arrived in
                    Kobe, I had two little children and didn't know where we were going to live;
                    nothing seemed to be available. During our tour there, they began building a
                    compound. But the Admin officer's wife was friendly with a Japanese woman and
                    knew that this very wealthy Japanese widow lived in a mansion and rented out
                    part of it — one wing of the mansion was four storeys high and four storeys into
                    the ground: her husband had survived the great earthquake of 1923, so had built
                    the house of reenforced steel. Whatever typhoon, earthquake, etc. we had never
                    shook that house.</p>
                <p>The administrative officer's wife asked if we'd mind living with a Japanese
                    family, and we said, “No, any place to get out of a hotel with a two-year-old
                    child.” Shortly after, we were invited to tea at the home of this very proper
                    Japanese lady, a delightful woman. She had grown children. I was not aware what
                    was happening, but I was being vetted. A few days later the Admin officer's wife
                    told me, “You've got a house.” “Really?” “Yes. Mrs. Kodera has watched your
                    children and has decided they're very well-behaved, and you can live with them.”
                    So we had one wing, with a common entryway. (She describes the space they
                    occupied and the screen that separated their part from the Japanese family's
                    Buddhist shrine room. The rest of the house was California Mission-style and had
                    been furnished by Sloane's in New York, who had sent out models, and then the
                    actual furniture, after studying plans of the house which had been sent to
                    them.)</p>
                <p>We had the side garden, which had seven terraces. On our side was a hillock which
                    was a Japanese burial mound, landscaped, where you could walk up and sit among
                    the trees.A stream wound down it into a large carp pool. We had two terraces:
                    they had the rest. It was an extraordinary experience. We soon got involved with
                    the family, including the son's arranged marriage ceremony. As each episode of
                    the courtship happened — they had go-betweens, of course — our hostess kept us
                    apprised of the progress. Then when the wedding was planned, a truck drove up
                    one day and all this furniture, trunks and wardrobes were offloaded and all
                    displayed in the Japanese shrine room. It was the bride's dowry. Among the dowry
                    were some very charming things — little lacquer boxes that held her diplomas.
                    They weren't what we'd expect. They were diplomas in tea ceremony, in
                    doll-making, in Japanese fan-dancing, and that sort of things, to show she was a
                    “proper wife.” She was also well educated and those diplomas were there, too.

                        was coup and...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>MORIN: Mind you, this was the second coup, and it was on November 13, 1963. She
                    was at school. The coup began with an airplane strafing Camp Rachid, right
                    across the street from the school, trying to knock out tanks. A father came to
                    school with a couple of taxis, packed the children in, and away they went. My
                    daughter had run in to get her coat, and they drove off without her. The school
                    was located in the YWCA, which was on the edge of town, near this Army camp.
                    Baghdad is bisected by the Tigris River, and she was on the outskirts of the
                    side where the embassy is and where our home was. So, theoretically, she could
                    probably have walked it in 30 minutes. But the Army was all around, streets were
                    barricaded, Iraqis were fighting Iraqis, the national guard fighting the army.
                    All hell was breaking loose.</p>
                <p>So she left the school and started walking. A taxi came by. She signaled madly
                    and he stopped. I should explain, now, that at this time it was very dangerous
                    for a young girl to be out on the street alone, especially in wartime. She had
                    the kind of looks that Iraqis go for — she's very, very dark but with very white
                    skin, and big brown eyes. She was only 16 an(laughing) a rather toothsome little
                    morsel. That never occurred to her. Well, the taxi driver picked her up and
                    asked where she wanted to go. She didn't speak much Arabic and all she could
                    think of was (in Arabic) “American embassy.” He tried to get there. Every street
                    he tried was blocked, and he began to be afraid for his taxi because the
                    national guard were confiscating taxis — they were losing the battle and they
                    wanted to flee the city. So he zoomed out of town, way downriver, to his native
                    village, hid his taxi, and took her in to his womenfolk. They sat her on a big
                    pile of goatskin rugs and plied her with yogurt from a goatskin bottle. She said
                    she was very grateful to them for being so kind to her but she wasn't used to
                    yogurt and it sort of upset her stomach. So she reached in her bag and — I hate
                    to say it: she smoked — pulled out a cigarette. The man vanished, and after a
                    while he returned — with a package of American cigarettes. They cost a mint in
                    Baghdad. He'd gone around to find her a package of her kind of cigarettes.</p>
                <p>They gave her tea, she drank that. The women would try to talk to her, they would
                    examine her clothing and everything, and she would try to respond — a terrible
                    communication problem. After a while the taxi driver came back, beckoned her to
                    follow him down to the riverfront. When I think of the naivet� with which she
                    followed this TOTAL STRANGER! (both laugh) So they went down to the riverfront
                    and two of his friends were in this long native boat, to cross the river below
                    the city. The two men began to ogle her, which she began to feel and became very
                    uneasy. Her protector spoke very sharply to them and they desisted. Then, when
                    they came ashore, he — apparently having some authority in the village — told
                    them to go back. And he and my daughter began, the two of them, walking back to
                    the city, from way below it.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>A pack of wild dogs came after them — the city is full opacks of wild dogs, you
                    know — so that really frightened her. He broke off a palm branch and trailed it
                    behind him in the dust, rattling it back and forth. That noise scared the dogs.
                    That's something useful to know, Jewell! (both laugh) Well, he got her back into
                    the city, and he went to a friend's house, and that friend had a taxi, this
                    being on the other side of the river. And with her in the back, the two men
                    looked inquiringly at her as to where to go. She told them “American Library.”
                    Incidentally, the bridges were all closed, no way to get across on them. And the
                    library was on the other side!They tried to but couldn't get anywhere near it.
                    Then she recognized where she was and began directing them. They ended up at the
                    home of some friends of ours who lived several streets behind the library.</p>
                <p>They let her off, rang the bell, and my friend's cook came out, and my daughter
                    asked him if he would pay the taxi driver — she didn't have any money. The cook
                    asked the taxi driver how much was it. This is the better part of a day that
                    this man has been taking care of this child. He said, “One dinar,” which was
                    about one [British] pound. He was given his dinar and away he went. My friend,
                    coming downstairs, said, “Andy, how did you get here?” And Andy told her. My
                    friend exclaimed, “And we let him go with only one pound? I would have paid him
                    any amount.”</p>
                <p>The ironical part of this story is that my husband was the warden for the embassy
                    in times of coups and revolutions. He had a little map and walkie-talkies and so
                    forth, and he had located every single American citizen except his own daughter.
                    It wasn't until late that afternoon that somebody, going around checking on that
                    particular family, discovered that she was at our friends' house. “How in the
                    world,” he asked “did you get here?” “Oh,” she said, “I took a taxi, and I rode
                    in a boat, and I walked.” That's all it was to her. Our hair stood on end,
                    because girls did still vanish.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, that's a true Foreign Service story. To move to Algiers, you were there
                    when we walked on the moon and also during the anti-U.S. feeling, which must
                    have been fostered by Eldridge Cleaver, right?</p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes, well, it didn't help. We were there two times — for our first post,
                    and then 20 years later we went back. The first time it was part of the French
                    Metropole, it was a consulate general.This was before the war for independence.
                    Then when we returned in 1968, Algeria was an independent country and we were an
                    embassy, but the '67 War had just occurred and we no longer had an embassy — no
                    longer had an ambassador — but there was an interest section.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MORIN: I know what you mean because Lonnie was charg� when Lew was away. Well,
                    there was an awful lot of anti-American feeling at the time because of the '67
                    War. I have to say that it was not helped by Eldridge Cleaver. You see, there
                    was a Pan-African conference held in Algiers of all the different African
                    countries and a great many blacks came to Algeria. Among those who came from
                    America were Stokely Carmichael and Eldridge Cleaver, if you remember, had
                    jumped bail — hijacked an airplane and escaped through Cuba to Algiers. He and
                    Stokely Carmichael were in two different camps; they wouldn't speak to each
                    other. One was at the Aletti Hotel, one at the St. George Hotel. It was “Down
                    with the U.S.” and “They're terrible to us blacks” and so on. Signs began to
                    appear around the city showing black slaves in chains and nasty slogans about
                    the U.S. and the way they treated people.</p>
                <p>Now, you have to understand that in Algeria, blacks are really looked down on;
                    you will never find a black in any position of power. But they were really very
                    virulently anti-U.S., and this emotion was fanned by Cleaver and Carmichael.
                    Although I have to say that Cleaver came to our Thanksgiving Party with all his
                    friend(she laughs). (brief discussion to compare notes on whom the two men were
                    married to) One of the people in the entourage had a little baby. It wasn't
                    getting proper care — these were very young, almost “hippy” types — and the
                    embassy took care of it, and got it back to the U.S. — the grandparents sent the
                    money, our consul got the Air France stewardess to take it to Paris, another one
                    took it to New York. So, I mean, “Down with the U.S. but we'll use the embassy
                    whenever we need it.” I thought that was very interesting.</p>
                <p>It happened that at this point Lonnie was charg�. Very early one morning, maybe 6
                    o'clock, still in bed, he got a phone call. He told me that the Algerian chief
                    of protocol had called. It seemed that their Algerian ambassador to the UN, a
                    young man who had just been married, had been on his honeymoon down on one of
                    the Caribbean islands, and while swimming in the surf had accidentally broken
                    his neck. He had been flown back to New York, and been treated by the finest
                    neurosurgeon, but was in a permanent coma. Nothing more could be done for him.
                    He'd been in treatment for about a month by then.Well, they wanted to get him
                    back to Algiers but of course couldn't send him commercially. They also wanted
                    to get his brand-new wife and his parents who were there and his entourage and
                    the furniture. Now they were calling us — mind you, this was at the height of
                    anti-American feeling — to ask us if we would put at their disposal a medevac
                    plane because the Russians had offered one and they didn't want to accept the
                    Russians'. The Russians, you see, were trying to infiltrate — they had a lot of
                    people there but the Algerians didn't like them much. This was all sort of
                    hush-hush because they wanted to be able to say to the Russians, “Thank you but
                    we already have something.” So Lonnie got in touch with the State Department,
                    who got in touch with Defense, who agreed to do it. There was a plane coming to
                    Frankfurt anyway, so they just diverted it slightly.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Now, this was a very important man. Lonnie and the political officer went out to
                    the airport, as did the Algerian chief of protocol, the foreign minister, and a
                    whole lot of people, to see the plane come in. There had been no military planes
                    at all, and indeed, no American planes because TWA had lost its air rights after
                    the '67 War. Well, you know, after you've lived in a country for a while and
                    everywhere you go you see signs damning your country, you get to feeling very
                    defensive about it. And the American flag you're proud of. Well, they were
                    standing out there and out of the sky came this enormous plane, the kind that
                    has floppy wings, an enormous plane. As it came closer, you could see “USA” and
                    the big U.S. markings on it. My husband and the political officer had a real
                    frisson, you know — “We are coming to their rescue.” And down came the might of
                    the United States, and it settled just like a bird. The crew threw open the
                    doors and out came the captain. He stood at the top, looked around a bit, then
                    began to descend. He was a gorgeous man, a big strapping American, black as the
                    ace of spades! (both laugh heartily) It was marvelous! We wondered — had the
                    Defense Department done it on purpose? (laughter again) They hadn't, you know.
                    It couldn't have been better — well, the Algerians stood there gaping. These are
                    the people coming who are so horrible to their blacks, and here was this black
                    in command of a plane, and there was no question he was in charge. The Algerians
                    had laid on cars to take them all through the town — they were thanking them,
                    you see. And the captain said no, no, he had his schedule, he had to go. But he
                    did stay for a little luncheon and then he took his people back. And everybody
                    poured back onto the tarmac again, and the plane just lifted up. This was a
                    STOL, Short Takeoff and Landing, designed to use a very short runway. And off it
                    went until it was a little speck in the air. But I tell you: what it did for our
                    morale! It was just wonderful.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your role in all of this? You've said a couple of times this morning,
                    perhaps unaware of it, “Of course, I volunteered because I'm a Foreign Service
                    wife.” And that's what you were doing.</p>
                <p>MORIN: Sure. Sure. But I was paid as a teacher. But when I was talking about the
                    volunteer and the FS wife, I meant such things as at my first assignment when,
                    because I spoke French and the consul general's wife didn't, I did her Christmas
                    shopping for her. I wrapped the Christmas presents for her. And you know how
                    many, many times we had to provide all the cookies and sandwiches and things.
                    And we had to be there on tap to help set things up, and afterwards to help
                    clean up. That's what I'm talking about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you accept that as part of being a Foreign Service
                        wife? Odid it grate a little bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>MORIN: Oh, it grated a great deal. But there was nothing I could do about it. So
                    I accepted with as good grace as I could. But it didn't seem right. And I know
                    that when I, finally, came into a position of supposedly having authority over
                    somebody else, I never would do it. I would ask people “Would you be willing?”
                    “Would you be so good as to?” And it happened that I had to fly to Germany to
                    have surgery on a foot, which I had broken, and I was quite hampered as to what
                    I could do for entertaining. I asked some of the wives and they very graciously
                    agreed to help me. But if they hadn't, that would have been all right too,
                    because you can't — I just don't expect people to have to do things like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But still, that was before '72.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: That was still '69 and '70. And don't forget, this was wheit was the thing
                    that you got two people for the price of one.</p>
                <p>Q: Do you have any idea where the two-for-the-price-of-one began? Among all the
                    older women that I've interviewed, it doesn't crop up anywhere. They just
                    accepted the role.</p>
                <p>MORIN: Maybe post-war?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably post-Wristonization, do you suppose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Oh no, it was well before Wristonization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The concept of two-for-the-price-of-one was
                        beforWristonization, you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: I know it was. It was one of the first things I was tolwhen we arrived in
                    Algiers (1948).</p>
                <p>Q: When Gene Bovis and I were talking yesterday about the rise of individualism
                    and the larger societal context that he feels our project should be placed in to
                    make it relevant outside the Service, I said, “Do you think the
                    two-for-the-price-of-one concept began with Abigail Adams?” He said no, he felt
                    that she was just carrying out the traditional family values that existed at the
                    time in spite of the well over 100 years of the Hobbsian and Lockian theories. I
                    don't know if I agree with him entirely... She set the pace for all of us.</p>
                <p>MORIN: Well, you said that these other women did this and they didn't think
                    anything of it; but they still did it, you see. So it was two for the price of
                    one back then.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes but they didn't think of it in those terms.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Ah — but we were told, in so many words; as early as 1948. I remember when
                    our consul general met us the first night or so we were there; I remember his
                    saying, “Aha! Two for the price of one. This looks like it's going to be a good
                    bargain.” Something like that. Oh, yes. It was the first time it had dawned on
                    me. I didn't know, because I never had the chance to take any of the training at
                    the Institute.</p>
                <p>Q: I must quote you on that, “looks like it's going to be a good bargain.” I
                    think I might go back to some of the women I interviewed earlier and just ask
                    them on the telephone if they remember their participation in those terms.</p>
                <p>MORIN: You asked me did I resent any of this. What I did resent was the fact that
                    I was supposed to jettison my children whenever I was needed. There wasn't any
                    question that you stayed home because you had a child who was perhaps ill or
                    that you felt you ought to stay with a little bit, was out of sorts, or didn't
                    want you to go. There was no question about it: you went. I did resent that,
                    because I thought “we're getting our values all backwards here.” I think this
                    may be one of the reasons why I put so much of my energies into American
                    children overseas. I think I did.</p>
                <p>And don't forget: they don't have such an easy time of it. We set up our little
                    schools, but, for example, in Baghdad, a mob started to storm the school, you
                    had to evacuate the school; that type of thing. You have things happen that
                    aren't apt to happen in America. We had Aladdin stoves, one of them tipped over
                    and caught fire; we had to evacuate the school. One time I recall while I was a
                    teaching-principal in Baghdad: I wasn't in my classroom, I was in my office and
                    my secretary came to me and said, “Mrs. Morin, Mrs. Morin! There's a bunch of
                    Iraqi Air Force officers out here.” I said, “Well, show them in.” In they came
                    and the leading one was a colonel, there were some captains and I don't know
                    what-all. At this time — well, always the Iraqi army and air force are
                    paramount. (speaking as though to command) They are little gods. The colonel
                    said to me, “We are requisitioning this school and I want to look it over.” This
                    is right in the middle of a school day.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Being an American woman, it never occurred to me that you don't say this to an
                    Iraqi officer; and I said, “You'll just have to wait.” He said, “What do you
                    mean I have to wait?” I said, “I'm very sorry but my children are in their
                    classes now. They have had one scare after another and you are not about to
                    march through my classrooms and scare them again.” “Oh,” he said; and the other
                    men were looking shocked. I said, “Now, if you wouldn't mind, you can come into
                    the faculty room and I will give you floor plans of the school and we'll go over
                    it and you can look at it. Then when recess comes and the children are outside,
                    I wiltake you around.” (she laughs)They sat down for 15 or 20 minutes. I said to
                    them, “Just before the recess bill rings, I'll take you into the library.” I
                    didn't want the children to see them, because the children were very frightened
                    by all of these coups, you see. So I began walking them down the corridor to the
                    library. They were clomping along noisily in their boots, and again without
                    thinking I turned around and went, “Shhhh!” And all six of them shut right up
                    and they walked on tiptoe. Well, it struck me so funny that my shoulders were
                    shaking as I ushered them into the room and shut the door.</p>
                <p>Then the children left, and I showed the men around the school, and when the
                    children came back in I ushered them out the door. And when I told some of some
                    of the FSOs about this afterwards, they said, “Oh, Ann, you didn't! Oh my Lord,
                    you didn't do that?” And I said, “Yes, but I did it without thinking.” And it
                    worked. They recognize authority; even a woman. And of course we did lose the
                    school. After that we had to go across the river, closer to the embassy. We had
                    a beautiful embassy, with the ambassador's residence and staff housing; a lovely
                    place. It has been taken over by the Iraqis. It's right next to the presidential
                    palace, so when the palace was being strafed and bombed during one of our many
                    coups, so was the embassy.</p>
                <p>Q: What about your interest in archeology? And we haven't even touched on your
                    unerring eye for modern art. I guess the ruins were there. Is that part of the
                    Baghdad “assignment”?</p>
                <p>MORIN: For some people. You have to have an interest in history. But there are —
                    I believe the number is 25,000 abandoned ruins in Iraq. Many of them are in the
                    Diyala Valley which has been flooded since we were there. On Sundays, you would
                    get permission from some office, probably the Foreign Office, to go out to these
                    tells, as these mounds are called, and you could take anything that you found on
                    the surface. And because of the constant wind, every week something different
                    would come to light. We went to all the different tells and picked up these
                    various ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean, everything in that case over there you found on
                        thsurface?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But surely the ones that were shards you put back
                        together?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MORIN: We had to put back together, yes. The oldest piece is that canteen you see
                    at the left. Don Hansen of the Oriental Institute in New York City tells me that
                    that is 4,500 BC; 6,500 years old. Isn't that amazing? We have the provenances
                    of each piece because they come from different tells. That way, experts can date
                    them. Yes, we had to put them back together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that was an interest you developed there, wasn't it.
                        Yocouldn't help but!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Well no, a lot of people didn't, but it was a wonderful way to spend a
                    Sunday. You'd take a group of friends, you'd have a picnic. And then we'd meet
                    every so often and have little lectures. People would read up on a subject. I
                    remember mine was on cuneiform writing. (she laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then your interest in art: could we trace that back to
                        youconnection with the Wyeth family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Well, Andrew Wyeth is my first cousin. While we were growing up, every
                    Christmas Andy's father, N. C. Wyeth, would send us the book he had illustrated
                    that year. That was always exciting — to get Robin Hood, Black Beauty, Marjorie
                    Kinnan Rawlings' The Yearling, for example. It developed an interest in art in,
                    I guess, all of us cousins; we're a rather large family. Several are artists.
                    This gift does not come only from the Wyeth side, because some of my other
                    cousins are very fine artists too. But that family, of course, is a very unusual
                    family. One of the [Wyeth] sisters, my cousin Ann — we were named for our
                    grandmother, by the way — had her debut, as a pianist, with the Philadelphia
                    Philharmonic Orchestra under Stokowski when she was 18 years old. And when her
                    father died, she wrote a requiem which was played by the Philadelphia
                    [Orchestra]. And, of course, in the summer we would spend time with the cousins
                    at their place up in Maine.</p>
                <p>But this developed an interest — I remember the first thing my husband gave me
                    when we were in Algiers was a beautiful, very large book of the Impressionists.
                    You know, those wonderful French art books, with terrific reproductions, each
                    one worthy of framing. I never did, and I still have the book. He said, “This is
                    to help you fill in the hours between house-hunting,” because it was to take us
                    three months to find a place to live. We became very interested in art. So as
                    that developed and grew, as we went to different countries — in Japan, I can
                    understand why the Japanese had such a terrific impact on the French
                    Impressionists, because going there was an eye-opener to us, too. We were very
                    fascinated with Japanese art in all forms — their dancing, singing, puppeteers,
                    etc. It's a very formalized, stylized art but very beautiful. And then we seemed
                    to become more and more avant-garde, I guess you'd say, so we end up with this
                    eclectic collection. That has extended to bits and pieces of statues, too.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting how nicely you've brought it all together
                        here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Thank you, I appreciate that. I had a decorator who came in here once. He
                    was putting up some curtains for me. He looked around and said, “Absolutely
                    nothing goes with anything — but it all looks very nice together.” (both laugh
                    heartily, and agree neither of them can stand a “decorator house.”)</p>
                <p>Q: Is there anything else that I've missed? I've tried to hit all of your high
                    points. Now, you gave me nothing between 1964 and '68. Were you in Washington
                    during those years?</p>
                <p>MORIN: 1964-68: that's when I was Director of Admissions at the International
                    Center for Language Studies, in Washington. I only gave you the overseas posts —
                    I'm sorry. 1970-74 was Washington too. That's when I was in the travel agency.
                    It was interesting because I was part owner of a travel agency at the same time
                    Lonnie was a Foreign Service Inspector. And as you know, the Service doesn't pay
                    for the wife on his trips. So it was a useful combinatiobecause I managed to get
                    in a couple of trips through my own business, because I could do some scouting
                    for restaurants and hotels while he was inspecting.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORIN: There's just one little thing I'd like to add, if I may, and that is — I
                    think this will explain the differences between when we started and now — when
                    we set out for our first post, which was Algiers in 1948, we were supposed to
                    take one of the new Four Aces [ocean liners]. We were to be on the maiden voyage
                    of the Exchordia in the fall of 1948. The ship wasn't finished in time. The
                    Department said, “You must get out there; we simply have to have you out there.”
                    I don't know wh(laughing) but anyway they had to have a person. So they put us
                    on a Norwegian tramp steamer called the Estrella. It was a motor ship, not a
                    steamship. It had two motors, and it was about 5,000 tons; a very small ship. My
                    husband had been in the Navy, and when we arrived at the pier in New York, he
                    looked down at this boat, and said, “I spent two years in the Navy and I never
                    had to walk down to get to a ship.”</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>On descending we found we were to be in the ship's sick bay, which was one room
                    with two cabins, and there were three of us. I had been told what to take to the
                    post — new evening gowns — and I thought this was going to be a lovely trip:
                    music and dining and so forth. Well, we had to pull out slacks and a few shirts
                    and tops to take the trip. The rest went down in the hold. And for 30 days we
                    rode on that ship to get to our post. We hit a hurricane, it knocked out one of
                    the motors, and for three days we just rocked. The water poured through the
                    portholes. My husband and my daughter were so sick — they didn't have Dramamine
                    then. We ate canned everything because they ran out of fresh food after a week.
                    (laughing) By the time we got to Algiers, Lonnie, who should have been there two
                    and a half weeks earlier, was the watch officer who was supposed to meet
                    himself! Fortunately, the Exec noticed that they'd forgotten to change the watch
                    list and he came down and met us at the boat. After that, (she laughs again) I
                    think I was pretty well inured, you know. That was a very good way to start out
                    because ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well but you sound like you've been a good sport
                        throughout iall, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: I'd like to think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that counts for a lot, really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: As long as things can make me laugh. That was quite a trip because we had
                    no fresh water on board, except to drink, so we had to bathe in salt water, and
                    had to wash the baby's diapers in salt water. We would string them up on the
                    captain's bridge and they would get like boards. I remember we were coming into
                    Oran and the Captain came to us and said, “Would you take the diapers down? It
                    doesn't look right.” (great laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have to keep your sense of humor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Oh, you absolutely have to, yes. It's a very rich life. It's a very good
                    life. And the thing is, youmeet such nice people. Fascinating people.</p>
                <p>How did my husband go into the Foreign Service? He was in the Navy, and was a
                    naval officer in the Amphibious Corps. He was in four invasions. After that was
                    over — he came through without a scratch — he didn't know what he wanted to do,
                    but he knew he wanted to travel. And his father was prominent in New Hampshire
                    politics, and he said, “Styles Bridges is a friend of mine. Go down and talk to
                    Styles Bridges.”</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>So Lonnie came down to Washington and talked to Styles Bridges or his assistant,
                    and the assistant said, “Go on over and talk to Jack Peurifoy at the State
                    Department.” So Lonnie had an appointment and went over there. He had heard
                    about the ECA [European aid] program: he thought he would really like to be an
                    ECA officer overseas. That would allow him to travel.</p>
                <p>We knew nothing about the Foreign Service. So, over he went. And Peurifoy said,
                    “Oh, you don't want to be in ECA, that's too temporary. There won't be any 'aid'
                    after five or six years.” (she laughs) “You want a permanent career. I would say
                    to you, go take the Foreign Service exam, but you have a wife and baby, you
                    can't afford to sit around and wait, you've got to support them. So join the
                    staff corps. So Lonnie said, “Fine.”</p>
                <p>He was put through the FSI course. He had the A-100 course and all that sort of
                    thing.He was, I think, the only FSin that group of FSOs. And he went out. He was
                    going to take the FS exam. Well, the first two years he was too busy getting
                    himself acclimated. And then, the next year he was going to take it, and our
                    child died. That just knocked the slats out from under us. So he canceled his
                    application or whatever you did, and he didn't do it. It wasn't until l953 — and
                    we'd entered in '48 — that he actually sat down and took the exams. They took
                    three days back then.In Paris. And he passed it. I remember — I think it was New
                    Year's Eve we got word that he had passed it and was being sent back to
                    Washington to take the orals. Well, he got back to Washington and he was to
                    transfer with somebody in Kobe, Japan, who had done the same thing. They were
                    going to swap jobs. The other fellow was fine, he went back, took his orals,
                    passed, went on to Le Havre. Lonnie went back and they said, “Well, we're
                    terribly sorry but we have lost your security papers.” (They'd been misplaced,
                    they weren't lost.) “And so we haven't done the field security clearance on you;
                    you will have to wait. It will probably take six months. You can live in
                    Washington on TDY; or you can go to Kobe.”</p>
                <p>He came back and said to me, “What do I do?” “Well,” I said, “I think you go to
                    Kobe.” I'd always wanted to go to the Orient. My grandmother had been in China
                    in the 1920s with her son who was in the Navy. They always had a tour in the
                    Orient, you know, in those days, after Annapolis. And so we went off to
                    Japan.</p>
                <p>Well, come spring, the Wriston program started. Lonnie couldn't take his orals,
                    there was nobody to give them to him until the Wriston program was just about
                    over. It wasn't until l95(laughing) that he finally took the orals and got in.
                    In the meantime, just about everybody in the consulate had become FSOs except
                    us. We were the only one who passed the exam. Now, that is a very revealing
                    statement; I say “we” because I can remember sitting there with books, with
                    Bartlett's [Familiar] Quotations, with atlases and so forth, helping him prepare
                    for the exam.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Right after he became an FSO, that's when the Inspectors thought he should have
                    advanced training, and that's why we were sent back from Japan to Yale. But the
                    comment I was making was that I resented this, the fact that he had to wait, a
                    lot more than he did. He's a very, very steady, even-tempered individual. And
                    the reason I resented it is that so much of me was wrapped up in his career,
                    because it had to be. And I had to keep stopping my career. Therefore, all of my
                    eggs were in his basket. And if it was something that was reflecting on him, it
                    reflected on me. And I was very cross about it, I really was. Plus the fact that
                    one had to do all of these things which one didn't necessarily want to do — you
                    know, ladies' clubs and that sort of thing. I'm not much of a ladies clubber,
                    although you can meet some very lovely people. I usually prefer to do something
                    more in the education line or lecturing or something like that.</p>
                <p>Q: So he was in the Service for almost 31 years, from '48 until '79, and went out
                    as an FSO for the first time in 1960, so that was twelve years.</p>
                <p>MORIN: He was a staff officer for eight years — 1948-1956. The Wriston program
                    delayed his transition to FSO for two years after he passed the written
                    exams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. So you saw Algiers, Le Havre, Paris and Kobe from a
                        stafofficer's wife's point of view.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Except, I don't know, when we first entered the Service in Algiers I
                    remember there was another couple there. He was a staff officer, and to be
                    perfectly honest with you, I never knew that there were two kinds. I never knew
                    until this woman told me, and we had been in Algiers several weeks by the time
                    they arrived. She said, “You watch, the FSOs aren't going to treat you well.” I
                    never was treated as anything but exactly as one of them. I never had the
                    slightest problem with that anywhere. But she said, “Oh, they are going to snub
                    you, and this and that.” Well, I think, as with so many of these things, it all
                    goes back to the individual, how well you get along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's how you perceive yourself. If you perceive yourself
                        as doormat, people are going to use you as one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: I know that that couple was not popular in Algiers. She would say it was
                    because he was a staff officer. I would say it was because they were pains in
                    the neck. They did sneaky little things, like — housing was very, very difficult
                    there, and it was the custom that when you arrived you were next in line for any
                    house that opened up. We had a little child, they didn't have any children, and
                    we were to get a house that was about to open up, after three months. Darned if
                    they didn't go to the landlord behind our backs, give him some key money, and
                    took the house, and they wondered why they were not popular?</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no! If they were after you they hadn't been in the
                        hotel along as you, and they didn't have children. How shocking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: It's water over the dam, it's something to laugh about now. But, it just
                    shows you. So I don't think that this staff and non-staff... There were and
                    there are some very snobbish Foreign Service officer types, there is no question
                    about it, and the wives are worse than the men.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, see, that's because they had no identity of their own. Everything, as
                    you said, you had all your eggs in your husband's basket. And they were
                    powerless in a way, really. And to a certain extent they still must be.</p>
                <p>MORIN: Now they must feel even worse because they see so many othewives who are
                    working.</p>
                <p>(Fenzi relates situation mentioned by Gene Bovis of two Smith graduates at same
                    post; one, the DCM's wife was unhappy, felt that she was wasting her expensive
                    education; the other woman, a lower ranking FSO with dependent spouse, was
                    content.)</p>
                <p>Q: The DCM's wife felt that the woman officer had it all and she, the wife, had
                    nothing. In a way, she was right, because she was working for no income. Well,
                    people still curry favor with the DCM's wife, because the DCM is going to write
                    [or comment on] their efficiency report, but they are not currying favor with
                    her because she is who she is. It's because of his job. And she was very
                    unhappy.</p>
                <p>MORIN: You used to see very miserable people in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I certainly did, but my experience was that most of the unhappy ones
                    were — perhaps it was just my experience — foreign born spouses.</p>
                <p>MORIN: They didn't belong anywhere.</p>

                <p>MORIN: You can imagine how defensive she must have been. (Discussion of
                    activities of the unhappy spouse.) To me, the Foreign Service is all about
                    people. You are representing your country overseas, and the only way you can do
                    it is with other people. Therefore, you'd better like people. If you do, then
                    you will enjoy it. Because entertaining is a lot of work. It's a lot of work,
                    especially if, as nowadays, you don't have the servants that people used to
                    have, and you have to do all the cooking. It's a lot of effort. Of course, men
                    are helping a lot more now.</p>

                <p>(Discussion of interview techniques.)</p>
                <p>MORIN: There are tremendous changes which have taken place in the lives of
                    families in the Foreign Service. One of the things is housing. Because the
                    Department is now buying a lot more housing around the world. They're also
                    putting up compounds. We used to drag our own things around and they would be
                    broken, or sunk in the Gulf of Aden, or you'd lose your silverware — this, that
                    and the other thing — because we went by ship. The stuff doesn't go by ship any
                    more, it's all at the post. You fly and you take your few things. But a wife had
                    to spend so much time just finding a house, tramping the streets, knocking on
                    doors. I was offered a house in Algiers once — or I tried to get a house in
                    Algiers once — I just knocked door-to-door. It was the house of the local
                    executioner and the guillotine was in the cellar. Another house that I found,
                    which we didn't get, I thought was very strange; there was a bidet in every
                    room. It had been a whorehouse. This is the kind of stuff we were up against
                    right after the War in places like that. Le Havre had been completely bombed,
                    you know. You don't have to spend your time doing that any more. The embassy
                    takes care of it.</p>
                <p>Narrator's addendum:The pressure to find a house was intense because the
                    temporary quarters allowance lasted 90 days, and the regular housing allowance
                    that then kicked in would not begin to cover the cost of the hotel room. (My
                    husband's salary as an FSS-11 was $3,200 per annum.) There was no allowance for
                    meals and other expenses, which reminds me of an amusing anecdote. It very
                    quickly became apparent we could not afford the price of meals in the hotel
                    dining room. However, having a small child precluded our searching out cheaper
                    restaurants because evening meals in downtown establishments were served at an
                    hour when she would be in bed. Nor could we leave her alone in the hotel room.
                    Her meals were prepared on a hot plate balanced on an ornate heater installed in
                    the fireplace opening.</p>
                <p>We hit upon the solution of ordering sandwiches from room service. This went on
                    for several days and then Robert, our waiter, made a suggestion: “Why don't you
                    order one menu fixe? It won't cost any more, and you'll get more food.” So from
                    then on, each evening at a set time, Robert knocked on the door and waited for
                    one of us to call “Entrez!” Then the door would fly open, and in he would
                    rattle, pushing an enormous room service cart. On it would be two sets of
                    gleaming napery, sparkling crystal and dishes, and shining cutlery. He would set
                    the table impeccably and then, as if he were pulling a rabbit out of a top hat,
                    he would lift one of the silver covers keeping the food warm and demand, “Who
                    gets the soup tonight?” And, taking turns, we two would savor our main meal of
                    the day as we ate our way through one French diner. Incidentally, our daughter's
                    first word spoken in French as “Entrez!”</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Just days before our deadline, we found a house in the suburbs of El Biar. It had
                    been requisitioned by the French military for five years and was in deplorable
                    condition, with broken bath fixtures, dangling wires, gouged plaster walls,
                    drooping wallpaper. The landlord was so depressed by it he wanted to sell it for
                    what he could get. An officer at the consulate persuaded him to meet us so we
                    could plead our case in person. Five minutes into the interview, the landlord
                    and his wife, after initially refusing, suddenly changed their minds and said we
                    could have the place. So we moved in, and with weekend help from office
                    colleagues (rather like a New England barn raising), we put the place in order
                    and made it livable.</p>
                <p>The landlord and his wife were very helpful; they even let me use their telephone
                    from time to time. (Telephones were greatly prized in post-war Algeria. It was
                    impossible to get one for ourselves because the antiquated system couldn't
                    handle any more lines.) Much later the landlord confided to me why she and her
                    husband had so suddenly changed their minds about renting to us. She said they
                    couldn't bear to refuse shelter to our little girl, because she looked so much
                    like their own daughter, who had died when she was two years old.End

                <p>Another thing is transportation. We used to have those “leisurely trips” — I told
                    you about that funny one on the Estrella — but I have had some very lovely trips
                    where there was a playroom for the children and all the rest of it. It was a
                    chance to unwind, and a chance to get yourself psyched up for the next post.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Now, of course, you just fly and you're there before you leave,
                    practically. Another thing: the education of children is much better. Children's
                    education is paid for and it doesn't make any difference where it is. Once that
                    was permitted, that you could have [paid for] education, that was sort of a
                    left-handed gift. I remember in Kobe you could only have the allowance if you
                    sent your child to the Army school, which we had been forbidden to do before. So
                    you were supposed to pull your child out and put it there. In the event, we had
                    to weigh very carefully as to what we wanted to do, and we decided on the Army
                    school because of the buses. Kobe is a very steep city and the buses that went
                    up and down to the American Academy didn't always have good brakes; and I'd
                    worried so one year that I really couldn't go through it another. Now that's not
                    the way to pick your child's education, but it sometimes comes down to that; and
                    you have to put the child's life first. Another thing that is very important is
                    the way stress and danger are taken care of. When we had stresses, there was
                    nobody who really cared.</p>

                <p>MORIN: Yes. Between '60 and '64, as I told you, we had three coups d'etat. We
                    weren't given, which I think is a wonderful thing now, a course before we went
                    out on how to handle stress. The ambassadors weren't educated in this. You just
                    went there and whatever happened was what happened.</p>
                <p>When I first started out, there weren't doctors at the post. Yes, there was a
                    doctor in Paris but the families couldn't use him at all. And therefore I was
                    thrown on the local medical economy, so to speak, and a terrible thing nearly
                    happened. You should remember, this was after I had lost a child and therefore,
                    perhaps, I was a much more nervous mother than I might otherwise have been. My
                    little baby had been crying a lot and holding his ear. Then that stopped but he
                    had sniffles a lot. I took him to an ear doctor in Chatou and the doctor said to
                    me, “Mrs. Morin, I must operate on this child.” Well the word “operation” sent
                    me into orbit, because the other child had died while in surgery. I said, “On my
                    child here? No, you won't. Use antibiotics.” “No, no,” he said, “I have to
                    operate, it will be mastoid. If you don't operate within 24 hours, I cannot
                    answer for the life of this child.”</p>
                <p>So I telephoned my husband and said, “What do I do?” He said, “Well, there is an
                    American-trained doctor in Paris. We'll call her up.” I called her up and she
                    asked the symptoms. I gave all of them to her, she said, “Don't do it. Bring in
                    the child to me” — this was a Friday — “on Monday.” So the doctor came around
                    that evening to the house, carrying a bag, and wanted to cut open my child's ear
                    and I wouldn't let him. He shook his head. “Oh, Madame, I can't answer, I can't
                    answer for your child's life.” What a frightening thing.</p>
                <p>Monday morning I took my child to the French woman doctor in Paris, who had
                    trained at Temple University, so therefore we had great faith in her. She looked
                    at him and said, “Which ear was it?” I asked, “What do you mean, which ear was
                    it?” She said, “Well, there's nothing wrong with either ear.” I said, “How could
                    this happen in the space of two days?” She had recommended medication that I'd
                    given him over the weekend. She said, “Mrs. Morin, I hate to tell you, but did
                    you happen to notice the date? It's the end of the month, he had to pay his
                    bills.” And she added, “I shouldn't say this but I'm afraid some of my fellow
                    doctors do unnecessary operation in order to do this sort of thing.” Isn't that
                    a shocker? If I hadn't been a frightened, trembling mother, they might have come
                    and punctured my child's ear. Who knows what would have happened later? He
                    probably would be deaf by now.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>That was the other thing, because medicine overseas was so far behind American
                    medicine. But you had very little recourse. It was the same way with dentistry.
                    One other thing that I was talking about: health care was a big problem. One of
                    the reasons why I did have surgery so many times was because in the States I had
                    to have “put back” what had been done wrong overseas. That is something that
                    wears you down, and it rather frightens you — not for yourself but for your
                    children. At least that was my case — you're so afraid something will happen —
                    heightened, of course, by the fact that I did lose a child. He was being
                    operated on for an inguinal hernia, which of course is very routine, just
                    nothing, usually; and he died on the table. Presumably because of the
                    anaesthetic. That was in Boston — we'd brought him back, you see, for that. And
                    then his brother was born a year later, and had the same problem. That was
                    pretty rugged. His surgery was done when he was six weeks old, in the States,
                    and because he was less than a year old, our insurance wouldn't cover it. It
                    took us twelve months to pay off the hospital and the doctor. That child is the
                    little brother whose ear the French doctor wanted to puncture and I wouldn't
                    have it.</p>
                <p>Then, in Paris at about the same time — I always remember because the doctor who
                    did it was a Dr. Chekhov — my daughter got an abscess in the glands under her
                    chin. The doctor came to the house and anesthetized her. I held her shoulders,
                    my husband held her feet while the doctor cut her open. And do you know, that
                    child was so frightened that she cried throughout the whole thing and you could
                    hear her down in the kitchen, but she was “out cold.” After the surgery we
                    applied boiled flax to “draw out” the puss.</p>
                <p>This kind of thing wouldn't happen now, but it did happen in the 50s. I remember
                    when I came back from Baghdad — because my house was shelled, I've got a piece
                    of a shell that I picked up aa souvenir piece at the time. There were three such
                    times in an eight-month period. We were in very grave danger then, we found out
                    later.</p>
                <p>I remember I came home to the U.S. in summer and was spending the time with my
                    father and mother in New Hampshire. It was the Fourth of July and all these
                    firecrackers started to go off. All of a sudden, with no apparent cause, I began
                    to cry. I'm not a crier. My husband said, “What is it? What is it?” I said,
                    “That noise! I can't bear it. It sounds like machine guns.” My father was in
                    World War I, in France, and he was shell-shocked. And he said to me, “That's
                    your problem, you're shell-shocked.” So I remember coming back to the
                    Department, having my physical before going out again and telling the doctor
                    that. He said, “I'm sure that's what it was. You had a mild case of shell-shock.
                    It's one thing to send soldiers into battle, or even officers, many of whom have
                    had military training, and it's another thing to send a wife with her children
                    into a place where this is going to happen.” It can be devastating to your
                    nerves.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Then when we were transferred to Algiers, the first week we were there, there was
                    an attempt on the life of Boumedienne, and I thought, “Oh no! Not again?” (she
                    laughs) But it wasn't, the fellow was apprehended, matters were all right. But
                    these are the things that are now looked out for. There wasn't anybody who knew
                    about these things or who cared. They have the terrible dangers now of kidnaping
                    and murder; which is awful. But after Qasim was killed in Baghdad, a manifesto
                    was found in his pocket — he knew there was going to be an uprising — and that
                    manifesto is reported to have said — something he was going to announce to the
                    fellaheen — “to rape, loot and murder, beginning with the Americans.”</p>
                <p>You know, in 1948, when they killed King Faisal, that's what happened — they did
                    kill some Europeans, you know. Fortunately, Qasim was killed. Do you know how he
                    was killed? They took him to the television station and they executed him with a
                    gun held to his temple before they turned on the TV camera. All day long we were
                    being told, “Tune in at six o'clock, tune in at six o'clock.” We didn't have
                    televisions, but the embassy did, and we all gathered around the TV. First of
                    all, there was a cartoon of Felix the Cat. I will always remember Felix the Cat.
                    When that finished, on came the leader, Abdul Karim Qasim, sitting up in a
                    chair, staring straight ahead. He had one eye that slouched and he tended to
                    stare anyway. We thought, “Oh, he hasn't been captured, here he is on TV.” And
                    then his head fell forward. A man grabbed his hair, turned his head this way so
                    you see the bullet wound right through here. The man was dead and they did it on
                    television. The reason they did it was because they didn't want the fellaheen to
                    say “He's still alive, he'll come back and lead us.” They wanted to show people
                    he really was dead. These are the things that sort of shattered my nerves after
                    a while. (she laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think so. That was in 1963. The children were
                        older bthen, at least.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Oh yes. But you know, it's a funny thing: while all those coups were going
                    on and we had to figure out where we could hide in case somebody stormed the
                    house — well, it turned out there really was no place to hide — my husband was
                    at the embassy, I was at the house alone, my daughter was lost at the school,
                    and my son had been taken to the embassy from his school. But after that, there
                    wasn't any school; everybody came home. We had curfews for several weeks. My
                    little boy soon became very used to the odd, sporadic machine gun fighting and
                    so forth. He'd be playing with his friends, and every time they heard the
                    machine guns they'd jump over the fence and hide, then they'd come back out
                    again. And they played ball right under the tanks that blocked our street at
                    each end. Children are marvelous, they're marvelous! But the parents were a bit
                    worried, you know.</p>
                <p>By the way, I used to have to stockpile the school with supplies — food, in case
                    we couldn't get the children out. We never had to use it but you had to be
                    prepared. Bandages and that sort of thing. The things that you don't have to
                    think of here, you know? It's curious.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORIN: It had its high points, but it exacted its tolls, psychic and physical.
                    The Service has come to recognize that these things do exist, that a man or
                    woman won't do a good job unless family is taken care of. We had to do an awful
                    lot of “coping” back then that is now taken care of by the blessed
                    administrative section. Can't say enough about them. They're wonderful,
                    wonderful. And it must be a thankless job, too, I would think. You can't ever
                    please everybody. I had one administrative officer tell me it's a job where you
                    know there are going to be at least 10 percent of the people who aren't happy,
                    no matter what you do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughing) I would think it would be higher than
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: I would, too. Now of course, foreign service people are given furniture,
                    allowances for the children's education, you're permitted to bring them out — we
                    had to pay to bring my daughter out, and I remember it cost $900. That was a lot
                    of money in those days. That's what my salary went for, of course. But you see,
                    the more you put into a thing, the dearer it is to you. And I think this
                    explains to you why I am doing this [the Women Ambassador's Project] for the
                    Foreign Service: I want people to know about the Foreign Service, I want
                    Americans to know about it. I want them to know that this isn't a bunch of
                    “cookie-pushers.” We earn our keep. And we certainly try to represent America
                    the very best we can.</p>
