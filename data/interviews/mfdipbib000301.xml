                <p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY JOSEPH F. DONELAN JR.</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 24, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Donelan, what attracted you toward the State
                        Department? In the first place could you give a little background about
                        yourself, your education and how you're concerned with foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: I was born in New York City, and, of course went to school there. I was
                    one of those depression kids; I came out of high school, managed to go to City
                    College of New York for one year, but then recognized that one must go to work.
                    My first job was in the New York office of Auchincloss, Parker &amp; Redpath,
                    whose headquarters was in Washington, DC The senior partner was Hugh D.
                    Auchincloss, stepfather of Jackie Kennedy, etc. The firm did a tremendous amount
                    of business with Latin American governments. As a matter of fact, it is not an
                    exaggeration to say that, at that time, circa 1936-37, Auchincloss had accounts
                    with most of the presidents of most of the Latin American countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of work were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: I started out as a runner, a messenger if you wish- carrying securities
                    all over the financial district; later moved into the “back office” which
                    handles funds and processing of sales of securities, and in the five years time
                    became pretty expert in the operation and administration of a securities firm.
                    We had one partner, who supervised most of the Latin American accounts, had
                    spent most of his early life in Latin America and of course was fluent in
                    Spanish. My language at the time was Spanish. I had studied it in high school
                    and that first year in college. I liked the language and had friends who were
                    native speakers. I was very fortunate working for this partner, did translations
                    for him, learned about estates and trusts, and investment documentation -
                    equities, foreign government bonds, etc. It was an exciting period for me and I
                    think that's what did it, just the idea of those countries, their finances,
                    trade balances and external debt, people, and problems which unfortunately are
                    even more serious today than they were then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you take an interest in geography, for example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Geography is inherently fascinating not because of where “x” is, but
                    because of people and cultures which geography introduces. While I was at
                    Auchincloss, I was still going toschool at night. So at night I was taking
                    economics and administration and I took a whole stream of subjects at City
                    College, which was great because you could take anything at night that you
                    wanted. I studied international law, shipping, maritime insurance, accounting,
                    and all that sort of thing. The combination of work and studies just whet my
                    appetite for international affairs, and then of course, I went off to the
                    Army.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: World War II.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: World War II. In the closing days I found myself sitting it out on
                    Okinawa. Plenty of time to contemplate while waiting to get a ship home, and the
                    question was “What am I going to do?” I'd cut my ties, really, with Wall Street.
                    What I discovered over time was that while I had marvelous training and good
                    experience, all the young men that came in from Princeton and Harvard, and Yale,
                    immediately sent out these big long lists to former classmates, and presto, they
                    became account executives.</p>
                <p>But anyway, this was the genesis of my interest in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I came back to the States in late 1945 and to Washington. My wife was working
                    here; I had two children at the time; and I got a job in what was then the Army
                    Air Force.(It didn't become the Department of the Air Force until 1947).</p>
                <p>I enrolled at Georgetown University, School of Foreign Service, and went to work
                    at the Pentagon as a management analyst and was there from '45 to 49'. The idea
                    was simple, make a living, finish school, and then get a job in the State
                    Department</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had this in mind the whole time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Yes, in effect, and I think it was generated principally by working with
                    Auchincloss, and my military service in the Pacific. They were like a glimpse
                    through a key-hole, of what's way out there, in terms of all the countries and
                    foreign affairs plus a sort of innate interest and curiosity about people and
                    things. You went to a new country. You met new people, you read everything you
                    could about the country and its culture, and hopefully you got to understand the
                    people and their country. I went over a couple of times to the old Walker
                    Johnson Building. Which then was, as you know, where the Department's personnel
                    office was. I really didn't know anyone, nor really what I might do in the
                    Foreign Service, so I talked to as many people as I could to find out what it
                    was all about. An Air Force Colonel returning from overseas was assigned to the
                    management office where I worked in the Pentagon. Henry Ford had been in the Air
                    Force mostly in administration and management. He was on his way to the State
                    Department. So it turned out, yes, I knew one person in the State Department
                    Then a Warrant Officer came in and was assigned to the office, a man by the name
                    of Kyle Mitchell. He was returning to his former employment in the State
                    Department</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He inspected me many years later.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>DONELAN: So now I knew two people in the State Department. But anyway, I had told
                    Henry of my interest, and as I said, had been over to see people and I'd
                    submitted applications. And essentially what happened in February 1949 or some
                    weeks before that, I had a call. Henry said: “How would you like to switch your
                    job and come over?” So I went over to the Department of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what was your first job? Where were you working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: First thing, I was assigned to what was called the Foreign Service
                    Planning Division. It had a section which was involved in budget planning,
                    formulation and execution. I started working on a combination of departmental
                    and foreign service budgets and my specific client was the Chinese Affairs
                    Division of the Office of Far Eastern Affairs. If you remember in '49 it was
                    rather exciting in China, so I had almost immediate fulfillment of my interest
                    and enough work for two people. In those days the system was, I believe, better
                    than it is today - more direct and fewer layers of people. The Budget Office was
                    part of the Foreign Service Planning Division and controlled post funding and
                    the local employee complements for all posts overseas. As the management analyst
                    I controlled the local employee complement for the Chinese posts and the funding
                    for the positions.</p>
                <p>I worked directly with the Chinese Affairs Division. Livingston Merchant, I
                    guess, was the chief at the time. But it was fascinating because I actually
                    wrote the budget in support of China affairs and talked to the chief for his
                    guidance, and other officers who were working intimately in these Asian and
                    China affairs and went over the draft budgets with them. It was much simpler and
                    straightforward in those days. Then when we went to OMB (Office of Management
                    and Budget), at that time called the Bureau of the Budget (Executive Office of
                    the President), to defend it, the senior officers would come along, but I was
                    always there. I was responsible. In the meantime, of course, I had been putting
                    together the justifications for staffing (Americans and Local) and post funding
                    for the next fiscal year. I then defended it internally in the Department's
                    Budget Office, and then the product went, of course, to BOB and then on to the
                    Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have just finished, about a month ago, sitting in on an
                        interview between Marshall Green and Philip Manhard, who was a vice consul
                        in Tsingtao. The situation was falling apart. You were dealing with a budget
                        situation where the broad picture was that the communist armies, the Red
                        Army, was coming and picking up. We had a number of posts there. We weren't
                        recognizing the Communists. They weren't recognizing us. Yet our posts were
                        staying on. It was a time of great flux. How did you and Livingston Merchant
                        figure out what the hell we were going to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>DONELAN: First I should point out that it was Livingston Merchant's job to figure
                    out and make recommendations as to what the US was going to do; I had the
                    relatively simple part of working to provide the resources necessary to support
                    the policy decisions. In situations like that you tried to protect the budgetary
                    or funding level that you had as well as make allowances for what might happen,
                    e.g., costs for evacuation of personnel. We had to cope with the changing
                    situation as we started getting pushed out of those places. What had been a
                    fairly large operation financially really required less monetary resources as
                    the posts closed down; the thing you had to do was to have flexibility in how to
                    use the money you had.</p>
                <p>There was one little side light which I'm not sure many people are aware of.
                    Communication in China between posts was by radio. The radio operators were
                    usually Chinese. You could never tell anybody anything anywhere in China without
                    almost instantaneously informing every local employee in China, exactly what was
                    going on (at least administratively). This worked positively and it worked
                    negatively. I forget the number of posts offhand, but the fact of the matter was
                    that we had few options and got pushed out as the Chinese Communists took over.
                    Money, per se, was not a limiting factor at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was sort of the operations mode at the time? Was
                        there a feeling of, “Gee, this is a real problem. Anything you want,
                        fellows, we'll do for you within limits”? Or were you under sort of normal
                        constraints that one thinks about as being, “Well, you sure you really need
                        this?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: There was no doubt in anyone's mind as to the seriousness of the
                    situation, and I think everyone acted accordingly; it was not business as usual,
                    and as far as I can recall no one ever suffered from an unwillingness of the
                    Department to use all its resources. One non-monetary situation I recall
                    occurred when the Commies took over in Shanghai. Our people at the Consulate
                    General were placed under very, very serious restraints by the Chinese. We had
                    to cut down the staff and had to get rid of the local employees. In these days
                    there are all sorts of rules and ramifications with respect to fringe benefits
                    and termination pay and all that sort of thing, but believe me, in 1949 Foreign
                    Service Regulations were rather sparse when it came to any kind of benefits. And
                    the Communist authorities were demanding that such benefits be paid to the
                    locals being forced out of the Consulate. Since there were no regulations
                    covering termination pay, Ed Lyerly, a top-flight lawyer in the Department Legal
                    Adviser's Office and I, sat down and a wrote a regulation which authorized the
                    payment of termination pay for local employees under certain conditions which
                    just happened to be those extant in Shanghai. It went to the Secretary and he
                    signed off on it and we didn't publish it for a long time. But essentially we
                    paid termination pay to those Chinese employees we separated. And this was under
                    pressure from the Red Chinese. We probably would have made some sort of ex
                    gratia payment when separating employees, but in effect they were pushing. So we
                    actually made it official and made it legal and wrote the regulation and paid
                    off.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. I don't know whether this pertains or not, but the fact
                        you said it wasn't published, I recall when I was in Yugoslavia in the
                        1960's that there were some people there who had been arrested, local
                        employees in the early 50's or really before that, about the same time
                        you're talking about, who were told, I have been told, that if they got out
                        of Yugoslavia they would be entitled to some payments. But they couldn't be
                        paid while they were in Yugoslavia. I'm not sure of the ins and outs of
                        this. This was being kept rather closely guarded. But if they could ever get
                        out, this was still at a time of some constraints. This may be part of your
                        regulation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: WW II and the Iron Curtain begat somewhat similar problems, but I don't
                    believe the people you mention were covered under that regulation which was
                    narrowly written specifically to cover the situation in China. There were a
                    significant number of people who had served the US government long and well in
                    some of the European embassies. Many of them just drifted away or died or
                    whatever. But there were a fair number of them who did receive payments. In some
                    countries, and I believe later, Yugoslavia was one of them, former US government
                    employees were allowed to receive checks. But there was a quite solid basis for
                    compensation since most of the old time foreign national employees of the
                    Foreign Service were employed under Civil Service regulations, and were entitled
                    to back pay, and many to annuities. In addition however there were some cases of
                    widows who were destitute, and word would come in, and payments were made to
                    these people. This type of payment could be effected by the Department from an
                    appropriation which had been established in the time of President George
                    Washington for “emergencies in the diplomatic and consular service”.That's a
                    long way round to answer your question, but the fact is, I think the Department
                    did quite well when the chips were down and something had to be done.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to when you were in the fiscal and the budget
                        projecting business, did you find — we're talking about the 1950's Foreign
                        Service — that they were fairly good? Obviously a China situation, things
                        were falling apart, and who the hell knew what was going to happen? But in
                        other area, did you think that those that were making their projections and
                        making their budgets, were pretty good or was the system working fairly
                        well?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>DONELAN: In the early 1950s the Department's budgetary system was pretty well
                    established but it was a fairly laborious process. In April of each year the
                    posts received a “budget call” from the Department which required the submission
                    of reams and reams of information and paper, supposedly reflecting their
                    staffing and monetary requirements for, not the upcoming fiscal year which would
                    begin in July l, just three months away, but for the next fiscal year, which
                    would begin fifteen months later. It was extremely difficult for these mostly
                    small foreign service posts to forecast their staffing and monetary needs six
                    months in advance, much less fifteen months away. Over time the process was
                    simplified and radically improved, and the workload on thindividual post sharply
                    decreased. Essentially, what we arrived at was an “exception” system under which
                    the post justified what they thought they needed right now, and not fifteen
                    months away. The overall flow however was the same: the Department central
                    budget office (as did every agency) received broad limits on money and people
                    from the Office of Budget. The Department budget office tasked all of the
                    geographic offices, later bureaus and the functional offices (Office of Econ
                    Affairs, Passport Office, etc.), field posts were directed to submit their
                    requirements for resources. The flow then reversed back to the central budget
                    office, which put together the budget for the Department as a whole, along the
                    line receiving the Secretary's imprimatur. Officials from the Department with
                    the budget office defended their request before the Office of Budget. The
                    Department's budget became part of the President's budget submission to the
                    Congress and subsequently, hearings were held before the appropriate Committees
                    of the Congress, bills passed and money received by the Department for its
                    world-wide operation.</p>
                <p>In short the system worked quite well; no one ever thought his area got a fair
                    share; the central budget office felt the OMB discriminated against the Dept.;
                    the Congress were all skin-flints; but somehow the job got done, and the Foreign
                    Service survived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, moving on - After your initial assignment in the
                        Dept., you were assigned to the Embassy in Paris for some years, returned to
                        the Department for another assignment, and then were appointed to go to
                        Nagoya, Japan as the principal officer. How did these subsequent assignments
                        come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: After my initial assignment to the Foreign Service Planning Division, I
                    spent a short time as Budget Officer in the Bureau of Latin American Affairs,
                    and then went to Paris in January 1952 as Budget &amp; Management Officer. I
                    became an FSO in Paris in 1955 under the Wriston program and was transferred
                    back to Washington in 1956. I must say that as a brand new Foreign Service
                    Officer I would have preferred continuing overseas, but we learned early on in
                    those days, that the commitment was to go where the Department directed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: 1956. To be Director of the Office of Finance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your responsibilities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: As you know the Department had a central Budget Office which consisted
                    of two arms; one for the Departmental and Foreign Service budget and the other
                    one for Finance. The finance people were the bookkeepers and accountants for the
                    Department of State and the Foreign Service. Finance administered all fiscal and
                    accounting regulations; updated and revised systems and devised new systems of
                    funds management and accountability. It was the technical fiscal operation of
                    the Department. I came back as Director of that office after having been Budget
                    &amp; Management Officer in Paris for four and a half years. The Paris job had
                    been a great experience, and while I would have preferred another overseas
                    assignment, this Finance job really offered opportunity to make changes in the
                    Department's operation. In fact my first initiative was looking back overseas in
                    the direction of fiscal operations in the European embassies. And the idea was
                    predicated on the fact that the PTT (Post, Telegraph &amp; Telephone) government
                    monopolies in the European and North African countries were extremely efficient
                    in moving the mail, in fact a letter could be mailed one day in Paris and be
                    received in anyone of the other countries by the next day, and the French were
                    particularly efficient as I recall - you could mail a letter in downtown Paris
                    in the morning and be quite certain that it would be received at a suburban
                    address that same afternoon. The second major consideration that Paris was in
                    itself a large operation, for a long time the largest Embassy in Europe, it had
                    an available skilled and educated population, and the French nationals already
                    employed by the Embassy were very able and clever people.The idea was very
                    simple, instead of all these embassies and offices in Europe madly writing
                    checks, paying bills, and engaging in foreign exchange transactions with local
                    banks, centralize the operation in Paris and get the benefit of the economy of
                    scale and the skilled workers available. I assigned Dennis Collins, who had
                    worked with me in the Paris budget and fiscal operation, to the project. Denny
                    who was fluent in French and had served in several European countries was a
                    natural for the job, visiting a number of the posts, confirming the efficacy of
                    the PTT systems in the various countries, and discussing the possibilities with
                    our colleagues in Europe. As a result of his work we decided we could set up a
                    regional finance center in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in your making the decision, I'm a little
                        interested, there must have been some turf battles or crockery broken when
                        you move an office from one place to another. How did this sit?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>DONELAN: In all my years in the Foreign Service whenever there was a squeeze on
                    resources, the first place Ambassadors and senior personnel in the Department
                    looked to take cuts, was in the administrative area. It was natural to protect
                    the so called “substantive” side of foreign operations, and since the raison
                    d'etre of “administration” is to support program operations, it's hard to fault
                    that approach, even if you happen to be in charge of administration. In fact I
                    always considered it a basic responsibility of administration to press
                    constantly for the most economical and efficient methods of operation.</p>
                <p>In this case we were coming up with very substantial personnel reductions for all
                    the posts in Europe and north Africa, probably an average of one or two American
                    positions and three or four foreign national positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that's about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Yes, and there were very substantial initial net savings, for a very
                    modest investment of people and equipment in Paris, and more over the years.</p>
                <p>RFC maintained bank accounts in all the currencies of the serviced countries;
                    issued salary checks for Americans and foreign national employees - all types of
                    allowance payments for American employees - paid all recurring bills for the
                    missions themselves and the employees - rent, light, heat, power, local country
                    purchases, etc. All of this for starters. Denny went back to Paris and ran the
                    operation. He was inventive and innovative. Over the years he developed the
                    system and operation far beyond my original concept. And you will recognize how
                    unusual this is, but the Department finally came to understand the uniqueness of
                    Denny's position and gave up trying to transfer elsewhere. Denny finished his
                    career in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any particular difficulties in the
                        Department, in your office? Or did you find that what you were doing was not
                        fairly routine work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: The routines of the operation pretty much took care of themselves,
                    regulations were written and changed, the systems people were pretty good about
                    coming up with improvements and from time to time the office came up with real
                    advances. Another facet of my job was liaison for the Department with the Office
                    of the Comptroller General which as “the watchdog of the treasury” was
                    responsible to the Congress, and the Treasury Department which of course was the
                    source of all funds appropriated by the Congress.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>People were funny of course, and whether we recognize it in ourselves or not all
                    of us resist change almost automatically. There was always some selling to be
                    done before launching something new and different. You won some and you lost
                    some. I had informal discussions with some banks about the idea of setting up a
                    totally free checking accounts for all American employees in the Foreign
                    Service; we in Washington would then write all American salary checks and
                    automatically deposit the funds in a selected bank, splitting up the business
                    among banks interested in providing free service. Would have been a great saving
                    for the Dept., I always kept a checking account myself in Washington, the banks
                    thought it was a great idea, but it bombed out. People in those days just wanted
                    to receive their checks in their little hot hands and that was that. This type
                    of thing is now commonplace. Another thing whose time had not quite come.and
                    this idea was several years later was to use an “exception” method of fiscal
                    reporting. In other words instead of sending in voluminous accounts to the
                    Department through the pouch which was the custom, taking forever....would be to
                    cable short excerpts which simply gave pluses or minuses against the one or more
                    allotment accounts which the posts had available. Actually about a half dozen or
                    so Foreign Service posts, the large ones, given their size and staffing,
                    expended most of the funds...so if you got wire reports from these posts you
                    knew where you stood financially...most of the other posts were so small, even
                    if you didn't hear from them it wouldn't matter all that much. The
                    communications system couldn't handle the load...nowadays it would be a piece of
                    cake. But it was fun, even so dry an area as fiscal reporting.</p>
                <p>But, and I think this has been part of my satisfaction, generally when you came
                    up with something new and something different people would accept it and work
                    with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the innovation was usually accepted if it was
                        demonstrated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: That's right, and actually it was a great time to be in the Department
                    and the Foreign Service. This was reasonably in the post WWII period and you
                    remember that prior to WW II the Department of State and the Foreign Service,
                    was a very small organization. We owned practically no real estate abroad, very
                    few embassies, and several of the first ambassadorial residences abroad were
                    gifts from American citizens, I think Doris Duke gave us the old ambassadorial
                    residence in Paris. WW II triggered a great many US government operations
                    abroad, the operation of the Marshall plan alone brought at first hundreds and
                    then several thousand American and foreign national employees onto the payroll;
                    then came USIA, the information program which became integral to overseas
                    operations. ...and pretty soon, Treasury and Customs people were abroad,
                    Agricultural, etc. ... You know when I was in Paris, I believe twenty some US
                    government agencies were represented...of the Embassy population, only 1 in 5
                    was a State Department employee, but the Department of State was charged with
                    providing administrative support to most of these agencies.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>So it was in this period that the Foreign Service had to learn all about
                    administration. The Department actively recruited experienced administrative
                    personnel; that's why people like Graham Martin came to work for the Department
                    of State. Graham had been a Colonel in the Air Force and previously with the
                    Public Health Service at the National Institutes of Health.</p>
                <p>I mentioned Henry Ford earlier. Henry had worked for the Bureau of the Budget
                    before the war, but was recruited by the Department after service in the Air
                    Force. When I came in in '49 not the, you know the tail end, but close to the
                    tail end of recruiting, the Department was learning the hard way about
                    administering large groups of people in many strange places.Again, a long way
                    round, but yes, innovation was accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you weren't having to, in a way, beat down an
                        entrenched administrative bureaucracy? There really wasn't one there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: You're absolutely right, and quite candidly a lot of free wheeling was
                    possible, and you got into funny positions sometimes but there weren't a lot of
                    people breathing down your neck when you were in charge of something. They came
                    later particularly when and if something went awry! And sometimes the things you
                    ran into were fascinating; I remember the then head of the Passport Office, the
                    famous old lady. ......</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ruth Shipley.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Yes, Ma Shipley. As Director of Finance, I watched the flow of things
                    pretty carefully, like for instance the flow of checks from some offices which
                    normally received payment for services. A funny thing had happened. The flow of
                    checks from the Passport office had stopped. No answers. We finally got someone
                    to look in her desk. She had stacks and stacks of checks that had come in. They
                    had been addressed to her, and delivered to her, and she stuck them in her desk
                    drawer. And, of course the fundamental rule in government (as in any good
                    business) when you get a check deposit it right away. Well, she had some checks,
                    some of them were as I remember several months old, and perhaps one or two
                    several years old. But anyway that's beside the point. You found little pockets
                    like this once in a while but generally speaking, I feel that the Department was
                    an exciting place to work because if you came up with something good, people
                    were really quite willing to try it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you came in with sort of a war-trained generation,
                        too. I think this was another thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Yes, it was sort of, “We can do it”. We can make it better. Maybe we
                    couldn't but we sure as hell thought we could.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. I'd like to come to Nagoya. You were assigned
                        as principal officer to Nagoya in 1958. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: I told you about being a new FSO?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're saying a new FSO because prior to that
                        you........</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: When I went to Paris I became a Foreign Service Staff Officer with
                    Attach� status; prior to that and when I was hired for the Foreign Service
                    Planning Division I was a departmental employee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Civil Service then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Yes, right. Then I was made an FSS to go to Paris, became an FSO-3 in
                    Paris, and then returned to the Department</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Under the Wriston Program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: That's right. I took the short route to become an FSO, Foreign Service
                    Officer; the usual investigations, the essay and appearance before a Board of
                    senior officers from the Embassy. I'll always remember the Chairman of the
                    group, was Fred Lyons, who at the time was Supervising Consul General in Paris -
                    that is in addition to the Embassy responsibility he was responsible for the
                    oversight of the operation of all of the Consular Offices in France. Did you
                    ever know him? He was fine gentleman of the Old School. (I'm not sure if he
                    really approved of the Wriston program, but I made it).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I never did know him.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>DONELAN: After I was back in the Finance job for about a year and a half,
                    although still technically Director, I went to work for Bill Hall, who was THE
                    Budget Officer for the Department My particular assignment was to work with
                    Ambassador Loy Henderson who then was Deputy Under Secretary for Management, who
                    did all the opening statements on the budget, before the respective
                    Congressional Appropriations Committees. Specifically I prepared supporting
                    documents, briefing book, and helped draft statements for his presentations. I
                    say helped draft statements, because he plunged right in himself, nothing hands
                    off about him. One little quirk, he abhorred “split infinitives” and I never
                    more consciously split an infinitive after working with that marvelous man. In
                    time I got to indicate to him my preference for an overseas assignment, and
                    given his long service abroad he was sympathetic to the idea that a new FSO
                    should rack up overseas time instead of being in the Department Findley Burns
                    was in personnel at the time (guess he went from there to be Ambassador to
                    Jordan) but I let him know that if something came along I didn't think Mr.
                    Henderson would object to my leaving. Shortly thereafter Outerbridge Horsey (one
                    of the famous foreign service names) who was Deputy Chief of Mission in Tokyo
                    came back to the Department on consultation. Seems he was looking to fill two
                    jobs in Japan: one was the Executive Officer slot at the Consulate General in
                    Kobe, the other was the Principal Officer job in Nagoya. Findley of the agile
                    mind, said he might talk to Joe Donelan. Outerbridge Horsey said, “ Is he a
                    Japanese language officer?” And in his best Findleyesque style, the answer was
                    that he didn't know, but he thought my French was pretty good and maybe my
                    Spanish was okay also.</p>
                <p>Horsey did call me and I went to see him. He said he'd looked at my background
                    and history and he said: “I don't know. There are two jobs”, and then he
                    described what I had heard about Kobe and Nagoya. He then asked me if I had a
                    choice, which position would I select. I told him that if I were he, in looking
                    at my background one might conclude that I could do the job in Kobe but that my
                    personal preference was the Principal Officer job in Nagoya, where I would have
                    full responsibility for the operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you opted for the PO job. Then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: In about eight weeks, incredibly, along came a cable from Ambassador
                    MacArthur saying he would accept me for the Nagoya job. I almost couldn't
                    believe it.My transition from the Department was pretty smooth; Bill Hall as
                    always was most cooperative, particularly when it meant a step up for one of his
                    associates - and this was a real switcheroo, basically an administrative type
                    jumping over to running a Consular operation. Moreover Bill Crockett by this
                    time was back in the States from Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is William Crockett?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>DONELAN: Yes this is William J. Crockett, who had just completed his assignment
                    in Rome as Counselor of Embassy for Administration to be deputy to the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary of State for Budget and Finance, William O. Hall, who some
                    years later became Ambassador to Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to just ask, Loy Henderson was such a major
                        figure in the post-war Foreign Service, working with him, what was his
                        operating style would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Well, his operating style did not necessarily represent the very latest
                    in management techniques, but it was in the best tradition of the Service. He
                    really knew the Foreign Service and the people in it, and that of course is
                    fundamental to being a good manager. He made decisions and he stood behind those
                    decisions; he worked like hell, and when there was something to be done he
                    stayed with it. He was a very sincere man, and of course the Foreign Service was
                    his life. As I recall he came into the Department and the Service right after
                    finishing his university studies. He was very intense but when he appeared
                    before the Congress justifying the needs of the Department people listened to
                    him. He didn't always get what he wanted but it wasn't for lack of trying. I
                    remember how John Rooney on occasion would needle him just to get him going.
                    Then he's stop and say “Now John, now John”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Rooney was the .......</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Was the Chairman of the Subcommittee of the House Appropriations
                    Committee, a Democrat from Brooklyn, N.Y. However he had a deep respect for Mr.
                    Henderson. As an aside, John J. Rooney has really been maligned by some people
                    in the Department and I believe quite unfairly. No question but he was tough,
                    but he had a proprietary interest in the Department and once he took an
                    appropriations bill to the floor, he would fight fiercely for what he thought
                    was right. He was on that Committee for years, and a lot of people in the
                    Department didn't know as much about the Foreign Service as Rooney did. And
                    let's face it the Department didn't always put it's best foot forward.
                    Incidentally, I always got along with Rooney, and that came in handy in later
                    years. I don't know it to be a fact but when President Nixon submitted my
                    nomination to the Senate for it's “advice and consent”, I believe John Rooney,
                    the Democrat, supported my appointment.</p>
                <p>Before coming to Congress Rooney had been an Assistant District Attorney in
                    Brooklyn. I believe some of his claim to fame was in the prosecution of a very
                    tough water-front gang known as Murder, Inc. which was trying to control the New
                    York water-front. It was a time when the port was beginning to boom with
                    lend-lease to Britain and later to Russia. It was during that period that I was
                    working in Wall Street, but I was moon-lighting on the docks in my spare time.
                    And being a born New Yorker didn't hurt either, so I did always get along well
                    with Rooney. (I seem to specialize in asides).</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no, I think that's interesting. But back to Nagoya,
                        and what were your principal duties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: As you know a Consulate is pretty much a branch office of the Embassy,
                    with a political, economic-commercial and consular functions, but with in the
                    case of Nagoya considerable emphasis on economic and commercial work, and of
                    course all usual in the consular line - service to Americans,(very few in the
                    area), issuance of visas, handling ships papers, etc. There were fourteen people
                    on the staff, six Americans and eight foreign national employees. We also had a
                    branch USIS office in Nagoya. My personal responsibility in addition to
                    overseeing the work of the office was in political reporting, such as it was,
                    and maintaining contacts with the Japanese business and government community.
                    Nagoya in addition to being the third largest city in Japan at the time, was the
                    headquarters of the Aichi Prefecture with a Governor resident in Nagoya. It's
                    port was the principal port of entry for American raw cotton bought by the
                    Japanese.The Embassy would task all the Consulates at different times and for
                    different areas of reporting, for example, labor unions encouraged under the
                    occupation were starting to feel their oats..and the Embassy would call for a
                    country-wide round-up on what was going on, what was happening or who was doing
                    what to whom in local elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it easy to report in Japan in about the late 50's? Did
                        you have fairly easy access or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Generally yes, the atmosphere was right, business was booming, the
                    Toyota Auto had just begun exporting cars to the States, with I might add not
                    too great success at first, Noritake shipping to some 76 countries, but the US
                    was the best customer; the plywood industry was just getting into stride;
                    Japanese were selling things to the US and they were buying things from the US.
                    It was fascinating. Having been in the Pacific during WW II (Okinawa) I went to
                    Japan with this mental image built in, and when I talked to these people and
                    they were so pleasant and so friendly I used to think, “What is he really
                    thinking? What is going through this man's mind?” Nagoya was 95% fire bombed in
                    the final months of the war (the site of the Japanese aircraft industry). I
                    wonder how many of his relatives were killed? You had to think a lot.</p>
                <p>But an incident occurred, a natural disaster, the result of which gave me
                    incredible entry in the community. The worst typhoon in Japanese history swept
                    up the Ise Bay, almost crushed the city of Nagoya, and in passing flooded the
                    port areas, up-rooted trees, power lines, smashed thousands of homes and killed
                    some 6,000 people. As Consul I found myself in charge of the American relief
                    operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in '58?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>DONELAN: This was in '59. We had gotten to Japan in August of 1958, and it was
                    now May 1959. It's a long story. But power was out for days, houses down the
                    street from me were sliced in half; my car was immobilized under some huge trees
                    which fell, and I got to the Consulate the morning of the first day by bicycle.
                    I got in touch with the Embassy through the Japanese Tactical Air Wing
                    Communications operation in nearby Gifu. Relief supplies were in by NorthWest
                    Airline; Admiral Kivette who was the commander of the Sixth Fleet sent in a
                    small aircraft carrier the USS Kearsage which was on its way for duty in Japan;
                    we had forty eight American helicopters, Army, Navy, Marine, Air Force working
                    off of a huge field in front of the City Hall; the Kearsage sent boats and
                    medical parties out over the flooded areas, the choppers dropped food, blankets
                    and fire wood to the little islands of people on the clumps of land which had
                    been the high ground, and they picked up hundreds and hundreds people and lifted
                    them to safety. They did the work and the American Consulate got the credit. And
                    the credit line was almost inexhaustible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I notice you received a superior service award. Was this
                        because of the ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: That was just one of those things. A piece of paper the Department gave
                    you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they don't pass them out too often.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: That was basically what it was all about, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how were your relations at the post with Tokyo? Did
                        you find that it worked well or not so well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: I think the relationships were really good. I went to Tokyo
                    infrequently, but I preferred Nagoya to Tokyo anyway. The Embassy would call us
                    in for special occasions, like briefings and preparations for special Trade
                    Missions, who then came to our districts. Ambassador MacArthur came for a visit
                    for a few days and it was a whirlwind, but successful. He was very popular being
                    a namesake of the General, but extremely capable in his own right. After
                    MacArthur left, Reischauer became Ambassador, a very distinguished man, who knew
                    more of the Japanese language than many Japanese.</p>
                <p>I had one big battle with the Dept of Commerce in Washington who seemed to think
                    that the Japanese were never right, but the Embassy, and our Minister for
                    Economic Affairs really supported my position and you can't ask any better than
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the Economic Counselor in Tokyo?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>DONELAN: Actually he had ministerial rank. He's long since retired but I believe
                    he's still with Brookings, here in Washington. But, the fact is, the support was
                    excellent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to move on. You worked a relatively short time as
                        Consul General in Tokyo. Was that long enough to talk about really before

                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Not really. In fact I've always said it must have been the shortest
                    tenure as Consul General on record. It's probably worth noting that the Foreign
                    Service Inspectors came to Nagoya to inspect the operation. They said three and
                    a half years in Nagoya was enough and I should move on to a larger operation. I
                    really didn't want to go. Nagoya was the greatest experience in my career; I
                    took a Japanese lesson every day; gave speeches all over the place; traveled
                    throughout the Consular District; went to factories; plant openings. The
                    Inspectors meant well, but I thought now they're moving me just when I really
                    know this place.</p>
                <p>We went on home leave, and then on to Tokyo. We were there some weeks, and on the
                    day that Mrs. Donelan finally cleared the last of the excelsior and packing
                    material out of the apartment, a Personnel Officer in the Department phoned the
                    Embassy. Now in those days for the Department to make a phone call to Tokyo, you
                    knew there was big trouble. The upshot of it was that I was transferred to New
                    Delhi.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going to New Delhi, what was the problem? Why did you go
                        and why had the other man left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: John Kenneth Galbraith was the new Ambassador to India. He was a close
                    friend to President Kennedy, he really was. I guess the President, as
                    President's are wont to do, told him he could have whatever staff he wanted.
                    Since Galbraith didn't know me from a hole in the wall I've always assumed that
                    the culprit was his Deputy Chief of Mission, a man by the name of Benson E.L.
                    Timmons, III, more familiarly known later in the Embassy, Bacon, Lettuce and
                    Tomato! I had known Timmons briefly in Paris,, where he had been deputy chief of
                    the aid mission to France. And I suppose that was how my name got there. So we
                    arrived in Delhi in I guess August 1961, and I was Counselor of Embassy for
                    Administration. That was an exciting time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Galbraith operate as an Ambassador from your
                        vantage point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>DONELAN: Actually, I liked the way “Professor” Galbraith as the Indians always
                    called him, operated. He was the Chairman of the Board, he had a staff and he
                    expected them to operate with a certain amount of initiative and independence,
                    and he had a Deputy Chief of Mission to whom he delegated all of the day to day
                    operations of the Mission. This was the preferred way for a “political”
                    Ambassador to operate, that is by delegating the usual stuff to a career Deputy.
                    Galbraith functioned very effectively; he traveled the country widely; he met
                    with and knew countless Indian officials, and certainly had complete access to
                    the highest levels of government. If the operation had any weakness it was the
                    manner in which his deputy worked; and to a considerable extent the deputy was
                    the one who discouraged initiatives and individual judgments, but this mostly
                    was a result of his insecurity.</p>
                <p>It was the conventional wisdom that early in his tenure, the Ambassador was
                    inclined to be overly impressed with the requirements/demands of the Indians,
                    but that didn't last as he quietly adjusted his own attitude after sufficient
                    exposure, and I guess toward the end of his tour he perhaps was more inclined to
                    shake his finger at some of the plaints rather than being convinced of the need.
                    He was terribly skeptical of the professionals and the career Foreign Service
                    Officer in particular. And he may have had good cause for that, but I don't
                    know. He personally wrote short, terse and classic cables to the Department
                    which frequently became conversational pieces. (And yes he had a good personal
                    relationship with President Kennedy, and yes on occasion he would pick up the
                    phone and call him at the White House). In terms of personal relationships, once
                    he decided you knew what you were doing, that was it until you might prove
                    otherwise. I guess I had been there for a week when a disaster cropped up
                    somewhere in that vast country.....</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Famine or earthquake or flood?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>DONELAN: As a matter of fact, as I recall it was a flood - and areas of India
                    almost always flooded after the monsoon season, and with great damage to life
                    and property. The Ambassador called me and said “We've got to give the Indians
                    $50,000 or $60,000. The United States is rich and they expect us to help out in
                    this catastrophe. So I want you to draw a check right now”. And I said “We can't
                    do that”. Well, the simple matter of fact is that American Embassies, no matter
                    how big they might be, never have been known to have 50,000 or so dollars
                    hanging around loose in an allotment account which at any given moment could
                    sustain that amount. I did remember that there had been a mechanism provided in
                    the foreign aid appropriation, under which in case of an “emergency” an
                    Ambassador could draw down an amount up to $50,000 without prior approval of
                    Washington. But that had been a couple of years ago, and verification of the
                    authority would be prudent. He didn't like anybody to tell him what he couldn't
                    do, but then I told him if I could have twenty minutes or so to check something
                    out, I thought it might be done. I did check it, it was still a valid authority,
                    and it was done, and the Ambassador called the Prime Minister and notified him
                    of the gift. From then on the Ambassador didn't expect me to do everything right
                    away, but twenty minutes or so later was okay. He was a fascinating man,
                    renowned in his own right as an economist, a forecaster of the '29 depression, a
                    facile writer of books, and a great conversationalist, although some people said
                    he did most of the conversing. But I think he was a good Ambassador and a very
                    successful representative of the President and US interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your dealings on your side as administrative
                        officer with the Indians because you must have had probably more contact
                        with the Indian bureaucracy than anybody else in the business? How did this
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: I dealt with the Foreign Ministry, and with various other officials of
                    the Indian government on a continuing basis - principally in the areas of
                    immunities and privileges of American personnel in the Mission (Mission being,
                    Embassy, AID, USIS, Military Attach�s, Agriculture and Commerce, Treasury and
                    other assorted US representatives, and after the invasion of India by the
                    Chinese Communists in connection with the USMSMI (U. S. Military Supply Mission,
                    India) accreditation and diplomatic status, free entry of personal and official
                    materials, diplomatic pouch, and diverse other instances - e.g., an official
                    American is in an automobile accident - and what to do about it? Etc.</p>
                <p>The Indians were always very picky on everything we did in this area, part of it
                    understandable sensitivity, part of it their nature, and their bureaucratic
                    operation, which probably was the worst I'd ever seen (not that we're simon
                    pure), and part of it other Ministries such as Finance, resenting the authority
                    of the Foreign Affairs people. (And that happens in all governments!)</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>We had a good American School starting up and we needed a lot of equipment, for
                    instance microscopes for the labs in the High School. And they said: “Well, you
                    must pay duty on these things”. And the duty of course was about five times the
                    cost of the item in the States. Since they were adamant, we simply changed the
                    name of the addressee, and had the stuff consigned to the Ambassador personally.
                    So the Ambassador got these huge supplies and equipment, and they never fought
                    it. But there was a definite technique in working with the Indians, which once
                    learned, was quite effective. I remember when I first heard the term “red tape”,
                    I thought it was sort of a joke, but I learned that it originated with the
                    British in India, and that their students, the Indians learned their lessons
                    very well.</p>
                <p>And you can actually see “red tape”. Quite contrary to the American penchant for
                    making five copies of everything; the Indians made no copies of anything. They
                    registered documents in and out but they never made copies. As a paper moved
                    from office to office and as each unit or office made its comments or gave an
                    approval or disapproval, the new piece of paper was added to the file so that in
                    a remarkably short time on its way through the bureaucracy, the bundle of paper
                    was tied together with “red tape”. So you learned that there was a natural
                    progression through certain ministries from this desk to this desk and to this
                    desk. And you discovered that if you got to know this man very well on any one
                    of these items, he could always call up a document from lower down in the chain.
                    So this is the way it worked. You found out who was closest to the Minister, or
                    the Minister, and you went to him. And automatically you could save three or
                    four weeks on anything that had to be processed through the government.</p>
                <p>And then there was the Chinese invasion of India. That was a very busy time for
                    the Counselor of Embassy for Administration. Later on I said that I thought that
                    the invasion of the American Supply Mission to India was much more difficult and
                    troublesome than the actual invasion of India by the Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you as Administrative Counselor, become involved
                        with the Embassy efforts during the India and Chinese War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: The Ambassador could see what was happening - with the Chinese
                    threatening and posturing on the northern borders and the Indians pretty much
                    defenseless particularly in the mountain conditions - although the Indians had
                    made pretty short work in '61 of Goa, the hapless Portuguese enclave in warm
                    southern India.The Ambassador wanted help and he wanted it quick from the US.
                    The President sent Averell Harriman out with a special mission - which included
                    a four star general, the chief of the newly organized “Strike Command”,
                    headquartered in McDill Field, Florida. There were about twenty people in the
                    party which included Harriman's aide, Bill Sullivan, a fairly junior officer at
                    the time, but who later was Ambassador to Manila and then to Tehran.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>This was in November 1962 - we were having our little Chinese Communist invasion
                    and the US was having its “Missile Crisis” in Cuba (October '62?). All of the
                    Harriman group and most of the “Country Team” members had Thanksgiving Dinner at
                    the Galbraith's - we all pretty much sat around on the floor, kicking around
                    courses of action and what should be done when. It really was typical of the
                    Indians that in later discussions, they were adamant as to what the planned
                    assistance group should be called. At this point the US quite commonly had MAAG
                    - Military Assistance Advisory Groups - in many countries whose function was to
                    provide technicians and technical training and support, including supplies and
                    equipment, to the host country military., The mission to India was identical but
                    the MAAG name was felt by the Indians to be an affront (to their dignity?) - so
                    it became, as I indicated earlier, USMSMI.</p>
                <p>First thing we got on to was arranging radio frequencies for the flow of American
                    aircraft, which was to and did airlift supplies and equipment into the country.
                    This was pretty much handled by Bob Richardson, Embassy Communications Officer.
                    It was decided over the next few days that the group would require a staff of
                    about ninety people. And that's where we were totally involved. When they said
                    they would need office space (obvious) the Ambassador said “ Joe, you take care
                    of it.” And this was followed by need for temporary quarters, people coming and
                    going on TDY (I leased a small hotel); by housing, which was set aside in a new
                    residential area of town, mostly by pulling and tugging with the Indians, this
                    for the sort of permanent staff, and then of course furniture and stuff to make
                    the houses habitable -which I might add included putting in Western style
                    toilets, and stoves and refrigerators and of course air conditioning, etc. So
                    that's the way it worked. And that was my part of the thing and we did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hadn't realized that we'd had such an extensive military
                        assistance effort in India.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Yes, actually we did, not nearly as large as in many countries, but
                    there for a fairly extended period of time, in fact long after I left the post.
                    As is understandable, politics of relationships was involved; remember that up
                    until that time Mr. Nehru had been very pious about his non-alignment, and was
                    not averse to sticking his finger in our eye on occasion. This was a
                    breakthrough; he needed help and the US provided it. It was a fairly short lived
                    invasion and I believe the Chinese accomplished exactly what they wanted - which
                    was to humiliate Mr. Nehru.</p>
                <p>We in the Embassy were watching to see if the Chinese would use aircraft to bomb
                    Delhi - they never did. But we put up blackout stuff and lights were dimmed in
                    the city. I didn't think they had any intention of doing so. I made an
                    observation at a meeting and some people were pretty upset with me for saying I
                    didn't think the Chinese were coming at all. I wasn't pretending to be a
                    military expert, I just felt that the Chinese were too smart to conquer India,
                    because if they conquered India they'd be responsible for all these millions and
                    millions of people. It would simply destroy the whole Chinese Communist
                    movement. But they did march into India, they pushed some military units around,
                    they spiked some artillery, and then left, just like that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did that involve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Essentially the responsibility was that of chief administrative officer
                    of the Agency. ACDA was an independent Agency of the US government; it had it's
                    own budget; it's own staff; and principally was a planning and negotiating arm
                    of the Executive Branch in the field of arms control and disarmament matters.
                    The Director of the Agency, at that time, William C. Foster, reported directly
                    to the President, but for foreign policy guidance he reported to the Secretary
                    of State. The Agency was housed in the Department of State building.</p>
                <p>The staffing of this small group was unique. One group of very bright, sharp
                    young men, some scientists from academia and industry, mostly physicists - some
                    with intelligence backgrounds, some having been involved with atomic weapons for
                    most of their young lives. Countering, was a group of military, fairly senior
                    military people, all of whom were involved in some way in strategic planning and
                    nuclear weapons and nuclear defenses, offensive and defensive weapons. And then
                    the Foreign Service people who essentially were experienced political officers.
                    Jacob Beam who was Assistant Director for Political Affairs, had been Ambassador
                    to Moscow and Ambassador to Prague, a very distinguished career office. So you
                    had this mixture of the scientific types, the military and the State Department,
                    really remarkably able people, who were held pretty much together through the
                    skills of the Director and his Deputy. A separate adjunct to the Agency was the
                    President's Disarmament Commission which was chaired at that time by John J.
                    McCloy, one of the “Wise Men” of post war US bipartisan foreign affairs

                        Department of State because you were housed in the Department of State? Were
                        you appreciated or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: On the appreciation side first, sometimes there is a real doubt if there
                    is any such thing in government as appreciation; however, the physical location
                    in the Department of State was appropriate - we had senior career officers who
                    were well known to others in the geographic bureaus with whom a great deal of
                    clearance work had to be conducted, the agency was a little bit of a thorn in
                    the side of the military and the Atomic Energy Commission was not wild about
                    this crowd who got to be in charge of all the important international
                    negotiations.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>We had no great problems on the operating side except practical and physical
                    limitations. Bill Foster, understanding how the bureaucracy worked shortcut a
                    lot of those things quite effectively, had a very good rapport with William J.
                    Crockett who at this time had become Deputy Under Secretary for Management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you sort of steer him in that direction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: No, I didn't have to, he was well steered before I got there. Early on
                    Foster had gotten a commitment that career officers would be assigned to ACDA.
                    He had an agreement with Crockett that the Service would provide the Executive
                    Director for the Agency, with the understanding that the individual had to get
                    involved, learn something about weapons and scientific research in the nuclear
                    field (ACDA had a fairly substantial contract research program), as well as
                    having Administrative experience. Actually well before I finished my tour at the
                    National War College, it had evidently been agreed that my next assignment would
                    be with ACDA, about which I had rarely heard and knew less about. I don't know
                    what might have been better and I'll never know, but I later found out that
                    William O. Hall, now Deputy Administrator for the AID operation, wanted to give
                    me a try as a Mission Director for an AID operation overseas. That would have
                    been interesting too - who knows what might have happened. Part of the
                    fascination of the Service?</p>
                <p>In retrospect of what we've been talking about for these hours, it occurs to me
                    that anyone listening might get a funny idea as to how the Foreign Service
                    worked. Particularly when these same names keep popping up. Fundamentally, I was
                    sort of a junior contemporary of these people. I had been fortunate in all of my
                    time in the Dept., getting promoted, sometimes not as quickly as I thought I
                    should, but sort of making it in a system which really was quite competitive.
                    Simply stated, the selection process for the Foreign Service Officer Corps was,
                    promotion up or selection out, a system frequently likened to the Navy
                    system.</p>
                <p>Every year every officer of every grade was ranked by a selection board of his
                    peers. If you fell in the bottom five percent once, you were warned you were in
                    trouble. If you fell in the bottom five percent twice, you were out. And the FS
                    Act provided for early departure with a pension on which you would probably
                    starve, but that was the system. I would never say the system was perfect, but
                    on the whole it seemed to be fair and equitable, and when you entered the
                    Service, that's the basis on which you accepted your commission. Probably more
                    important in the scheme of things was that over time, even though the
                    organization was relatively small, it was possible to have a variety of
                    assignments through which you could develop good reputation for knowing what you
                    were doing, and a willingness to get in there and push to get the job done. You
                    built up a sort of demand for your services. And frankly I believe I've been
                    very fortunate in that respect.</p>

                        reputation”. You knew who could get things done and were particularly good.
                        I think this, in a way, has a certain amount of meritocracy that has always
                        operated particularly in a small operation. And, of course the higher you
                        get the more this will work and always will work.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>DONELAN: Yes, that is true. Another facet of that is personal relationships or as
                    they say - inter-personal relationships in any career; how you get along with
                    your superiors, your peers and yes, very important - your subordinates. I've
                    mentioned Bill Hall a lot. As a matter of fact over time I learned a lot from my
                    bosses. The budget business in any agency is very demanding. Bill had a great
                    secretary...and for the time when we worked closely together I noticed, every
                    night, and particularly after a tough day, as he was leaving or his secretary
                    was leaving, he would always say “Thanks”. And you know a lot of people in
                    government never say “thanks” - somehow or other they don't think it's
                    necessary, but it is. We've all had them but off-hand I can thing of two
                    dissimilar situations where personal relationships proved their importance.
                    During my time in Nagoya, we got a wire from a ship at sea - it had a smoldering
                    fire in a hold and it was bringing a cargo of small tractors and raw cotton to
                    the Nagoya port. To make it worse one of the ship's crew had gone berserk, and
                    they had to forcibly restrain him. He was a danger to the ship and the few
                    passengers they had, and they wanted to off-load him at Nagoya. After the war
                    the Japanese had re-written their immigration laws, and they had borrowed
                    heavily from the body of American law. You will remember that flat out we
                    prohibit entry into the US of insane persons. The man had tried to set another
                    fire on the ship before he was sedated and locked in his cabin, and the skipper
                    was fearful of the safety of his ship. I checked some of my contacts and found
                    that the only one who might possible be able to help was the District High Judge
                    (in later years he became a Justice of the Japanese Supreme Court). He said “you
                    know what the law is. We've copied your law down.” I said, that I understood
                    that fully, but if I personally take full responsibility myself for this man, he
                    will really not technically have put his foot on Japanese soil, and therefore he
                    technically will not become the responsibility of Japan. He said, “Well, I
                    understand your reasoning, but our law is very, very strict. However, if you
                    will give your personal guarantee that he not stay in Nagoya more than one hour,
                    I would consider that under your personal bond that we could release the man
                    from the ship in your custody.” We arranged to have an airplane at the local
                    airport; when he came off the gangplank we bundled him into the Consulate car;
                    put him on the airplane; he was flown to Yokosuka, and whisked off to the
                    hospital on the American Naval Base. That's one side of personal relationships,
                    which helps get the job done. Another one, a little different involved an
                    incident in India. Under Department regulations when a seriously ill employee is
                    to be evacuated by air, you may send a medical attendant along with the person,
                    usually the Embassy nurse or doctor if there is one, and in extreme cases you
                    may also send two persons. An AID employee was seriously ill and to be medically
                    evacuated to the military hospital in Frankfurt. The Embassy nurse was already
                    away on a trip, the Embassy doctor was himself seriously ill, so we decided to
                    send the man's wife as his medical attendant - something which had been done
                    before. Their little girl, maybe four years old was going to stay with my family
                    (four girls). At the last moment the child panicked and became hysterical at
                    being left behind by her Mother and Father. The flight was waiting at the
                    airport, we had no travel orders, no authority to send the child. So I had
                    orders written and the four year old child became the second medical attendant.
                    For some time after that I guessed that the Department's medical people were
                    very unhappy with me. A couple of weeks later I got a letter from the same
                    William J. Crockett we've been talking about. It was very short. It said “ Dear
                    Joe, why did you do it?</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>So I wrote him a letter back and said, “Dear Bill, if you had been here, you
                    would have done the same thing”. I never heard another word about if.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's the oil that makes the system work in a positive
                        sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: It's like the National War College. The greatest value of the War
                    College to the Department is that in the succeeding years a good number of your
                    class-mates are going to be generals or admirals. That's a fact since the
                    military sent to the National War College are selected on that basis. So the
                    value is that two years later you can call up Charlie, who is now a rear
                    admiral, and you tell him - “We need a medical evacuation plane out of Burma,
                    can you help us? They can help and it sure beats writing a letter through
                    channels. That's what makes the world go round, and sometimes makes it a better
                    place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move on to when you were a comptroller for NATO. How
                        did this assignment come about and what were you doing? This was the
                        assignment of going to Brussels as the NATO Comptroller.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Actually, more specifically, it was Comptroller for Infrastructure. The
                    Infrastructure Program, as the name implies, was the North Atlantic Treaty
                    Organization oversight of all the physical facilities necessary effectively to
                    commit the NATO forces in time of war. It included air fields, docks,
                    warehouses, various communications facilities, missile sites, training
                    facilities, etc. There was an Infrastructure Committee, a standing Committee of
                    the North Atlantic Treaty Council, which had a fourteen nation membership
                    including France, and of which the Comptroller for Infrastructure, was the
                    Chairman. I was actually seconded by the Department to the position, which in
                    itself, was an international civil servant position. (And no, in the case of
                    NATO, by special arrangement, it is not a tax-free position). This was in July
                    of 1968, after three years with ACDA and one year in the Foreign Service
                    Inspection Corps. My staff consisted of both financial and engineering
                    personnel, the latter civilian experts on military facilities, weapons and
                    equipment. I learned something new every day. Understandably the military
                    requirements were determined through the NATO military chain of command, through
                    the NATO Military Committee to the NATO Council for approval. Financial
                    estimates were made as the projects moved up the line for acceptance, and the
                    whole became a projected yearly program ( a tranche) with that year's funding
                    approved by the respective national representatives. As the projects moved
                    forward to final acceptance and contracts they were subject to final engineering
                    and cost review by the Infrastructure Committee, whose members operated under
                    instruction from their own governments. The Comptroller for Infrastructure as
                    the Chairman of the Committee was in a unique position, in that he controlled
                    the agenda of the Committee and the flow of projects past the members, and no
                    project went forward finally without the sign-off of the Infrastructure project
                    engineer. The Committee met all day twice a week in all day sessions listening
                    to engineering studies and hearing presentations by the national representatives
                    as to urgency of their particular projects. Norway for instance might want a new
                    deep water dock in one of the fjords, with all sorts of electronics and
                    provision for submarine nets, etc. Greece could be pressing for a new missile
                    site which was a training site for NATO, and of course there was a lot of back
                    scratching. The Comptroller was sort of in the middle because he had to try to
                    negotiate some of these things out. So you spent as much time outside the
                    council room, on projects as you did in the formal area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of any other examples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: It was simply a way of doing business as anything else, and I suppose
                    this type of thing goes on everyday in the UN and no one thinks anything of it.
                    But it was my first exposure on a multilateral or regional basis. I also noticed
                    over my two years in that assignment that when there was an incident or some
                    kind of international tension going on, some possible emerging threat, everyone
                    became wonderfully more cooperative. When things settled down and were running
                    more smoothly or quietly, the old competitive spirit came right back into play.
                    But don't misunderstand me. This program was real, and I was very proud to be
                    associated with it. It was the most real life thing NATO had going. You can
                    conduct exercises and you can make plans and you can set up targets, but by gosh
                    if you don't have those airfields and bases and sites, you had nothing to launch
                    from and nothing to come back to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving to your last tour with the State Department. You
                        had essentially a series of positions, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Yes, two really.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was starting in '69. What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: The first was Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget and Finance, which
                    was followed by a presidential appointment, Assistant Secretary of State for
                    Administration. However I left NATO with great reluctance personally and amid a
                    bit of a storm. On the one side was George Vest who was Deputy Chief of the US
                    Mission to NATO and Manlio Brosio, a distinguished Italian diplomat, who was
                    Secretary General of NATO, with whom I had developed a good rapport. Brosio was
                    very irritated with the US cutting short my assignment (the job called for a
                    five year assignment) saying that by doing so the Department was belittling the
                    importance of NATO. George Vest supported Brosio, and I cheered unavailingly
                    from the side lines, after having told the Department that I didn't want the
                    assignment, and that I thought I could do more for the US by staying at NATO. I
                    wasn't being simon pure, just that I was having a great time in a fascinating
                    job.</p>
                <p>What happened was that President Nixon came out to Brussels for a heads of state
                    meeting; Frank Meyer who was at the time Assistant Secretary of State for
                    Administration was with him, and I might mention just as a matter of interest,
                    the now Senator from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan was also there in his
                    capacity as an advisor to the President. But anyway, Frank and I were old
                    friends and were having lunch when he told me that his Deputy for Budget and
                    Finance was retiring and he would like me to take the job. I told Frank that I
                    was flattered but I really didn't want to leave NATO. I felt the job was
                    important for a lot of reasons; 39 cents of every dollar in the NATO budget was
                    contributed by the US - and not being partisan, but just being objective I could
                    help to assure that we got our money's worth. The work was interesting; I even
                    had taken one Committee trip where the group was hosted by the German
                    government; we had been helicoptered along the border and then had landed and
                    seen the Iron Curtain first hand. It was a fascinating experience and I was
                    looking forward to other opportunities for travel to NATO countries to see some
                    of these projects first hand. And not the least of it all, for the first time in
                    my foreign experience, someone was giving me administrative support - the
                    Embassy in Brussels. I had a lovely house in a suburb of Brussels, just twenty
                    minutes from the NATO headquarters. The best of all worlds. I almost convinced
                    myself that I had convinced him. Several weeks later I was with my family in
                    Germany, at Garmisch, on a long planned visit, having dinner when the waiter
                    told me I had a phone call -He said “Someone from Washington”!</p>
                <p>So I came back as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget and Finance. It was a
                    pretty busy two years, I thought, and then Frank Meyer retired in the spring of
                    1971.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>It was customary to have a career man in that Assistant Secretary job. It made a
                    lot of sense, not because I got the job, but it did - you knew the Foreign
                    Service as well as the Dept.; you'd been at the posts abroad; you'd experienced
                    the problems of communications and supply and logistics - that's what you had
                    been doing. As a matter of fact the Department of State was quite unique at the
                    time....most of the Assistant Secretaries of State were career officers, in fact
                    had a dual capacity as presidential appointees and career officers (you took the
                    salary of the Assistant Secretary which was greater). A lot of that has changed.
                    In the recent administrations more and more straight out political appointments
                    have been made at that level and in fact there are just a lot more jobs filled
                    by political appointees. We can thank Jimmy Carter for greater politicization in
                    the Executive Branch by pushing the so called Senior Executive Service, and
                    Senior Foreign Service, a movement heartily endorsed and followed by Ronald
                    Reagan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your responsibilities when you were Assistant
                        Secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: The organization chart showed the functions of budget and finance,
                    communications, security, operations (supplies, equipment, transportation), each
                    headed by a Deputy Assistant Secretary and the Office of Foreign Buildings,
                    headed by a Director. The heaviest responsibility was in the budget function,
                    planning, formulation and execution. You were the principal liaison with the
                    members and staff of the Appropriations Committees, on both side of the aisle,
                    House and Senate. Of course before you got to that point you had to work with
                    the Office of Management and Budget, which had an annoyingly arrogant manner of
                    operating, a constant tug of war in which they nit-picked and you pushed to keep
                    intact the monetary magnitude of the budget. In spite of the high sounding
                    things, some very simple things were really important. Like going up to the Hill
                    at least once a week for coffee with the chief clerks of the House and the
                    Senate Appropriations Committees. These men knew each other very well; they were
                    sharp, congenial, and to a large extent they controlled the direction of the
                    Hearings.I was still necessarily interested in the fiscal side, which was less
                    demanding but important in controlling spending and accountability of funds
                    through the apportionment and allotment process. I had learned a long time ago
                    that you always tried to avoid surprises where and how the money was being
                    spent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other things follow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: You've got something there. The second thing was communications. There
                    were tremendous strides in communications in the Department over a period of
                    time. There were some very, very good communication innovations in that period.
                    It was fascinating to see the developments and the money that went into them -
                    but communications were the sine qua non of any world wide operation.
                    Interestingly enough once we got off the dime in arguing for greater
                    communications capability, John Rooney over a several year period supported the
                    increased funding.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>When I was in Delhi, it took all sorts of time just to get a message from India
                    back to the Department. Even by radio, it was a terribly slow process because it
                    went relay, relay, relay. But there were all sorts of sophisticated developments
                    in communication in the 60's and later. This was not only great for substantive
                    operations but also for administration and particularly finance. Later when you
                    could tie your computers into your electronic network you had arrived in the
                    20th century. Operations was the supply function; procurement, shipment,
                    transportation, equipment and maintenance, with probably the biggest headache
                    the world-wide fleet of vehicles which had to be purchased, maintained and
                    operated, with all sorts of funny congressional limitations.Then of course you
                    had the Foreign Buildings Office, responsible for all of the overseas housing
                    and building operations of the Dept., including acquisition of land and
                    construction of new building. There was a man by the name of Fritz Larkin who
                    was in charge of FBO right after WWII. The US had vast credits and surpluses of
                    foreign currencies, which were available for use without appropriation for
                    official purposes. Fritz Larkin traveled far and wide and acquired real property
                    which he paid for in local currencies of the country - and which at the time
                    were almost a drag on the market for any other purpose. At times he was roundly
                    scolded and berated by the Congress, who piously pronounced that the Department
                    of State was not in the real estate business and should cease and desist from
                    such activities. The real fact of the matter is that Larkin did a great service.
                    For years after the US government used the real property acquired for it by
                    Larkin, on which to build the buildings for the burgeoning foreign operations of
                    all kinds. If the land wasn't used directly it was traded and/or
                    sold.....frequently at considerable profits which were permitted to be retained
                    in the no-year appropriation account, for future uses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At one point people in the Foreign Service talked rather
                        disparagingly about FBO, saying this was a creature of Wayne Hayes, who was
                        at that time a very powerful congressman. And it really wasn't a very
                        competent organization. In actuality, how did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>DONELAN: After I retired I was asked, not by FBO but by A, at the time my
                    successor John Thomas was still Assistant Secretary, to come back and do some
                    studies of housing and building requirements in a number of countries overseas.
                    I used to joke about it and say, “Well, I've come back to do this in expiation
                    for the fact that I never did as much as I had hoped that I would do when I was
                    in A, on the foreign building side”. The situation you refer to was not a
                    healthy one. It began to develop after the time of Fritz Larkin - I'd say about
                    in the early '50s. A Foreign Service Officer, was the Director of FBO. He was
                    outspoken and determined and stubborn and very knowledgeable all in one, and
                    really took a stand with the Committee (of which I believe Wayne Hayes was
                    Chairman at the time). He bullied Bill Hughes and Bill wouldn't be bullied.
                    Hayes called off the Hearings and said there would be no Hearings and no FBO
                    appropriation, in effect, until Bill Hughes was moved. It was not a great moment
                    for the Department of State. And over time there were other such moments. The
                    personal challenge which I guess every responsible officer faced sometime or
                    more often in his career, was to his personal standards and the point at which
                    his own self respect kept him on the course of action he knew was right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was in it for him, Wayne Hayes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: It was a power thing. This happens to these people, sort of an exercise
                    in power.(Like Senator Helms nowadays who will hold up career appointments for
                    the most outrageous and trivial reasons.) He controlled the authorization bill
                    for the Office of Foreign Buildings - which strangely enough was separate and
                    apart from the regular authorization and appropriation acts which funded all
                    other State Department activities.He was a tyrant in his own way, and as I
                    recall in later years he also was in charge of Administration in the House and
                    made himself obnoxious to his peers in the House. Controlling the overall level
                    of funding and the authorization level for new buildings abroad, gave him a
                    marvelous reason for traveling abroad almost whenever he wanted to, and he loved
                    it, and I will be eternally grateful that I never had the chore of accompanying
                    him abroad.</p>
                <p>Once he forced the issue with one FBO Director, for the rest of his time in
                    Congress, he insisted and at least influenced the selection of the Director.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>I had one classic experience with the man. The then Director of FBO wrote me a
                    paper and said that he wanted to revise the long term leases of four or five of
                    the US Consulate buildings in Mexico. These leases were for more than ten years,
                    and as I recall maybe three or four years had gone by on them, and now he's
                    recommending they be revised, upward, naturally. These buildings had all been
                    built by a contractor who was at least an acquaintance of Wayne Hayes. I never
                    did know who made the decision or when to have them constructed with the
                    commitment to long term lease these buildings. It was more the practice of the
                    Department to construct and own rather than long term lease. I just sent the
                    memo back with the note that” they should show me some proof and justification
                    as to why these leases needed to be revised, or rewritten because of change in
                    fact or circumstance or additional performance by the owner which might justify
                    the change”. And if they could I would take another look.</p>
                <p>So the next day I got a phone call from the Congressman's Office - he'd like to
                    see me. What a coincidence!</p>
                <p>I'm a great believer in regulations, simply because regulations are made to be
                    changed, they simply are interpretations of the law, and the better you knew
                    them, the more you could make them work for you. There was a finding which had
                    been made some years earlier by the Comptroller General on contracts and
                    revision of contracts. I put a copy in my pocket and went up to see the
                    Chairman. And I sat there for thirty minutes listening.</p>
                <p>I was listening and thinking to myself.”I don't like this guy, but he's a very
                    smart man, I know what he wants, but if anyone was taping this conversation,
                    they'd be hard put to prove that he was twisting my arm to authorize revision of
                    the leases. He told me how patriotic the man was; how he had dual American and
                    Mexican citizenship, and how he had been in the American Army during World War
                    II. I told him I understood and realized what the problem was, but that I was
                    constrained by a Comptroller General's decision - and the justification I had
                    heard from my staff unfortunately could not meet the CG's requirement. I gave
                    him a copy of the ruling, but as I recall he didn't even look at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You reached into your pocket and showed your
                        regulation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Actually his regulation, since the Comptroller General reports to the
                    Congress. I knew he was furious with me, but he never showed it. He wasn't about
                    to. But I didn't hear any more on the subject for some time. I guess that must
                    have been around December of '72.</p>
                <p>I retired from the Department in April 1973. At the end of that summer I was in
                    New York having gone to work for the Institute of International Education, when
                    I received a phone call from the Foreign Service Inspectors. And they said.:
                    Hey, Joe, we were doing an inspection in the Department of FBO, and we saw this
                    thing where all these leases down in Mexico had been revised.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>And I said, “You What”!</p>
                <p>And they said, “ Yes we saw where all the leases had been changed and signed.”
                    But they said, “ But we don't understand this, because in going through the
                    files we found a memorandum which was written to you last December or November
                    and it was from the head of FBO to the Assistant Secretary A and across the top
                    there were two words. It said 'Hell, no! And your initials. And now here next
                    September or October of the following year, it's all done”. And they said, “ We
                    don't understand that.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, unfortunately, I think I do. I retired from the Department in
                    April 1973”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the time when we were beginning to
                        phase out during the Vietnam War. Did this have any effect on what you were
                        doing? Or did you have much to do with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: No. That essentially was handled as a special entity. The Cords program,
                    recruitment, training, operation, all special budgets and special funding. We
                    got into things occasionally on the fringes - on occasional problems on which we
                    were expected to help out. But fundamentally no, although it was an integral
                    part of the Department of State operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there the Deputy Under Secretary for
                        Management was William Macomber, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Yes, that's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was he as a leader as far as you were concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Well, Bill is a very, very intense man. Do you know him yourself?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just knew him vaguely.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>DONELAN: As a matter of fact, we talked about Wayne Hayes, and that incident I
                    told you about Hayes. Bill called me shortly after that and he said, “Oh, by the
                    way, if there's any topics to be taken up with Wayne Hayes, let me know, I can
                    take care of him. Why don't you just let me handle him from now on”. So, I
                    said,”Fine, suits me fine”. As a practical matter I don't know of anything that
                    came up with Hayes in my remaining time, I retired in April 1973, as I had
                    planned (age 55). and shortly thereafter Bill went off somewhere as Ambassador.
                    I don't believe I ever met anyone who worked harder than Macomber. When he first
                    got the job sometime before I returned to the Department he knew very little
                    about budgets. When I first returned from Brussels that was my principal area of
                    responsibility and we had some very intensive sessions. There are a lot of
                    technicalities in budgeting and there's a lot of gobbledygook, and there's a lot
                    of bureaucratic terms, regulations, OMB, Treasury requirements, etc. He had a
                    lot to learn. He'd call me up on a Sunday afternoon before a hearing and we
                    would talk on the phone for hours, going into this and that, and what is that
                    and why. And then we used to have regular sessions at 7:00 in the morning to get
                    ready for Budget Hearings.</p>
                <p>Actually I had a feeling of some disappointment in the last couple of years in
                    the Department I believe, in retrospect that Macomber didn't want any great
                    initiatives from the Assistant Secretary. In other words, whatever was done, he
                    was going to do it. I don't know if you've interviewed him or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eventually, we hope to. One other question dealing with
                        the relationships, we were talking about at lunch, and I would like you to
                        mention a little here about Graham Martin because Graham Martin was our last
                        Ambassador to Saigon, and a very controversial person, particularly his
                        method of operation within the Foreign Service context. I would like to have
                        your impressions when you dealt with him. This is going back. But whenever
                        you dealt with him.</hi>

                <p>DONELAN: I had and have the highest regard for Graham Martin, and the greatest
                    respect for his great talent. I believe I had an excellent background and
                    considerable experience in administration when I went to Paris, but I was brand
                    new in the Foreign Service. Graham was Counselor of Embassy for Administrative
                    Affairs for the Embassy, and uniquely also had some regional European
                    responsibility, as well. I watched that man for a number of years, and worked
                    with him very, very closely, and my admiration for him has never been
                    diminished. A lot of people have said that he was aloof, even a cold fish, which
                    was a rather harsh way to put it. He might have given that impression. But he
                    wasn't. He was distant; he usually was very precise, always soft spoken, always
                    courteous; was very firm and could be cutting, but when he was, on reflection,
                    you could be sure that it was justified - in fact I would say, probably
                    calculated. No question but he was a complicated person.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I recall one incident which occurred some time before I arrived at the Embassy
                    involving a foreign service inspection. As I understand it the Inspector had
                    very harshly rated one of the Embassy employees, a secretary I believe. Martin
                    evidently did not agree with the assessment, protested the action, and fought it
                    all the way back to the Director General, and won. During my time another
                    inspection was announced, and it fell to me as Budget &amp; Management Officer
                    to shape things up for the coming exercise. I really worked hard at it. And one
                    day he said to me, “If you were an inspector or five inspectors and you came to
                    Paris for five weeks and if you spent all that time inspecting or a third of
                    that time inspecting, or a fourth of the time inspecting the administrative
                    operation (one of the biggest in the world) and you didn't find anything wrong
                    with the place, you'd be mad as hell. In fact you might even be a little
                    disappointed. In fact you might be so disappointed you might have to find
                    something to criticize!” In effect he was saying, relax, don't get so up tight
                    about it, nothing's perfect. In those couple of years I learned a lot of things
                    which I used from those days forward for the rest of my career. I'm sure however
                    I was never so audacious as he was.</p>
                <p>Another thing, he knew the local employees, the foreign nationals. They knew him.
                    There were a lot of young Americans who were afraid of him. But the local
                    employees were not afraid of him. He knew where everything was; where the power
                    lines came into the chancery basement; how many gallons the Embassy emergency
                    water storage tank held, all the vital statistics on the building which might be
                    necessary in an emergency. Ever after whenever I walked down the hall of embassy
                    or consular building my eye automatically recorded whether or not that fire
                    extinguisher was up to date and had been inspected within the last year. Have
                    you ever noticed the inspection cards on the wall of an elevator? He did many
                    things far away and above what an ordinary counselor of embassy for
                    administration would do. And when I say extraordinary I also mean the way he
                    worked with the Ambassador on matters of substance, in France and with several
                    other of the European Ambassadors. I learned from him that when you are in
                    charge and you are the administrative officer you better know your physical
                    plant and you better get out and see people and you better look the place over
                    yourself. You must do this assiduously. And I've noticed over the years
                    administrative people who let themselves get snowed under, chained to the desk,
                    never get out, and pretty soon there are little bits of the place falling down
                    around them.</p>
                <p>I also learned how he played on the Department, and I must confess that at times
                    I've used the same ploy. The circumstance is something which needs to get done
                    locally but the Department is really not terribly excited about, but you need to
                    clear it with them. Something like - putting washing machines in the Marine
                    Guard quarters. You send a cable to the Department and you tell them you must
                    have an answer by Tuesday. And you know damn well that they are going to take at
                    least fifteen days to answer you. But you say,” If I don't get an answer by
                    Tuesday, I'm going ahead and do it.” And of course, no one ever reads that line.
                    So then you go ahead and do it. If someone says something later on, and they
                    usually don't, you say, “I told you I had to have it by such and such a date.”
                    This type of upmanship is a little nasty, but sometimes it was necessary dealing
                    with the Department.”</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Or a more pertinent instance, you knew that you were within three months of the
                    Department giving you your allocation of funding or staffing for the next year -
                    you sat down and you wrote the best justification, argumentation, updated
                    workload statistics, data, rationale, ambassador support, for this job or that
                    job, or special funding. And it landed on the desks in Washington, just when
                    they're trying to figure out how much can we cut them? Throws them off balance a
                    bit, but it's very hard for them to ignore you at that time, particularly if you
                    have tried to make sense in all your submissions the rest of the year. These are
                    little techniques and they are used in every business. On the personnel side,
                    you learned to take care of the junior officer. If they're with you a couple of
                    years and they don't get promoted and you think they should have been, that they
                    have not been treated fairly, you go to bat for them.</p>
                <p>Finally, I've not seen Graham for a number of years, and I know his health has
                    failed considerably. He never wrote the story of those years in Vietnam. I wish
                    that he had. I dearly wish that he had because essentially it ended up sort of
                    being in a cloud, a question mark about some of the things that he did. I know
                    that he was never popular with our military, in Bangkok where he also was
                    Ambassador and in Vietnam. That I understand because sometimes military fervor
                    overtakes common sense, and I know Graham stood his ground with the country
                    commanders on more than one occasion. He would remind them rather archly, that
                    he was the personal representative of the President of the United States in that
                    country and not they. I don't know if for very high political reasons things
                    didn't come out. I just don't know what the answer is. He was at the end of his
                    career, he was very ill when he was evacuated from Saigon. But I'm steadfast in
                    my respect and admiration for him and his tremendous ability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the end of these interviews there are two questions
                        they ask. First, what do you feel that you're most pleased with having done
                        or accomplished? It doesn't have to be a big thing, but just something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: I think that I will give you two little things, one I've already
                    mentioned. Even though I personally didn't carry it to it's highest level, I
                    think I am proudest of the Regional Finance Center in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Paris, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: It was a great satisfaction to me to see it burgeon over the years in
                    size and importance, and become a permanent adjunct of Foreign Service
                    administrative operation.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>And the second thing, which was probably my greatest thrill - was one day to find
                    myself - standing in a Buddhist temple in Nagoya - the monks in their robes, the
                    picture of the deceased on the altar, the traditional rice cakes, tapers lit,
                    incense burning, and a large number of people - but no other gaijin present!</p>
                <p>As was the custom for very prominent members of the community, the Governor of
                    the Prefecture, the Mayor of the City, the President of the Chamber of Commerce,
                    were called upon to eulogize the deceased. And then it way my turn. And this was
                    the greatest compliment I could possibly have received; being asked by a
                    Japanese to give a eulogy in Japanese, for a Japanese. I said early on, even tho
                    selected for the principal officer slot in Nagoya, that I was not a Language
                    Officer, that is I had never had Foreign Service Institute training in Japanese.
                    However for almost every day of my three years plus in Japan, I took a language
                    lesson in the early morning. A good part of my job was to be present at all
                    sorts of plant openings and other festive occasions. Frequently, more so at
                    first, I'd get myself in trouble - since the conclusion was that the Ryoji-san
                    was fluent in Japanese. He wasn't. He just worked like a dog on some of these
                    speeches - and I figured out over time that it took me three hours of work at
                    night with a tape recorder to give a good three minute speech in Japanese. Once
                    committed to do it, it had to be right. So that's what I'm proudest of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is something to be proud of. The final question is,
                        how do you feel about the Foreign Service as a career to a young person
                        coming up? Would you recommend it looking at it today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DONELAN: Well I'm of a mixed mind. A career in the Foreign Service is not like
                    having a job, it's a very personal thing - it's a way of life. It will never in
                    itself make you wealthy (money), but it gives you a richness in living which
                    otherwise you might never experience. But what's in it for me seems to dominate
                    a large segment of society today, so if that's where you fit, then the Service
                    is not for you. For others, my answer would be an emphatic yes, and maybe I
                    should just leave it there.</p>
                <p>But so much depends on the attitude of the person involved - and the Foreign
                    Service as a segment of society does in fact reflect the nuances and changes in
                    the society as a whole. To illustrate for about eight years I did a series of
                    special projects which brought me overseas (to eleven countries). I was in
                    Tehran just a couple a months before that fell apart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is after you retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>DONELAN: Yes. Immediately after I retired I went to work for the Institute of
                    International Education in New York, as VP for Administration - and enjoyed four
                    years with the organization, took a long vacation and then at the request of
                    John Thomas, who was my successor as Assistant Secretary, undertook to head a
                    series of studies known as the AMAT, Administrative Management Advisory Team
                    studies. But that's not the point. In visiting the various countries I was
                    struck by the difference in attitudes of the Embassy staffs.</p>
                <p>One of the Embassies visited was New Delhi, and remember the focus of these
                    studies was housing and office space requirements and developments of master
                    plans for each post. Delhi as a post has a very substantial number of housing
                    units in the compound area, plus fairly attractive housing in the best parts of
                    town. It seemed that everyone was pressing to live in the Compound - the golden
                    ghetto, which had it's own ball field, swimming pool, commissary, restaurant,
                    small hospital. No one appeared to be pushing to live out on the economy - even
                    away from the Compound. In conversations over the several weeks, the subjects
                    which pushed most everything else aside was mostly about - cost of living, pay
                    raises, post allowances, what will my next post be - and the Embassy Compound
                    seemed to be the focal point of social activity. In my years in Delhi it was a
                    quite different focus. People did not want to live in the Compound, the idea was
                    to get out and see the country, vacation in a houseboat in Kashmir, visit odd
                    places, see what the people were like, savor the history around you.</p>
                <p>This was a not uncommon set of impressions at the posts visited, although
                    obviously there were different gradations depending on the specific conditions
                    of the country. For instance in Nairobi which had excellent housing - there was
                    unquestionably turmoil in the local situation, which was threatening and in all
                    fairness in some areas the specter of terrorism had to have a pervasive
                    influence. This all comes out probably harsher than the reality, but even back
                    off a few notches and the exaggeration is not too great. But the basic fact is
                    that a person's attitude is extremely important to success in a foreign service
                    career.</p>
                <p>And of course one long standing statistic still stands....every year for as long
                    as I can remember, and I heard it quoted again just in the last week or so, the
                    Foreign Service receives approximately twenty-four thousand applications each
                    year. This, whether the US economy is good, bad or indifferent; almost
                    incredible when you realize that each year only a relatively few of the original
                    candidates are accepted into the Service. And the final note - a survey of my
                    contemporaries, almost all retired now, would result in a statement that,” We
                    wouldn't trade our experiences for anything”.</p>
