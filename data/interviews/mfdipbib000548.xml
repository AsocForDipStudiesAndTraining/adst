                <p>AMBASSADOR KARL F. INDERFURTH</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial Interview date: April 27, 2001</p>
                <p>Copyright 2003 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: Today is April 27, 2001. This is an interview with Ambassador Karl F.
                    Inderfurth. We're going to start at the beginning. When and where were you born?
                    Tell me a bit about your family.</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: First of all, although formally Karl F. for “Frederick,” I'm known as
                    “Rick.” People say there is a Rick Inderfurth, but they don't know Karl. I'm
                    actually both.</p>
                <p>I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina in September 1946 and grew up there. My
                    father was Karl Henry Inderfurth from Mystic, Connecticut. My mother, Sarah
                    Frances Seawell, was from Rockingham, North Carolina. My father's parents had
                    both immigrated from Germany in the early 1900s. Grandfather was from Breyell.
                    That was in the northwest part of the country toward Belgium. My grandmother
                    came from a small town in that vicinity, Lubberich. They did not know each other
                    when they came to this country. They met in Connecticut, in Mystic, where
                    Grandfather had come to be a superintendent at a textile plant, Rossie Velvet,
                    which is now just across the street from the Mystic Seaport Museum. There was a
                    German-American community there. He met his wife, Anna, and got married. She was
                    very pleased to be the wife of a successful manager at this textile plant. Then
                    my grandfather decided that he wanted to be a farmer, so she had to quickly
                    adjust herself to becoming a farmer's wife. They bought a farm outside of
                    Mystic, where my father was born and raised and lived until it was time for him
                    to go to college. He decided he would go into textiles, as my Grandfather had
                    originally come to America to do. But textiles was moving south, so Dad went to
                    Clemson College, which was then a military school in Clemson, South Carolina, to
                    get his degree in textile engineering. That's how he made his way south where he
                    met my mother. She was at the Women's College at the University of North
                    Carolina at Greensboro. They got married after Dad graduated from Clemson and
                    they later moved to Charlotte, where I was born.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have brothers or sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: One sister, Pamela, who was born in Philadelphia in 1943. My father
                    at that point was in the service. He was eventually a major in the Army in the
                    Quartermaster Corps. He was stationed in Philadelphia at that time, where my
                    sister was born.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you grow up in Charlotte?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sit around the table at night and talk about
                        things owas this a workaholic family where everybody went their own
                        way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I think at that time families got together more for dinner than
                    today. I remember we ate dinner every night at 6:00 on the dot. Dad, being a
                    textile representative, did a lot of traveling. So, during the week, he was
                    often on the road traveling to various textile plants in North and South
                    Carolina, Georgia, Virginia. At that time he was a vice president of Collins
                    Brothers Machinery Company in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. At one point early in my
                    life, we lived in Rhode Island for a couple of years while he was working with
                    Collins Brothers. Eventually, he branched out to return to his parents' roots,
                    Germany, to expand his business in textiles. My Dad spoke German in his home in
                    Mystic until World War I and the U.S. entry into the war in 1917. At that point
                    his parents said, “We will not speak German any longer in the home. We're going
                    to become Americanized.” Obviously there was strong anti-German feeling in
                    Connecticut and elsewhere because of the war. Later when Dad decided to do
                    business in Germany, his German came back almost fluently. He tried to convince
                    my sister and myself to learn German from him. Unfortunately, we had no clue why
                    we would ever need a foreign language. We had no international exposure in
                    Charlotte. That is one of the regrets of my life that I didn't take up my Dad's
                    offer. I could have certainly used it in what for me became a very international
                    life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My mother spoke German before she spoke English, but it
                        didn'pass on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Well, it is a regret that I have that I didn't do that. Interestingly
                    enough, I've been to Germany many times and most recently just a few weeks ago
                    when I was in Berlin for a Track II diplomatic meeting sponsored by the UN on
                    Afghanistan. I looked in the phone book and once again found several
                    Inderfurths. The only place that I've ever traveled where I can find my namesake
                    in a phone book is in Berlin. There was a Werner Inderfurth, a Klaus Inderfurth
                    and a Karl Inderfurth among others. I am connected with some of them. But, for
                    me, the fact that Dad started making trips to Europe opened up a little bit of
                    the world that I had not seen as a Charlottean. Some of Dad's business contacts
                    from Germany started coming to Charlotte. Dad also traveled to Latin America, to
                    Colombia. We started on occasion having red wine with dinner, which was sort of
                    a European thing to do. All this was the beginning of a little more
                    international flavor in my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For yourself, what about reading? Did this grab you early
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: No, it actually didn't. I regret to say that I did not become a real
                    reader until college. Maybe that's good. By the time I got the bug, I never let
                    go of it. I still am a very avid reader. But in high school - I went to Myers
                    Park High in Charlotte - I think I was more interested in athletics. I was
                    captain of the swimming team and we were state champions and I played football
                    my senior year and we were ranked very high in the state. I was a very average
                    student, but good enough to get into the University of North Carolina at Chapel
                    Hill. As an in-state student, it was far easier than being an out of state
                    student.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But still, it's one of our premier educational
                        institutions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I did not fully appreciate that at the time. I later learned after I
                    left Chapel Hill and came to Washington what an excellent reputation Chapel Hill
                    had. Of course, it is one of the premier state universities in the country. And
                    while I was there lightbulbs started to go off for me, especially with a few
                    professors like Bernard Boyd in religion, Herbert Bodman in history, and Joel
                    Schwartz in Soviet studies. Also, I began to read “The New York Times” when I
                    was in Chapel Hill, and the columns of James Reston and Tom Wicker. This was at
                    the time that the Vietnam War was becoming quite prominent in the news. Walter
                    Cronkite was on every night on CBS and watching him became a rather permanent
                    fixture of my university existence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the class of what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I graduated in '68. So, I was '64-'68. Of course, that was the major
                    part of the Vietnam buildup and the beginning of the anti-war protests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in college, did you have a major?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Well, I went there to major in business. My father was in business
                    and therefore I simply assumed that I would go off to get my education and get a
                    business degree. Now my Dad never tried to persuade me to go into business but I
                    assumed that that's what I would do. But I also had a roommate from Charlotte by
                    the name of Bart Mauldin. We had agreed to room together our freshman year. He
                    also had a father in business in Charlotte. I think he was oriented in that
                    direction. After the first semester, Bart came back from class one day and said
                    that he had decided that he was going to switch his focus and major in French. I
                    said, “What are you going to do with French? Are you going to teach? Why are you
                    doing this?” He said, “Well, because I like it and I'm interested in it.” I
                    think that was our first and only argument our freshman year. I told him that
                    this was ridiculous and that he had to be more practical. By the end of my
                    freshman year, I had switched my major to political science, which probably had
                    as much practical sense! What do you do with political science?</p>
                <p>I had had my first political science course my second semester, a large lecture
                    class. Professor William Geer taught it. It was introduction to American
                    government. It really was fascinating, hearing how the government worked and
                    about current events in Washington. Professor Geer said at his first lecture: “A
                    requirement of this course is to read a newspaper and I do not mean 'The Hickory
                    Chronicle.' I want you to read 'The New York Times.' It is available and I want
                    you to be well informed.” So, by the end of my freshman year, I went into
                    political science and never looked back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With your father in the textile business, did you get any
                        feelinfor labor problems, integration, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Interesting question. I do not remember at lot of social or political
                    discussion at home. It's not that we avoided it. It just didn't come up at any
                    length. When I was a high school junior, the first black student came to Myers
                    Park High, which was considered one of the top four high schools in the state.
                    There was no violence, nor was there a lot of discussion about this at my home.
                    Later Charlotte got very involved in school desegregation and court-ordered
                    busing.</p>
                <p>My parents were Eisenhower Republicans. We had a very long-time serving member of
                    Congress, Charles R. Jonas, a moderate Republican. My father had some dealings
                    with him. Dad was very involved in the service clubs in Charlotte. He was
                    president of the Lions Club and was a Scout leader. Later he became a “Knight of
                    the Queen City,” which is what Charlotte was called, for his work. Mother was
                    involved in a number of social and charitable activities, a lot of them
                    revolving around the country club, which was a fixture of Charlotte life.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>When I went to college and started coming home from this “liberal bastion” Chapel
                    Hill, I started bringing home my thoughts and reactions to eventabout Vietnam,
                    about the civil rights movement. In this connection I have always found it
                    fascinating that it was my father who first told me that Vietnam was a major
                    mistake. He said he could not for the life of him understand what we were doing
                    there and why we were sending all these young men to that part of the world.
                    This was before the anti-war protests started building up steam. I don't think
                    he said that simply because he had a son that would be of draft age. It wasn't,
                    “Son, I don't want you to go.” That wasn't part of his discussion. He just
                    looked at the situation and asked why are we spilling our blood and treasure
                    there, what U.S. interests are being served. He arrived at the conclusion,
                    earlier than most, that we were making a big mistake.</p>
                <p>Q: When you were taking political science, did you find yourself moving towards
                    state affairs, national affairs, international affairs or was it the whole
                    thing?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: It was a little bit of the whole thing, but there is no doubt that
                    the courses that I remember most were in the international affairs arena. I took
                    a course on the Soviet system by Joel Schwartz. I think he was a graduate
                    student at that point, soon to become a Ph.D. and have a long career at Chapel
                    Hill. I took a course from a Dr. Andrew Scott, who had been a former U.S.
                    government official. I think he served in State, maybe Policy Planning. He was a
                    very distinguished man. I took a course on China and had a chance during a
                    symposium to sit next to Edgar Snow, the author of the classic account of the
                    revolution “Red Star Over China.” He was one of the speakers. Also, because of
                    the Vietnam War, we were all reading “The Ugly American,” Bernard Fall's works
                    on the nature of this conflict, and newspaper articles by those covering the
                    war, like David Halberstam of “The New York Times.” A bit later we had “The
                    Pentagon Papers” to read. So I was moving in an international direction,
                    although I was quite interested in American government, including the presidency
                    and Congress and how they worked.</p>
                <p>While political science was my major, I also had what in effect was a minor in
                    religion. We had a very strong religion department at UNC and an excellent
                    professor by the name of Bernard Boyd, who taught Old and New Testament. His
                    classes were literally sold out, with over 200 students. In high school, I had
                    been part of Young Life, a youth religious group led by a very dynamic leader,
                    Mal McSwain. The religion courses at Chapel Hill were a continuation of that
                    interest of mine, including those that went into ethics. People were becoming
                    more politically active and searching for answers and social values. It was a
                    very fascinating time to be a student studying both politics and religion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think so. North Carolina has always been somewhat
                        thmaverick of the South.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: When I was growing up there, many considered it the mosprogressive
                    state of the South.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Q: But at the same time, there is a strong military tradition there. So, I would
                    have thought that... Could you talk about your observation of the protest
                    movement while you were there?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: One of the strongest memories I have was going to see a demonstration
                    where students and people from Chapel Hill were protesting a Speakers Ban which
                    the legislature in Raleigh had imposed in '65 to prohibit communists or
                    communist-affiliated people from speaking on state university grounds. There was
                    a protest against this and for free speech. The university campus and the town
                    come together on Franklin Street, and there is a small stonewall there. One of
                    the two “communist” labeled speakers that day was Herbert Aptheker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was at the University of San Diego, sort of the guru
                        othe... I'm not even sure he was communist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: People thought he was. I remember standing on the campus side of this
                    stonewall and these two speakers were on the other side on the sidewalk, the
                    town side, and they were speaking to a group of 20-30 people. I'm not even sure
                    if I went there intentionally or just ran into it. But I said, “Now, this is
                    really interesting. What could these people be saying that could be so
                    detrimental to people hearing it when we do believe in free speech in this
                    country?” That didn't make me into a campus activist, which I was not, but it
                    certainly caused me to think about this. There were also beginning to be some
                    anti-war protests, quiet vigils, at the post office at Chapel Hill every
                    Saturday. Often, these were townspeople as well as students, not large numbers.
                    This was in '65 and early '66.</p>
                <p>I also became aware during this time about the view of Chapel Hill being a
                    “liberal oasis” in the state of North Carolina. In fact, I heard it directly
                    from a radio broadcaster in Raleigh who often took to the airways to condemn
                    what was taking place in Chapel Hill. His name was Jesse Helms, who later became
                    chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a leader of the
                    conservative wing of the Republican party.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>I also learned about Chapel Hill's traditions and its great leaders, including
                    Frank Porter Graham, who served in the late 1940s as president of the university
                    and later a U.S. senator and who worked for the United Nations. Later, I learned
                    that he was one of the first UN mediators for the Kashmir conflict. In my later
                    professional experience at State, I was very much involved in Kashmir, so I read
                    a lot about Frank Graham. He was and still is considered one of the greatest of
                    UNC's presidents. He was strong willed, politically courageous, and refused to
                    play the 'race card' in his Senate campaign and lost. He is a key part of that
                    North Carolina progressive tradition that we discussed earlier, which also
                    includes former governor and U.S. senator Terry Stanford and, more recently,
                    Gov. Jim Hunt. So, North Carolina has a strong progressive streak, which I
                    consider myself a part of, but it has also had some far more conservative
                    political figures like Jesse Helms.</p>
                <p>Q: You graduated in '68. This was the peak of American commitment there. How did
                    that play by the time of your senior year, the protest movement? What were you
                    doing?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: By '67/'68, the war was dominating the news. Everybody would make
                    time to watch the CBS News with Walter Cronkite. Chapel Hill, despite being
                    criticized as 'liberal oasis,' was still relatively quiet. But here was
                    beginning to be a lot of discussion about the war. For me, the moment when I
                    started to “take a stand” came in the '68 presidential campaign. That's when the
                    war, and President Johnson's handling of it, became THE national political
                    issue. I remember the first time that I ever politically committed myself was
                    when I volunteered to be an organizer for Eugene McCarthy, who had gone into New
                    Hampshire primary to take on Lyndon Johnson. I put a McCarthy bumper sticker on
                    the back of my Mustang. I was a member of a fraternity, Beta Theta Pi. There
                    weren't that many at that time. But certainly a lot of my fraternity brothers
                    and classmates were becoming more politically active. The hair was getting
                    longer. More people were smoking marijuana. Not a lot of protests on campus, but
                    some. People were beginning to realize that this was a BIG issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much feedback at that time from guys who had
                        graduatethe year or two before and ended up in the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Not much. A number of them continued to go to graduate school, where
                    deferments were possible. No one that I was aware of had gone off to war and
                    come back in a body bag.</p>
                <p>Q: That's one of the ironies of that war, that Johnson had made almost a deal
                    that the small town kids, farm kids, and the black kids... and the more
                    educated...</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: That's right. Some people began to go into reserve units, which I did
                    later. But the war itself was becoming the dominant issue. Of course, when
                    Johnson withdrew from the presidential race, that was a major event. Nobody had
                    expected him to pull out. Robert Kennedy then got involved, but I stayed with
                    McCarthy since he had come in first. I didn't take part in the so-called
                    “Children's Crusade” that went off to New Hampshire and later to the Chicago
                    convention. Before that convention, of course, there was the tragedy of Robert
                    Kennedy being killed, and Martin Luther King. It seemed to be a great unraveling
                    of our national unity, with the war and assassinations. All of this had a very
                    powerful impact on me and many in my generation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you pointed towards in the summer of '68?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: At that point, I was becoming more politically active. I was still
                    very involved in my studies. My last two years, my grades went up considerably,
                    As and Bs. I was looking toward continuing my studies. The opportunity came up
                    to go to Duke Divinity School. I was also getting married that summer. The
                    curriculum at Duke was one that was very interesting to me because it combined
                    social theology, modern ethics, world religion, and a focus on theologians such
                    as Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Reinhold Niebuhr and Walter Rauschenbusch.ADuke, my
                    political interests intervened. There was an internship offered at the Divinity
                    School for students to go into the “real world” - business, political work at
                    the state or national level for a year. They offered a program in Washington to
                    work in the U.S. Senate. I went up and interviewed and was chosen for the
                    program. I was assigned to Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin. So, after that
                    first year at Duke, I came to Washington to do a year internship. I did that,
                    got totally involved in my work and interested in everything that was happening
                    in Washington and decided to withdraw from Duke at the end of the year and stay.
                    That's how I made the transition from there to here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing as an intern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Well, first, Senator Proxmire was a remarkable man - hardworking,
                    honest and he had a thing about the taxpayer's money. There should be no
                    government waste and he would uncover it if there were. Later, he became known
                    for his Golden Fleece awards in which he called attention to $200 toilet seats
                    for the Pentagon and other procurement misuses of the taxpayer's money. He was
                    also very focused on the “Military- Industrial Complex,” which President
                    Eisenhower had called attention to in his Farewell Address. While I was there,
                    Senator Proxmire had a book published on that subject, “Report from Wasteland.”
                    He had been very influenced by another senator, a great senator, Paul Douglas of
                    Illinois, who was a steward of fiscal responsibility.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Proxmire also was opposed to the war in Vietnam and he had me work on some
                    legislation. His office was very good about this because it would give interns
                    right out of college a chance to work on legislation. We also had to the run the
                    mimeograph machine and do all the things that interns dlike opening the mail. He
                    also allowed us to write speeches. He gave a speech a day on the UN Human Rights
                    Conventions and the need to ratify the Genocide Convention among others. That
                    kept us junior staff members busy. He also proposed legislation to stop sending
                    draftees to Vietnam. It was defeated but it was something that I got to work on.
                    All of this was a way for me to channel my concern about the war into political
                    activity at a very high level. There were also demonstrations at that time,
                    marches around the White House with candles, that I took part in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the staff structure at that time
                        in thSenate? It's become almost a fourth branch of government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I certainly realized for the first time the importance of Senate
                    staff. A lot of networking goes on. I've kept in touch with many of the people I
                    first met when I worked for Senator Proxmire. John Holum was Senator McGovern's
                    staff person on defense and foreign policy. John later introduced me to the
                    McGovern presidential campaign and one of its managers, Gary Hart, who hired me
                    as an advance man. Later, John worked with me at the State Department under
                    President Clinton as Under Secretary for Security and Arms Control. There were
                    others I first met at that time, like Bill Miller with Senator Mathias. I later
                    worked with Bill on the Senate Intelligence Committee when he was Staff
                    Director. Later he became our first ambassador to Ukraine after the Soviet Union
                    broke up. So, certainly there was a recognition on my part that staff to members
                    of Congress have enormous responsibilities themselves. But again, for me as an
                    intern, it was a chance to start meeting people and working with them on a
                    variety of issues and it is one that, in many respects, has quite literally
                    carried through to this day.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think that Senator Proxmire going for waste, fraud, and abuse sounds
                    great, but when you think about it, one person's waste to another person is
                    their patronage. I would think that this wouldn't make him terribly popular in
                    the Senate.</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: No, not always in Washington, but it made him popular in Wisconsin,
                    where citizens felt he was protecting their interests. Certainly when he took on
                    defense contractorfor instance, Lockheed and the large overruns on the C-5Athere
                    were a few members of the Senate who did not see eye to eye with Bill
                    Proxmire!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's still going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Yes. He had a lot of whistle blowers who would come to see him.
                    Ernest Fitzgerald was a key figure in his book on the military-industrial
                    complex. But Proxmire was respected because he got his facts right. He also got
                    a lot of publicity. We ran a press release off almost every day. Proxmire also
                    had a prot�g� in a House member from Wisconsin by the name of Les Aspin. Aspin
                    copied the Proxmire approach in the House. He later became Armed Services
                    Committee chairman and later Defense Secretary under President Clinton. Proxmire
                    had a lot of influence on a lot of people, including myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you finished this year, were you looking at where to
                        go anwhat to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I had to make a decision about whether or not to return to Duke and
                    continue my degree there, which would have been a Master's in Divinity, or stay
                    in Washington. Quite frankly, the interest and the excitement of Washington led
                    me to write a letter to Duke and say that I would not be coming back and I asked
                    Senator Proxmire if it would be possible to continue working for him. He hired
                    me as a staff assistant. I stayed on for another year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time, your wife had graduate from UNC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: She had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did she think about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: She liked Washington. She was working for the Census Bureau. After a
                    time, we started moving apart in terms of our interests and we later divorced. A
                    few years after that I remarried and have had a wonderful 24 years with my wife
                    Merrie and our two daughters, Ashley and Alison. I also have a daughter from my
                    previous marriage, Jeannie, whom I am very proud of and is now living in the
                    Washington area, married and with children, and doing very well.</p>
                <p>When I came to Washington, I really did get quite involved in events taking place
                    here. I learned that, even at a young age, you can become very involved and can
                    actually do a lot of work on issues of concern to you. If you work hard, spend
                    long hours and show a measure of ability, there are a lot of things you can do
                    in Washington. Working in the Senate at a young age is a fantastic experience.
                    Our high school junior daughter, Alison, is going to be working as an intern for
                    Senator Leahy. Our daughter in college, Ashley, she's a freshman at Bowdoin
                    College, is interested in government and Russia, where we lived for two years as
                    family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were with Senator Proxmire for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: A little over two years. Then I went into the ArmReserves, to fulfill
                    my military obligation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those two years, what were you doing? Were you
                        concentrated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: To a certain degree, one did all things, but I did have a focus on
                    defense and foreign policy. As a junior staff member, you did what you were
                    asked to do - drafting floor statements, drafting press releases, occasionally
                    getting involved in some legislative activities. It was a good entry level
                    position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a feel about politics in Wisconsin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Some, but I think the focus in Washington was on national politics.
                    The Vietnam War was continuing and Richard Nixon was president and Henry
                    Kissinger was the National Security Advisor. So this was a very interesting
                    time.</p>
                <p>Q: Within the staff, what was the impression that you developed and maybe your
                    colleagues did or maybe didn't toward the Nixon administration? You were there
                    when things came down.</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Proxmire had a number of battles that he fought with the Nixon
                    administration, including on whether to develop an SST, a supersonic transport.
                    He was opposed. He took on the military industrial complex. He was opposed to
                    the war in Vietnam. He worked very closely with Senator Gaylord Nelson of
                    Wisconsin and others on environmental issues, including Senator Edmund Muskie of
                    Maine. So there were plenty of fights with the administration on a number of
                    issues, but it was not cutthroat. It was respectful and almost always with a
                    constructive alternative attached to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What committees was Proxmire on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: He was on the Joint Economic Committee anBanking (he did a lot of
                    serious work on banking reform). The JEC is where he did his work on waste,
                    fraud, and abuse and the military. He was vice chairman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went into the Army Reserve for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Six months active duty, including basic training and advanced
                    individual training, and then a five and a half year commitment. A lot of my
                    friends and colleagues were trying to figure out what to do about the draft. A
                    number of us joined the Reserves. Many of us were strongly opposed to our
                    involvement in Vietnam, but we did not want to go to Canada and we were not
                    Conscientious Objectors. We wanted to find the right way to fulfill our military
                    obligation.</p>
                <p>Q: So, after you completed your full-time commitment to the Reserves in '71, you
                    came back. You had gone on as part of the congressional staff. Then you came
                    back to join a presidential campaign. How did that come about?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: One gets on the phone to see if one can find a position. Fortunately,
                    those Senate contacts that I mentioned earlier included people who put me in
                    touch with the two campaigns that I wanted to speak to. One was the Muskie
                    campaighe was the frontrunner on the Democratic side, and also the McGovern
                    campaign. I saw the Muskie people first and came away less than impressed
                    because they seemed to be taking the nomination for granted and were already
                    talking about how they would wage the campaign against Nixon. There wasn't any
                    sense of passion about the issues, including the war. It seemed more a “matter
                    of a fact” campaign than a campaign of some commitment. Then I went to see the
                    people in the McGovern campaign. John Holum had called one of the campaign
                    directors to see me. I went to the McGovern for President office, which was on
                    the House side of the Congress at First Street, SE. The person I wanted to see
                    actually had to leave to go see McGovern, so the receptionist asked if I would
                    see Gary Hart, his campaign manager. We sat down and in about 30 minutes Gary
                    sketched out how McGovern would win because he was going to take the primaries
                    and he was going to wage an aggressive campaign and he was going to end the war,
                    that this was a campaign about ideas and purpose. Here was the passion I was
                    looking for. Then he introduced me to Frank Mankiewitz, who was the co-campaign
                    manager with Hart and was Robert Kennedy's former press secretary. They asked if
                    I wanted to join the staff to do advance work. I immediately signed on and for
                    the next year and a half worked on that campaign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Advance work was just that. I would travel to places in advance of
                    Senator McGovern, set up the events, make sure the press was notified, worked
                    with the local coordinators. I did this in Florida, Illinois, and California.
                    Sometimes these were just routine political events. Sometimes, like in
                    California, they were a little different. McGovern went to see the Washington
                    Redskins play the Los Angeles Rams on Monday Night Football. He had a number of
                    backers from Hollywood so, as it turned out, we went to that game with Warren
                    Beatty and Julie Christie, two very well known movie actors. She had just
                    starred in 'Dr. Zhivago' as Lara. So these were not always your routine
                    political events that I was advancing!</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>More importantly, you did have a sense that this was a campaign with a mission.
                    McGovern was absolutely committed to seeing an end to American involvement in
                    Vietnam and spoke eloquently about it and rallied so many people to his cause.
                    Later in the campaign I did some political organizing. Once the primaries
                    started, I worked in New Hampshire and other states, and at the end of the
                    campaign, once McGovern had won the nomination and we had completed our work at
                    the Democratic Convention in Miami, we moved our headquarters to K. St. to a
                    larger building in Washington. I was asked to work there under Gary Hart and
                    Rick Stearns, who later became a federal judge in Massachusetts, and to be in
                    charge of the Southwest Region for McGovern. The region stretched from Texas to
                    California. We needed state coordinators, so Stearns invited one of his Rhodes
                    Scholar classmates at Oxford to take on the job of being the McGovern
                    co-coordinator for Texas. That was Bill Clinton. The other director was a
                    college classmate of mine at UNC, Taylor Branch, who later wrote this wonderful
                    biography of Martin Luther King, “Parting the Waters,” which won the Pulitzer
                    Prize. Bill Clinton came to the Washington headquarters before heading to Texas
                    and I met him for the first time. He was enormously personable. During the next
                    three months of the general campaign, he was one of the people I was most in
                    touch with because Texas had a ton of electoral votes. Unfortunately, McGovern
                    did not win Texas, nor did he win anywhere else except the District of Columbia
                    and Massachusetts!</p>
                <p>But a lot of us got to know each other then. A lot of people in that campaign
                    stayed involved in politics or government, including Bill Clinton himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel any part of the Nixon dirty tricks
                        campaign?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: There were reports about that. I did a montage of newspaper headlines
                    and photographs after the election. I still have it in my basement. It traced
                    the beginning of McGovern's campaign and his starting to win primaries and
                    building up momentum for the Democratic convention and then the general election
                    against Nixon. At the very end of that campaign, the Watergate reports in the
                    Washington Post were beginning to come out. ThITT scandal was also beginning to
                    surface. I had down at the bottom of this montage a small little clipping that
                    said of McGovern: “premature morality.” We all felt that we were against a
                    strong opponent and that there were probably some dirty tricks, but none of the
                    people I worked with had any sense of the extent of this, like the “plumbers”
                    operation. All that took a while to unfold, with thanks to Bob Woodward and Carl
                    Bernstein of the Post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with the Nixon campaigners?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were both two ships going on parallel places?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Their course was headed back for the White House with the Committee
                    to Reelect the President. Ours was basically to fight another day. But it was
                    very interesting. A lot of the people that were involved in that campaign
                    continued their commitment to and interest in public policy and issues. I think
                    there were two defining moments for many of us in my generation. There was the
                    assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963. We were old enough to have it impact
                    us - this young, idealistic president, the promise that he had, his role during
                    the Cuban Missile Crisis. That left a very strong impression, including on Bill
                    Clinton who has a famous photograph of himself as a teenager shaking hands with
                    President Kennedy in the Rose Garden when he was in Washington for Boys State. A
                    second defining moment was Vietnam and all the debate and protest that
                    surrounded it. That led many of us into the McGovern campaign and political
                    organizing and working on the national level, including people like Sandy
                    Berger, Tony Lake, John Podesta, John Holum, all of whom I later worked with in
                    the Clinton Administration.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any concern on your part about McGovern as far as being opposed to
                    the war but what would be the end game if he became President?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: He gave an acceptance speech in Miami at the Democratic Convention
                    which was a case study of how not to make your case to the American people. That
                    convention was chaotic. There was a lot of opposition to McGovern, even though
                    he had the delegates to get the nomination. There were a lot of floor fights.
                    It's not like conventions today, where things are scripted and run basically to
                    have the winning candidate appear on prime time television at 9:00 or 10:00 to
                    deliver an acceptance speech. McGovern's acceptance speech was given at 3:00 am.
                    Basically nobody watched that except the people at the convention itself. In
                    that speech, he kept referring to a theme that was used by his speechwriters,
                    which was “Come home, America.” The Nixon people took that and ran with it to
                    say that he was an isolationist. But McGovern meant “Come home, America” to
                    return to the nation's basic values and our involvement in Vietnam was contrary,
                    in his view, to those values and contrary to our interests. So “Come home,
                    America” was not to bring Americans back to a fortress America, but to reconnect
                    with those values which this country stood for and that were being put to the
                    test by the war in Vietnam. How he would have been able to do that I cannot say,
                    but I have no doubt that the war would not have continued for another three
                    years, with so many more lives lost. How it would have been done, one can only
                    speculate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of people who you'd meet in
                        varioulocalities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: A positive impression. People were committed. People that were
                    attempting to do something with their lives and trying to express themselves
                    through political action with a moral commitment. That doesn't mean that
                    everybody was a knight on a white horse. But what you did feel was a common
                    sense of purpose, of people concerned about the direction of the country and
                    willing spend their personal time to do something about it. And that's good.</p>
                <p>Q: After an election where your man loses, there must be people caught in a
                    cloudburst, running around, trying to look for something to do.</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Gary Hart said that, the day after the election, he came back to the
                    McGovern headquarters on K St. and had a meeting in his office. At one point he
                    leaned over to use the phone and he looked at it and said, “The line's dead.”
                    The phone company had already cut it off. He had to go out on the street and use
                    a pay phone. The day before he had been the campaign manager for the Democratic
                    nominee for President. Had that election gone well, he would have been moving to
                    the White House. It didn't and he was out in the street searching for the 25
                    cents to make a phone call.</p>
                <p>During the campaign, I had applied for a Fulbright scholarship and had been
                    accepted. I postponed it because McGovern won the nomination. Even though we
                    were committed, we weren't all convinced that he would win! So, in January, I
                    was off to Scotland on a one year Fulbright. So, even though the cloudburst had
                    occurred, there were always other places to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Scotland with your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Right. To Glasgow and the University of Strathclyde,which was one of
                    Britain's 'new universities.'</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What directed you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Number one, I had wanted to continue my graduate studies. Number two,
                    the Fulbright program is well known and has a great reputation. Not having
                    learned German as my father had urged me to, I was still without a foreign
                    language. When you apply, you apply to the countrin this case, the UK. I
                    envisioned I would find myself at Oxford or Cambridge if I was accepted.
                    Instead, I found myself in Glasgow, which turned out to be a great
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you study there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Again, political science, specifically comparative politics. I did a
                    lot of reading about the British system. I traveled to London for research. I
                    attended classes. It was a good year for me. This was my first trip out of the
                    country, except for a few excursions to Canada when I worked at a summer resort
                    in Vermont. But this was my first time to get on a plane and fly across the
                    Atlantic to London, and take a train to Glasgow. This was great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a difference in how one was taught between there
                        anNorth Carolina?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Certainly the accent was different! The British accent is so
                    intimidating. I never had a full southern accent. I think my father's
                    Connecticut Yankee background influenced my North Carolina roots. The British,
                    of course, speak the language so perfectly that you are a little bit intimidated
                    by the precision with which they address you.</p>
                <p>Q: At the end of this, was there a game plan?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Continue my studies. While in Glasgow, I applied to Princeton and
                    went there after we returned to the U.S. for the purpose of getting my Ph.D. I
                    was accepted in the Department of Politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your Ph.D. was in political science. I assume that
                        eacindividual had a breakdown of what they wanted to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: You mean within the discipline itself?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: No, not necessarily. I was still taking a number of courses in
                    American government. In fact, when I was at Princeton, I was a preceptor, their
                    term for a graduate instructor. I worked with Professor Fred I. Greenstein, who
                    is one of the country's leading experts on the American presidency. He would
                    give the lecture and then break his class down into smaller seminars with
                    graduate instructors.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I also found myself spending a great deal of time at the Woodrow Wilson School,
                    which is directly adjacent to the Department of Politics at Princeton. Again, I
                    took courses in international affairs, including under Dr. Richard Ullman, and
                    public policy analysis. My plan was to get my Master's, and then start writing
                    the dissertation for my Ph.D. However, politics in Washington intervened again.
                    Gary Hart had gone back to his home state of Colorado and run for the Senate and
                    won. I called to congratulate him and he asked me what I was doing. I said I was
                    at Princeton. He said, “Why don't you come down to Washington and let's talk
                    about things?” So, I came down to meet him. The conversation led to my decision
                    to leave Princeton with my Master's in hand, but no Ph.D., and return to
                    Washington to work on the Senate staff.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find Gary Hart? I talked to somebody who was a Foreign Service
                    officer who worked with Gary Hart on one of these six months here, six months
                    there. He said that he was really looking forward to it and when he got there,
                    he hardly saw him at all and he seemed to be pretty aloof. How did you find
                    him?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Again, I had worked with him on the McGovern campaign, so I had
                    gotten to know him very well, and liked him. As I mentioned earlier, he hired me
                    for the campaign and had made a very strong and convincing presentation about
                    not only why George McGovern had a chance to win the presidency, but that there
                    was a purpose to be served, and why it was so important for the country.</p>
                <p>I think in many ways - philosophically, politically, and in one personal waGary
                    Hart laid the groundwork for Bill Clinton. Hart saw himself as a new Democrat.
                    At one point during his campaign for the Senate, Gary was interviewed by either
                    the Post of the Times and the reporter said, “But you're a liberal Democrat.”
                    Hart said, “Yes, but we're not a bunch of little Hubert Humphreys.” That was not
                    meant to be disrespectful to Hubert Humphrey, who was an beloved figure of the
                    Party, but that the New Deal and the Fair Deal days were over and that Democrats
                    had to find a new way to express themselves in terms of being activists in favor
                    of government but not trying to throw government programs at every problem. That
                    same theme found its voice in Bill Clinton's presidential campaign many years
                    later. Clinton called it his “Third Way.” Gary Hart established the foundation
                    for Democrats redefining themselves in a way that would be not seen as big
                    spenders and big government. I think that he did an important service for his
                    Party.</p>
                <p>Also, Gary Hart is a very intelligent man. He was a founder of the Military
                    Reform Caucus when he served in the Senate, along with Republican Bill Cohen of
                    Maine who would later become Defense Secretary under Bill Clinton. That, too,
                    was a new way of looking at military issues, where Democrats would not be seen
                    as against military programs, but advocating ways to reform the armed forces and
                    work with the defense establishment to do so.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Unfortunately, Gary Hart also had his own personal problems that led to his
                    withdrawal from the presidential race in 1988, over reports about his sexual
                    relationships. Hart went through the media mill. A “feeding frenzy” they called
                    it. Of course he had his own responsibility in this. He basically challenged the
                    press, saying, “If you think I'm doing something, why don't you follow me?” They
                    did. It was too bad. It appeared self- destructive. I found Gary Hart to be very
                    personable and extraordinarily able, politically smart, but unfortunately he had
                    something about his own personality which led to the premature end to his
                    presidential aspirations. Many years later when Bill Clinton was confronted in
                    the New Hampshire primary with charges of extramarital affairs, I believe he was
                    able to navigate through that because of the sheer force of his own personality,
                    never giving up, but also because Gary Hart had taken the first media blow on
                    reports of this kind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Things happened to these people, so it wasn't quite the
                        shock.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Exactly.</p>
                <p>Q: Obviously this isn't the focus of our interview, but I think it's interesting
                    to examine the sociology of this. In your observation, is there something about
                    some candidates that... It's not so much attracting women, but how they deal
                    with it. It's the damnedest thing.</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: This really isn't part of the interview and one that I don't really
                    want to speak to. These are things about the personal lives of public people. I
                    think that as long as a politician's personal life does not impinge on his or
                    her public responsibilities, their personal lives should remain private.</p>
                <p>Q: Fair enough. One of our problems in our country is that these things can often
                    have a life of their own. We're not that loyalistic a country in many ways
                    except when it gets into public. Then it becomes a political matter.What were
                    you doing with Hart?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Initially, I graduated from being a Staff Assistant to Senator
                    Proxmire to being a Legislative Assistant for Senator Hart. But almost
                    immediately upon taking that position, he was appointed to the Church
                    Intelligence Committee. That committee was established in response to
                    allegations that our intelligence agencies were involved in illegal or improper
                    activities. There were reports that the CIA had been involved in assassination
                    plots against foreign leaders, trying to overthrow a democratically elected
                    government in Chile, of FBI files on innocent American citizens, and military
                    intelligence spying on protestors. This was in '75. The Senate and the House
                    established committees to investigate these charges and allegations.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Gary Hart was appointed to that committee. It was a major assignment. The
                    committee included some of the giants of the Senate at that time, like Frank
                    Church, Barry Goldwater, Howard Baker, Philip Hart from Michigan, John Tower of
                    Texas, Walter Mondale of Minnesota. It was a high powered, extraordinary
                    committee. Hart was one of the few freshmen Senators on the committee. He asked
                    me if I would like to join the committee staff and be his representative. I
                    said, “Absolutely.” This was going to be a fascinating encounter, the first ever
                    committee established by the Senate to look into the workings of our
                    intelligence community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have been involved with Frank Church.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: No, I had not had any contact with him, but I had watched his Senate
                    career closely when I worked in the Senate for Proxmire and knew some of his
                    staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do as a staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: They organized the investigating committee into four task forces. One
                    was called Command and Control, which was really a White House oriented task
                    force. One was on foreign intelligence, which was CIA. One was on domestic
                    intelligence, which was mainly the FBI. One was on military intelligence, which
                    was NSA and DIA. I was assigned to the Command and Control task force and worked
                    with Senator Mondale's principal assistant, David Aaron, and one of Senator
                    Church's key aides, Loch Johnson. Loch is now a professor of political science
                    at Georgia and is one of our nation's leading experts on the intelligence
                    community. He is also a very good friend.</p>
                <p>In addition to the task forces, a smaller group was set up to look into the
                    illegal assassination plots against foreign leaders. Hart was asked to join anI
                    took part as well. We did a report on plots against Castro, Lumumba of the
                    Congo, General Rene Schneider in Chile, Diem of South Vietnam. Of course, this
                    was getting a great deal of public attention, including in th“New York Times,”
                    “Washington Post,” and the evening news on television.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>The Committee spent several months delving into the workings of the CIA. I spent
                    many hours out at the Agency going through files, reports that they had done by
                    their Inspector Generals. In many ways I actually gained an appreciation for the
                    professionalism of these agencies. As we found out, the CIA had done its own
                    internal review of these allegations, which was then turned over to President
                    Ford and an executive commission he had established, the Rockefeller Commission.
                    These files were turned over to the Senate Intelligence Committee. Eventually
                    all of this work, all of this intensive inquiry, resulted in what I consider the
                    most important outcome, namely the establishment of Senate and House permanent
                    intelligence committees. It was clear that the Congress had not exercised
                    adequate oversight of intelligence activities in the past and that needed to
                    change. Those committees are still operating today. They have brought a great
                    deal of accountability to the work of intelligence and indeed support. There is
                    no question that this country needs a strong intelligence community, but it also
                    needs it to be run lawfully and respecting civil liberties. I thinCongress has
                    played an important role, as well as the agencies themselves, in establishing
                    watchdogs to ensure that those kinds of activities that we saw during the Church
                    Committee investigation do not occur again.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of the press coverage of this? This was hot news?
                    There is a tendency not to put things into the context and to put it into the
                    most garish light possible.</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Often on Capitol Hill, those who work on the Senate side feel
                    slightly superior to those on the House side. It's not only Members but staff.
                    So, I don't want what I am about to say to be seen in that light. But I felt
                    that the Church Committee handled itself much more responsibly than the House
                    Committee, which was led by Congressman Pike. They had a lot of leaks, a lot of
                    battles on declassifying material. When those battles took place, a lot of the
                    material they were debating internally made its way the press. We felt very
                    strongly on the Church Committee that it was terribly important to make certain
                    that only that information that was authorized by the committee would be
                    released, that leaking a story would undermine the credibility of the committee
                    and call into question the ability of Congress to handled sensitive, highly
                    classified material. By and large, that was the way the committee operated.</p>
                <p>Now, the press wanted to see James Bond around every corner. Sometimes, the
                    committee and its chairman would play to that. William Colby, who was then the
                    CIA director, was asked to come to the first public hearing with a poison dart
                    gun, which some scientist at the CIA had developed. Of course, the thing had
                    never been used, but it looked pretty good for the cameras. But on the whole,
                    the committee hearings were serious and thorough. I worked on the report on the
                    CIA's covert action program in Chile and, along with three other staff members,
                    testified before the committee in open session on our findings. The Ford
                    Administration had refused to send any official to take part in the hearing. In
                    recent years even more information about the extent of U.S. involvement in the
                    coup against Allende has come to light but, basically, I think we got the story
                    right at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your basic committee reading on Chile?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: At one point, Church said the CIA was a “rogue elephant” out of
                    control. I respectfully disagree with that assessment. I think if there was a
                    “rogue elephant,” it was operating in this case out of the Oval Office. On
                    Chile, the Agency conducted a number of activities to undermine support for
                    Salvador Allende, who was a socialist but had been elected in a free,
                    constitutional vote. But those activities were undertaken not independently by
                    the CIA but at the direction of President Nixon and the National Security
                    Council committee overseeing the CIA and covert activities, which included
                    Secretary of State Kissinger. Richard Helms, the CIA director, said that he went
                    into the Oval Office and President Nixon was adamant that something had to be
                    done abouAllende. Helms said, “If I ever left the Oval Office with a field
                    marshall's baton in my hand, it was that day.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get into the missing problem? I'm talking about
                        thbook, “The Missing.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Sure. That as well as the assassination of Orlando Letelier, the
                    former Chilean foreign minister. I had interviewed Letelier just days before he
                    was killed by that car bomb here in Washington. We did get into these things.
                    Charles Harmon was the missing person that you're referring to, the American
                    citizen...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a movie made.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: The movie, I thought, was somewhat unfair in the way it portrayed the
                    American ambassador, Nathaniel Davis. But there is no question, as we have
                    subsequently learned, that there was more information about Harmon that should
                    have been pursued at the time.</p>
                <p>I think that, for me, the committee investigation reinforced the view that all
                    parts of out government must be accountable and that, no matter how difficult,
                    the oversight function must be performed. That is the only way to do it. Members
                    of the Congress must have access to information to be able to perform that
                    oversight function. Some alleged later that the investigations themselves had
                    set back our intelligence collection capabilities around the world. I do not
                    think that that was accurate. It may have had some minimal impact, but the
                    strength that was gained by insuring that these activities are authorized and
                    understood and compatible with our values far outweighed whatever temporary loss
                    had occurred. This makes us the country we are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I agree. I must say that covert actions in the long run
                        aressentially counterproductive.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I think they can be. We had to address the issue of whether or not
                    there should be a ban on covert action. The committee did not support that, nor
                    did I. There are times when a covert operation designed to disguise the official
                    hand of the U.S. could be helpful. At the same time, we did see during the
                    Committee's investigation an Executive Order issued by President Ford, and
                    endorsed by the committee, declaring a flat prohibition on the assassination of
                    foreign leaders, undertaken by U.S. officials directly or indirectly. That
                    Executive Order is still in effect today. President Ford was right to issue it
                    and every president has maintained it. Now, that is a covert action which is
                    very dangerous and totally counterproductive. When you start engaging in
                    official assassination, then all leaders become fair game.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I agree. You were with the Church Committee and then what
                        diyou do? Was Hart running for President?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: No. This was 1976. The new committee established by the investigating
                    committee was led by Senator Inouye. That was set up in '76 after the Church
                    Committee completed its work. Gary Hart became a member of the permanent
                    Committee. I stayed on. Then something very interesting happened in terms of the
                    next presidential election, 1976. Each of these election'68, '72, and '76 - and
                    the following election in '80 - had something to say about my own personal and
                    professional life.</p>
                <p>I was working on the White House Command and Control Task Force with David Aaron,
                    who was Senator Mondale's representative. Mondale was chosen by Jimmy Carter to
                    be his running mate. It was a close election between Jimmy Carter and Gerald
                    Ford, which Carter won. Gary Hart and I had gone on an oversight trip to about
                    five countries in November. It was the first oversight trip by a member of the
                    new Senate Intelligence Committee. We went to Israel and Greece, which has had
                    an interesting relationship to intelligence over the years, Italy, Iran (the
                    Shah was still in power). We were in Iran staying at the home of Ambassador
                    Richard Helms, the former CIA director, when a call came for me from David Aaron
                    asking whether, when I returned to Washington, I would join the Carter-Mondale
                    transition team and work with him. He had been assigned by soon-to-be Vice
                    President Mondale to do the transition work for the NSC and the CIA. I went down
                    and talked to Gary. He said, “I'd hate to see you go. If you go on a transition
                    team, I'm sure you're going to be asked to join the administration, but I can't
                    stand in your way on that. Do it.” When I got back, I went to work on the
                    transition team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What part of the transition team did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Again, it was for the NSC and the CIA. A transition team prepares
                    briefing books for the people that are appointed to those positions. So, in this
                    case, we went to the Old Executive Office Building next to the White House. We
                    were given offices. We first spoke with General Brent Scowcroft, who was Ford's
                    National Security Advisor. We also went out to the CIA and met with the CIA
                    Director, George Bush, and started pulling together information about
                    organizational structure, personnel, current directives, issues of interest,
                    problem areas, etc. It's a major undertaking and you have a limited amount of
                    time to do it.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, Zbigniew Brzezinski became President Carter's National Security
                    Advisor and so David and I, when Brzezinski was appointed, started working with
                    him. We also worked at a slightly more distant fashion with the nominee to be
                    the CIA director, President Kennedy's former counsel, Ted Sorensen.
                    Unfortunately, he did not make it through the nomination process.</p>
                <p>David and I worked very closely with Brzezinski. I had never met him before. I
                    knew of him, of course, because he was a very well known academic and foreign
                    policy adviser. After three weeks of working together, Brzezinski asked David to
                    stay on to be the Deputy National Security Advisor and asked me to stay on to be
                    his Special Assistant and work at the White House with him.</p>
                <p>Q: You had Brent Scowcroft, who was a professional military officer who later
                    kept coming back with George Bush. He was National Security Advisor. Having gone
                    through almost the trauma of the Kissinger National Security Advisor, were
                    Scowcroft or others saying, “Maybe you ought to tone this thing down?”</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Actually, Scowcroft had already toned it down. Later, I wrote a book
                    on the National Security Council with Loch Johnson entitled “Decisions of the
                    Highest Order: Perspectives on the National Security Council.” Scowcroft became
                    for those of us who have studied the National Security Council the model of a
                    National Security Advisor low key, a coordinator (not a policy maker). By that
                    time, Kissinger had become Secretary of State, which was a whole new dimension
                    to the Kissinger persona, but I think that it was agreed that the National
                    Security Council under Kissinger had become too dominant and had caused problems
                    in the policy making process by moving State out of the center and, to a certain
                    degree, the Defense Department as well. Scowcroft came in and became what is
                    called an “honest broker” at the NSC. He was the person who saw the President
                    most often, but he was always seen as one who accurately and fairly presented
                    the views of departments and agencies. If asked his views, I'm sure he provided
                    those to the President, but he ran the NSC as an “honest broker.” He stayed out
                    of the limelight. He didn't appear on television. He wasn't competing to be
                    chief foreign policy spokesman. The Scowcroft model has continued to be the one
                    that most people look to as the best example of how the NSC system should run.
                    Of course, along came a new National Security Advisor in Zbigniew Brzezinski. As
                    we know, during his four years, there was an enormous struggle at times between
                    Brzezinski and the Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance. They had some fundamental
                    differences, which have been spelled out in books and articles since then, on
                    issues of great importance, including our approach to the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Clearly I was delighted at the age of 29 to be asked to work in the West Wing of
                    the White House, jut around the corner from the Oval Office. This was a
                    fantastic experience. At that point, I was seeing my soon-to-be wife, Merrie
                    Roosa. We went to the Inauguration together, which was conducted at the West
                    Front of the Capitol. We sat there and watched President Carter be sworn in.
                    Then I went to the White House and started working on January 20th.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find empty file cabinets?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Yes. Things were empty in the sense that people hadn't left things on
                    their desks. But it was a very smooth transition. General Scowcroft is a class
                    act and a great gentleman. My counterpart for the transition was his special
                    assistant, Robert (Bud) McFarland, who later became National Security Advisor to
                    President Reagan. The transition went very well. Brzezinski put togther quite a
                    stellar National Security Council staff. I was Brzezinski's special assistant.
                    The staff assistant was Robert Gates, who later became CIA Director under the
                    first President Bush. The military assistant was Colonel Bill Odom, who later
                    was promoted to General and became head of the National Security Agency under
                    President Reagan. After about six or eight months, Brzezinski brought in a
                    legislative director for congressional relations, Madeleine Albright, who we all
                    know later became Secretary of State. You can go down the list of people. David
                    Aaron would later be our Ambassador to the OSCE in Paris and Under Secretary of
                    Commerce under President Clinton. We had people like William Hyland and Reg
                    Bartholomew and Mike Oksenberg, Mike Armacost, who later became Ambassador to
                    Japan and an Under Secretary of State. Jessica Matthews, who is now President of
                    the Carnegie Endowment, was in charge of the Global Affairs Office. Zbig really
                    did pull together an excellent team of academics and professionals and people
                    that were detailed from other departments like State to the National Security
                    Council. Brzezinski himself was extraordinarily fascinating to work with and
                    learn from. He was very loyal to his staff. He worked very hard. He was probably
                    one of the smartest people that I've ever known. And at the age of 29, despite
                    the vast discrepancy in his background experiences and mine, he always gave me
                    the sense that he truly wanted to know my views. This was a great experience. We
                    also played tennis together on the White House court, which was a heady thing to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Was it true that Jimmy Carter...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Yes, he did. The President on occasion went down to the tennis court
                    and discovered that somebody was already there, so he told his secretary, Susan
                    Clough, “I want to see who's going to be on the court and when.” It wasn't as if
                    that was his highest priority, but indeed, he did want to know if the court was
                    being used. So Zbig was very careful! Not only was he extraordinarily smart and
                    an academic of great acclaim, he was a very savvy bureaucrat.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get the feeling that early on... There was some talk that Brzezinski
                    was trying to outkissinger Kissinger, emulate Kissinger, or keep the power at
                    the NSC. Rather than low key, it was going to be high key.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Brzezinski is not only bright, he is also very aggressive, including
                    in a policy-making sense. There was no question that the National Security
                    Council staff he put together were intended to be a high-powered NSC. You do not
                    bring in people like Bill Quandt on the Mideast and Oksenberg and Armacost on
                    Asia and experienced policy hands like Hyland, Bartholomew and Aaron without
                    recognizing that you have got a bunch thoroughbreds and they're going to want to
                    run. I have no doubt at all that in his discussions with President Carter,
                    Brzezinski was very up-front, “I want to bring in the best possible National
                    Security Council staff to serve you.” The NSC staff is meant to be the
                    President's in-house foreign policy team to represent his interests, not any
                    particular departmental point of view, and to protect the President's interests.
                    State will have a point of view. Defense will have a point of view. Treasury
                    will on economic issues. You've got all these players. Coordination has to come
                    from somewhere.</p>
                <p>Coordination was the purpose of the 1947 National Security Council Act which
                    established the NSC. Increasingly since McGeorge Bundy under President Kennedy,
                    the National Security Advisor brings things together to make sure the President
                    has all the information he needs and that options are available and that
                    unpleasant facts are not covered up, etc. Clearly Dr. Brzezinski was well aware
                    of the forceful role that Dr. Kissinger had played as National Security Advisor.
                    They had known each other for many years academically and often were mentioned
                    as being the leading candidates for high government positions coming out of
                    academia.</p>
                <p>So I think that Brzezinski wanted to be an activist, he wanted to have the very
                    best possible NSC staff. But, at the end of the day, the one truism about the
                    National Security Council is that it is a reflection of the President's desires
                    and style and needs, not a creature of the National Security Advisor. If
                    President Carter had not wanted an activist policy-oriented National Security
                    Advisor, then he would not have chosen Brzezinski. I also believe that
                    Brzezinski was very attentive to the need to perform the “honest broker” role,
                    although not in a low key fashion as Scowcroft did. All the papers flowing from
                    the NSC staff to Brzezinski came first to David Aaron and then to me for making
                    sure that all views were there and that things were organized. Even though a lot
                    of these subjects were not ones that I was nearly as knowledgeable about as the
                    experts on the NSC staff, I would read through and point out what I thought were
                    deficiencies and sometimes send things back to the staff. Then the papers would
                    go to Brzezinski. On top of these papers, there would be a cover memo from him
                    to the President saying, “Mr. President, these are the issues. This is, in
                    summary, what is being recommended by your advisers. At tab A is Secretary
                    Vance's view; at tab B is Secretary Brown's view.” He did perform that role of
                    ensuring that all options and views were expressed. He also had his own views
                    and he was never reluctant to express them. But he did perform the “honest
                    broker”role of insuring that the President had the information he needed from
                    all his advisers.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The National Security Advisor also briefs the President in the morning. Proximity
                    is enormously important in government and the National Security Advisor is the
                    most proximate security official to the President. Phones are great things, but
                    seeing somebody in your office at 7:00 or 7:30 every morning, there are
                    advantages to that. Right now in the new administration, Condoleeza Rice has
                    that role. She will see more of President Bush than Colin Powell or Donald
                    Rumsfeld, but the key thing is to make sure that their views are given a full
                    airing before the President.</p>
                <p>With the NSC under President Carter, there did develop over time sharp
                    differences of view about how to pursue our policy toward the Soviet Union, and
                    the role of arms control, and China. Brzezinski was very involved in normalizing
                    relations with China. In fact, he went there on a special mission in May 1978 to
                    establish a path toward full diplomatic relations with Chinese officials. Of
                    course, Secretary Vance was well aware of that and the President directed it.
                    Even so, there were disagreements between Vance and Brzezinski about timing and
                    substance. But there is a truism here. If a president sees strong differences
                    arising that threaten the success and coherence of his foreign policy, then it
                    is up to him to act to resolve them. Many presidents want competing views. FDR
                    wanted that. But you've got to be able to manage them. I think it is clear that
                    President Carter, despite the best of intentions, was not able to manage the
                    differences within his own administration on a number of key issues. He also had
                    some very bad luck, including the Iranian hostage crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which had nothing to do with him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Which had nothing to do with him, but the way he handled it, I'm
                    afraid, had everything to do with him. There were perhaps 40 hostages. Jimmy
                    Carter became the 41st hostage. His handling of the hostage situation and the
                    crisis itself was probably the fatal undermining of his presidency and led to
                    Ronald Reagan becoming the next President of the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there four years?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: No, I was there for two and a half years. Then I was asked by a
                    former colleague on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Bill Bader, to join him
                    as the Deputy Staff Director, the number two job, at the Foreign Relations
                    Committee. Frank Church had recently become chairman of the committee. Bill
                    Bader was asked by Church to be chief of staff. It was a great offer. It was
                    hard to leave the White House, but as a special assistant there's only so much
                    you can do. You are working directly with the National Security Advisor, but
                    while you are involved in everything, you are in charge of nothing. You're not
                    the expert on Western Europe or arms control. So this was an opportunity. The
                    SALT II treaty was making its way to the Senate. Bill Bader asked me to come
                    help oversee the Committee's examination of that very important arms control
                    agreement. I made the decision to go. It was hard. I did not want to leave Dr.
                    Brzezinski. Fortunately, the staff assistant I mentioned earlier, Bob Gates,
                    took over my job, so Zbig was well served.</p>
                <p>Before I departed, Dr. Brzezinski took me to the Oval Office, quite unexpectedly,
                    on my last day for a farewell meeting with President Carter. Unfortunately, I
                    had not gotten a haircut recently. I look at the photographs of that meeting
                    today and say, “Wait a minute.” It wasn't that long, by the standards then, but
                    it was certainly longer than it is today. But I really appreciated Zbig's
                    thoughtfulness, and the President's.</p>
                <p>I also remember coming back from playing tennis one day with Brzezinski. We were
                    walking up the driveway that leads past the Oval Office and to the West Wing. He
                    looked at me and said, “You know, you only get one chance in life to do this. It
                    is the greatest thing to be able to work at the White House with the President.
                    This only comes around once.” I thought, “Well, maybe it's once for you, but I
                    hope it's not just once for me!” He was well into his career, with an
                    established reputation, but I was still relatively young and I hoped that there
                    would be another opportunity to serve. Fortunately, there was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for a year and a half?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: A year and a half on the Foreign Relations Committee. The SALT treaty
                    was the dominant piece of business. But when I first got there, it was the
                    Taiwan Relations Act, which is interesting because right now because we're in
                    another standoff with China over the U.S. spy plane they forced down, making
                    this the first foreign policy crisis of the George W. Bush administration. The
                    Taiwan Relations Act was passed at the time that I joined the Committee in '79.
                    In '80, I went to Taiwan with two other staff members to do a report for the
                    Committee on Taiwan one year after the Taiwan Relations Act went into
                    effect.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>But the big issue facing the Committee when I was there was the SALT II treaty.
                    It was going to be a difficult sell because of hardline opposition from Senator
                    Scoop Jackson of Washington and others. The Administration was committed but
                    there were a lot of difficult issues. This was still very much during the Cold
                    War and, and a little over a year later, when the Soviets went into Afghanistan,
                    that was the end of the SALT treaty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was December of '79.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Yes. The Committee's consideration of SALT II stopped and it was
                    over. The Iranian hostage crisis was also taking place at that time. Then the
                    '80 election got going in full swing and Ronald Reagan was nominated. When I was
                    working in the Senate, I got a call from David Aaron at the White House asking
                    if I could assist in preparing President Carter's briefing book for the
                    televised debates against Governor Reagan. Because of certain Executive Branch
                    restrictions, specifically the Hatch Act, the NSC staff could not engage in any
                    political activities. I was in the Senate, so I could, if it was after hours.
                    So, for about three weeks, along with a couple of colleagues in the Senate, we
                    went over to the Old Executive Office Building to pull together briefing papers
                    on all the foreign policy issues likely to come up in the debate. We finished
                    the job and turned the briefing book over to David Aaron. I got a nice note from
                    Dr. Brzezinski saying how much he appreciated it. The material then went to the
                    President, although I'm sure with some changes. Then I watched the Carter-Reagan
                    debates very carefully with the team I had organized to help. Even though
                    President Carter was on top of the issues, Governor Reagan's personality
                    captivated and dominated. He was clearly much more at ease than President
                    Carter. At one point, the President was asked what was the major issue he was
                    concerned about? He said that he had recently asked his daughter, Amy, and she
                    said, “Nuclear proliferation.” We looked at ourselves and said, “That wasn't in
                    our briefing book.”</p>
                <p>On election night, Madeleine Albright asked us to her home in Georgetown to watch
                    the returns. Merrie and I got there around 7:30. I had a clipboard with all the
                    states and the electoral count and I was ready for a long evening. Zbig
                    Brzezinski was already there and he looked at me and asked, “What's the
                    clipboard for?” I said, “When the election returns start coming in...” He said,
                    “We've lost.” I said, “Zbig, it's 7:30.” Some of the first returns had come in,
                    but clearly Zbig was aware of the polling the White House had done and that this
                    election was over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the President was told the day before. They
                        said,“You've lost.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Yes. He was told by his pollster, Pat Caddell, that the numbers were
                    running against him and there was no turning it around. So, this National
                    Security Council and White House group went from Albright's Georgetown home to
                    the downtown hotel where Carter conceded. Unfortunately he did this too early in
                    the evening and that had an impact on several races out West, including some
                    that I'll speak about in a moment. But, of course, I was then working in the
                    Senate. The Senate was not expected to be lost to the Republicans. Merrie and I
                    then went to a Senate gathering. That took much longer, but around 1:30 am, the
                    results started coming in, including Frank Church being defeated. Then the
                    reports came in that the Senate was going to go to the Republicans. I quickly
                    realized that this had certain profound implications for what I was doing
                    because I was working on the Democratic staff of the Foreign Relations Committee
                    for the Democratic chairman and that was going to change.</p>
                <p>The changeover in the White House and the Senatfrom Democratic to Republican
                    control - would clearly have major implications for the direction of the country
                    and U.S. foreign policy. But it also that meant something for me on a more
                    personal level. It was time - as you euphemistically say in Washingtoto start
                    looking for “other opportunities.” In other words, another job.</p>
                <p>***</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is May 11, 2001. You left the Senate staff and went
                        to ABNews. That was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: It was early in '81. I think there was about a four to five month
                    period after the 1980 election before I joined ABC. This was truly 'out of the
                    blue.' I had been thinking of what I wanted to do next, and at one point while I
                    was on the Foreign Relations Committee I had been interviewed by “60 Minutes”
                    for a report that they were doing. Unfortunately, my contribution was left on
                    the cutting room floor, but I got to know the producer for CBS. When I left, I
                    thought one thing that would be of interest would be documentary making.
                    Unfortunately, documentaries for networks were already becoming a thing of the
                    past, but I did make some contacts and saw people at CBS, NBC, and ABC. The
                    person at ABC, the deputy bureau chief, Bob Zelnick, said, “We don't really have
                    anything there, but would you like to be a correspondent?” I said, “You must
                    have the wrong person. I'm not a journalist. I've never done television.” He
                    said, “Well, we're looking for people with substantive experience. You've had a
                    lot of experience in government. You've been focusing on arms control and
                    national security. We now have lawyers that cover the justice beat. We have
                    medical doctors that do medical reports like Dr. Tim Johnson at ABC. You look
                    presentable. Why don't you do an audition?” I said, “Well, let me get back to
                    you.” I really didn't take it that seriously. I went off and started looking at
                    other things, including some opportunities in New York. I saw Bob Zelnick again
                    about two months later. He said, “Why haven't you come to do the audition?” I
                    said, “Okay, I'll do it.” He said, “Write up a script. We will put it on a
                    teleprompter. We'll send the tape to New York and see what headquarters thinks
                    of it.” It went up on a Friday. On Monday, I got a phone call.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any particular thing to report on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Well, Zelnick had said, “Whatever is of interest to you.” At that
                    point, there was a lot of discussion about the Reagan defense budget, how large
                    it would be. Reagan was coming in to build up America's military. So, I did
                    that. On Monday, I got an urgent call from Zelnick's office saying, “Please send
                    us another copy of your resume. New York is interested, but Bob has lost it.”
                    The next day, I got a call from Zelnick saying that they were sending down an
                    ABC News vice president to talk to me. George Watson was his name. Apparently,
                    the tape had gone up to New York where they were screening it and Roone Arledge,
                    the legendary head of ABC, walked by. He said, “He looks interesting. Why don't
                    we try to get him?” Within a week, I had signed a three year contract to be a
                    correspondent at ABC and to focus on national security-State Department-Defense
                    Department affairs and arms control. Of course, this was what I was already most
                    focused on at that point, having come from the Senate and the debate there on
                    the SALT II treaty. So, there I was at ABC, brand new.</p>
                <p>Q: The view the media has on issues has a profound effect on how American policy
                    works? Tell me about your experiences and some of the issues you were dealing
                    with and how the system used those.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Those are good questions. The media and how it covers important
                    issues does have a major impact on society today. I actually took that
                    responsibility very seriously. Most of the time a report on the evening or
                    morning news would last 90 seconds. If you had over a two minute piece, that was
                    long. So those reports were brief and you're dealing with complicated issuearms
                    control was certainly complicated. But how these issues are presented is also
                    very important in other words, what is new about the story, is it balanced, are
                    you providing enough solid information to the public so that they can have an
                    informed opinion.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, in some ways I felt all this was quite consistent with my previous
                    involvement in government. Yes, I was now in the private sector because ABC News
                    is a private company, but I was still involved in public issues. Sometimes
                    people would ask me, “How could you go to the media after being in government?”
                    I said, “Well, I'm dealing with the same issues, only from a different vantage
                    point. I'm still going to the State Department, to the Defense Department, to
                    Capitol Hill.”</p>
                <p>Now in '80/'81, the three networkABC, CBS, and NBwere still dominating the news.
                    CNN was in its earliest days. Cable was just starting. So most people were
                    getting their broadcast news from the networks. That has dropped significantly
                    today because of CNN, of FOX, because cable in general. But at that time, the
                    evening news was the place to watcas I had with Walter Cronkite during the
                    Vietnam War - you went to the networks to hear the news at the 6:30/7:00
                    hour.</p>
                <p>At times I found my new profession a rather humbling experience. I knew the
                    subjects, but I had to learn television. I had to learn how to appear before the
                    camera, how not be too stiff. I often felt sympathy for Al Gore during his past
                    campaign, during the times when he was considered to be a little bit too
                    “wooden.” But what I did certainly enjoy was the opportunity to report the news,
                    speak with interesting 'newsmakers,' and report from lots of different
                    locations. By 1985, I was focusing more and more on arms control. President
                    Reagan had started negotiations with the Soviets. Mikhail Gorbachev was soon to
                    come to power in the Soviet Union. Summits, including the first one between
                    Reagan and Gorbachev in Geneva, were taking place. I covered some of these. The
                    on-going strategic nuclear arms talks in Geneva had me spending about two months
                    out of every year there. I would go for about a week at a time. When the next
                    round began or ended, I would go back to do updates.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>It was also during this time, much to my surprise, that I had an opportunity to
                    take part in a ten part series on ABC's 'World News Tonight” with Peter Jennings
                    entitled “The USSR: A Balance of Powers,” looking at all the dimensions of the
                    relationship. I was given the arms control report to do. We had six minutes
                    pieces on the evening news, which was basically unheard of. That series won an
                    Emmy and I received a call saying, “Rick, you've won an Emmy.” Along with my
                    wife Merrie and my parents, I couldn't believe it. I was very fortunate to be
                    covering what was a very important period for arms control and U.S.-Soviet
                    relations. To watch the way that President Reagan came into office as a staunch
                    anti-communist and later respond in such a positive fashion to Mikhail Gorbachev
                    as a new Soviet leader was fascinating- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>All of this led to my increasing interest in being assigned to Moscow. My wife's
                    parents had focused on the Soviet Union for a number of years. Her mother, Ruth
                    Roosa, was a professor of Russian history, had done a lot of research in the
                    Soviet archives in Leningrad. Her father, Robert Roosa, had served as
                    Undersecretary of the Treasury in the Kennedy administration and later, when he
                    was with Brown Brothers &amp; Harriman on Wall Street and Chairman of the
                    Brookings Institution, he was on the U.S.-Soviet Trade and Economic Council.
                    They had traveled to Russia on several occasions, including as a family with
                    Merrie and her sister Sunny, and had many contacts. Then came the opportunity in
                    1989 for me to be assigned there with Merrie and Ashley and Alison, who were
                    then seven and five years old. It proved to be a fascinating experience. I wish
                    that I could say that I was prescient enough to say that I had a hunch that I
                    was going there to witness the demise of the Soviet empire, but I can't. But I
                    did know that Gorbachev would prove a remarkable new Soviet leader as he tried
                    to put into effect glasnost, or openness, and perestroika, restructuring. To
                    have a ringside seat for that was a once in a lifetime opportunity.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's go back a bit. While you were reporting on military matters, how did you
                    find the news operation, the guys who sit in the glassed in cages behind you...
                    When they'd say, “Go after this,” did you feel there was a strong hand directing
                    or was this off to one side so unless you got too far away, they let you
                    alone?</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: In the TV news business, producers are the equivalent of editors in
                    print journalism. You have executive producers of various broadcasts and senior
                    producers. They're the ones you speak to about assignments. Certain things are
                    simply required. Congressional hearings, such as when the Secretary of State or
                    the Secretary of Defense appear, you cover those. But a lot of the gathering of
                    the news is left to the initiative and resourcefulness of the reporters
                    themselves. You're constantly “pitching a story” to the evening news or the
                    morning news or “Nightline,” with Ted Koppel. My first “Nightline” piece was on
                    the MX missile, which was just becoming a big issue. There were lots of big
                    defense issues to cover because of the Reagan military buildup. We also hit
                    something of a lowpoint with the Soviet Union in the early 1980s, arms control
                    talks broke off, then President Reagan put on the table his so-called Strategic
                    Defense Initiative, which the media started calling Star Wars. The President
                    said this would be a shield to protect Americans from missile attack. We're now
                    hearing echos of that with President Bush's missile defense plans. There were a
                    lot other activities during the Reagan years, including Lebanon, where we had
                    Marines killed in Beirut, and then the invasion of Grenada, then the arms
                    control talks with Reagan and Gorbachev. This was a very active time for
                    coverage of international affairs and defense matters. It was a great time to be
                    reporting from Washington. But that didn't hold a candle to the opportunity of
                    doing this from Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of this was the State Department, the military... Did
                        yofind that you were put in an adversarial way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: No, I actually did not. I had come out of government and I had been
                    part of the Senate majority, then Democratic. But the positions that I had held
                    up until that time had not been of such a high visibility that I was seen as a
                    prominent official of a Democratic persuasion. I found that my contacts in
                    government, the way I was dealt with at the Pentagon, the professional
                    relationships that I had, the friendships I made, were not influenced by the
                    fact that I had been a participant in that process, whether in the Senate on the
                    Foreign Relations Committee and the Intelligence Committee, or at the National
                    Security Council. In some ways, it was helpful. I was able to view the work of
                    government officials with a certain insight into how they went about their jobs
                    unlike some of my colleagues in the media who did not have that perspective. But
                    I never had a sense that there was a concern that I was going to color my
                    reporting based on previous affiliations. I will be quite honest in saying that
                    sometimes I found it difficult to ask government officials questions that I knew
                    they should not be answering, especially if it involved sensitive intelligence
                    matters. There were times that I did not ask those questions.</p>
                <p>Q: When you got out to Geneva, all of these arms control talks have been going on
                    for 20 years. Sometimes the progress is glacial. It really was picking up by the
                    time you were getting there. Let's say you go to Geneva at a particular time.
                    What could you say?</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: It was a set piece. You would film (actually tape) the negotiators
                    entering into the room, shaking hands, and then maybe get a comment or two from
                    some of the participants. In preparation for these trips, I would sit down with
                    government officials in Washington and ask, on background, “What are you
                    expecting from this negotiation,” not asking for their negotiating instructions.
                    They weren't going to give me those. But I would say, “Generally, where are we?
                    What issues are the ones that are most important during this round? What do you
                    expect to hear? Do you expect there may be some movement on the Soviet side?” I
                    would do that with officials in the State Department, Defense Department, the
                    Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, sometimes speaking to their press officers,
                    sometimes speaking to the officials themselves. Then I would go and talk with
                    people outside of government, former officials who were following these talks
                    very closely, like former directors of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
                    or former State Department officials, often interviewing them on camera, asking
                    them in general terms what the stakes were, how important was this round of
                    talks. I would also speak to people at the 'think tanks' like Brookings or
                    Carnegie to get their views, [all of which] I would take to Geneva.</p>
                <p>Once there I would see how the talks unfolded. I would try to get an interview
                    with, for example, the chief U.S. negotiator, Ambassador Max Kampleman. He was
                    quite gracious with his time both on background and on camera. He had the
                    clearest sense of where this story was heading. That is a very important point
                    for government officials. The press should not always be seen as an adversary or
                    a threat. The press can be extremely important and indeed useful in getting a
                    message out about the stakes involved in negotiations, where they're heading,
                    what problems there may be. None of this breaches the confidentiality of the
                    negotiations, but it keeps the American people informed about what is taking
                    place. Some officials like Ambassador Kampleman performed a great service by
                    viewing the press in those terms.</p>
                <p>I did one report while I was covering these talks entitled “Geneva Behind the
                    Scenes.” Kampleman allowed us to sit in on one of his sessions with his own
                    delegation before going to see the Soviet delegation. We did some taping of
                    their discussion, clearly of a general nature, but it gave the sense of 'behind
                    the scenes.' I did a lot of other work associated with that report, including
                    traveling to the Jura mountains outside of Geneva where Paul Nitze and his
                    Soviet counterpart took their so-called “walk in the woods.” We did my on-camera
                    part of the report walking down that path. ABC gave me a liberal amount of timI
                    think it was about four and a half minutefor that report and we received an Emmy
                    nomination.</p>
                <p>Q: I take it the news was taken to be more important than being entertainment,
                    which is more the thrust on at least the major channels now.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I think that that is a fair observation. I think that if you look at
                    the history of TV news, it has increasingly gone from straight reporting, no
                    frills, to information with some entertainment wrappings, to what is now a
                    magazine format like “Dateline NBC” or “Primetime” for ABC. Most of the people
                    dealing with the news today are still striving to get the news out, to inform,
                    while trying to avoid what Ted Koppel once told me to avoid, namely “the MEGO
                    factor.” I said, “What's that?” He said, “It stands for Mine Eyes Glaze Over.”
                    Don't get so into the details that the viewer is going to get lost.
                    Unfortunately today less and less hard information is making its way on the air,
                    replaced by what some call “infotainment.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact in Geneva with the Soviet
                        side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Very little. The Soviet mission in Geneva was beginning to open up a
                    bit. This was the era of glasnost. The Soviet negotiators were pretty savvy
                    about the media. We would go to the Soviet mission when the talks were being
                    held there and would almost always be brought into the waiting room, where the
                    Soviet head of delegation, Viktor Karpov, would be waiting for Ambassador
                    Kampleman to arrive. He would usually have a few comments that we could use in
                    our television reports. He was very good with his English and he was able to
                    express himself very well in “sound bites.” But in terms of any sources, news
                    sources, the Soviets hadn't arrived at that point in their openness
                    campaign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run across from the military and also from the
                        RicharPerles and others that the Soviets were out to get us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: There was a battle of epic proportions being played out during the
                    Reagan years, most vividly captured in a book that Strobe Talbott of Time
                    magazine did called “Deadly Gambits.” It was a story of the two Richards,
                    Richard Perle, the hardliner and so-called Prince of Darkness, and Richard Burt,
                    who was at that point the head of Politico-Military Affairs at State, and later
                    head of our strategic negotiations. The “two Richards” battle was about how we
                    would approach the Soviet Union in the arms control arena. We were aware that
                    this battle was being fought, but at the end of the day, the government had to
                    make decisions, issue instructions for the negotiators, and then head off for
                    Geneva or wherever they were negotiating at that time, and that's where we would
                    catch up with the story. But there was no doubt that there was a battle royal
                    playing itself out.</p>
                <p>Q: Was somebody ever tugging on your sleeve and saying, “You hear what they're
                    doing? Maybe you might be interested in this?” In other words, trying to steer
                    you off to something which was out of the spectrum.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: There was some of that, but quite frankly, those that would be
                    tugging on the sleeve would more often than not tug on the sleeves of reporters
                    aThe Washington Post or The New York Times, knowing that they could put into
                    print a much fuller report than a television correspondent can do in a minute
                    and a half. That's why, for instance, Strobe Talbott was able to piece together
                    this story that became a book. We would get some of that. But quite frankly, to
                    do a television news report on the “two Richards” and the battle they were
                    fighting was a little difficult. Most people out in the country would say, “Wait
                    a minute. I thought we were dealing with the Soviet Union. What is this two
                    Richards story?” I would occasionally make reference to the divisions within the
                    administration and would interview those who would talk on camera about this
                    battle. Often those who were outside the administration would be more free to
                    talk about that. But the real insider story more often appeared on the pages of
                    the Post and the Times than on TV.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the culture between what you were dealing with and the Times and the
                    Post? Did you talk to each other? You had more people... They had more
                    words...</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I think that by and large there was a professional respect for those
                    reporters covering a beat. We knew the job they were doing and certainly
                    respected that. I think that they recognized that even within the limitations of
                    television, we were doing our job of reporting the news as best we could in a
                    small amount of time. We had some very strong reporters like Jack McWethy at
                    ABC, who covered the Pentagon and is still doing national security. He came out
                    of the print side, with U.S. News and World Report. So, some of those people
                    that were now in the TV side of news did their initial reporting on the print
                    side and were as good as anybody that the newspapers could offer. I think where
                    there was a bit of print disdain was when special correspondents, like a Diane
                    Sawyer, would come in to do a story but didn't do any reporting and simply stood
                    in front of the camera and read a script that somebody else had written. That
                    was not from their standpoint, or indeed from mine, what a reporter is
                    about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the preeminent ABC man?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: It was Peter Jennings.</p>
                <p>Q: Still is. These people were sometimes being brought to the scene of something.
                    They may have brought great intelligence and had been around the block a long
                    time, but at the same time, they didn't have a great background.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Let me do a segue on Jennings. Jennings was and is a reporter at
                    heart. He is a person that came up in the business as a newsman. He puts in the
                    hours. He develops his own contacts. Now that he's an anchor, he has less time
                    to walk the corridors, but I have a high regard for him as a reporter. He's a
                    good writer, a good editor. So is Dan Rather and so is Tom Brokaw. But I think
                    that what is of concern is the trend toward getting people that are good on
                    television but haven't had any real reporting experience. That's what we are
                    seeing with these news magazine shows. There is a fear in the profession that we
                    are moving further and further from the real reporters, away from the era of
                    Edward R. Murrow and the “CBS boys.” With the demand for greater news
                    entertainment, with the competition of 100 channels, all of these could, and is,
                    diluting hard news content. I think that the current crop of anchors like
                    Jennings are still holding on to their reporting standards as best they can,
                    but, in the future, who knows?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, I didn't want to get too far into that. When did you
                        go tMoscow? How long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: My family arrived in September of '89. But I had gone over earlier
                    for various reporting assignments, including one that I didn't realize would
                    become so important to me when I became Assistant Secretary of State for South
                    Asia - namely the final Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. I flew to
                    Tashkent, Uzbekistan, and then to the city of Termez, which is along the
                    Uzbek-Afghan border. There the last Soviet troops came across the Friendship
                    Bridge, which spans the Amu Darya River, in their armored personnel carriers.
                    The Soviet commander, General Boris Gromov, walked the last 200 yards across the
                    bridge. Those of us covering this story were very surprised when a woman with
                    flowers ran up to General Gromov. We thought it must be his wife. It turns out
                    she was a Soviet journalist. She gave him the flowers and started doing an
                    interview on the spot! The new Soviet press in action.</p>
                <p>The troops moved from the bridge up a hill to an outdoor stadium where they all
                    came to attention. There were a few speeches by Soviet officials, with these big
                    banners of Lenin in the background. Then all the departing soldiers were handed
                    a watch facwithout the watchband and then they drove off, some with flowers in
                    the barrels of their guns. That was the end of the Soviet military decade and
                    debacle in Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>But this was a moment of hope for Afghanistan. The Soviet era had come to an end.
                    Unfortunately, there was to be no peace for the Afghan people. The Afghan
                    warlords turned their guns on each other. The international community, including
                    the U.S., packed their bags and ten years later, they were still fighting and
                    the Taliban were largely in control.The world would pay a very big price for
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '89 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: '91. That was the period in which Gorbachev tried with a herculean
                    effort to reform the Soviet communist system and found that the rot had simply
                    gone too far and that it was unreformable. Remember that Gorbachev was not
                    trying to overthrow the system. He never turned in his Communist Party card as
                    Yeltsin did. He thought it could be reformed by opening up the political system
                    and perestroika. In the end, he found that it could not be.</p>
                <p>This was also the time of Andrei Sakharov. Gorbachev took the decision to allow
                    him to come back from internal exile in Gorky. Sakharov was so impressive, the
                    moral compass and conscience of the reform movement. I attended meetings where
                    he spoke, where the democrats and the reformers were debating ways to try to
                    open up the system. At the same time, the winds of reform and the possibility,
                    just the glimmer, of breaking free of Moscow were beginning to spread,
                    especially to the Baltic republics. They saw this as their “window of
                    opportunity.” If that window cracked open, they were going to get out as quick
                    as they could.</p>
                <p>Q: When you arrived there in summer of '89, you were the new boy on the block.
                    What were you getting from within the diplomatic corps and the newspaper corps
                    and from important contacts in the State Department? Where was it going at that
                    time?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Interestingly, the Soviet press had become a new source of
                    information. Again, glasnost was allowing stories to be told that the Soviet
                    people had not heard before. There was a magazine called Ogonyok that was
                    rushing stories into print because the editor, Vitaly Korotich, told me no one
                    really knew how long this was going to last.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ogonyuk goes back to the Stalinist time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: It does. Now the magazine was reporting on many of the horror stories
                    of that time, like what happened at Katyn Forest where the Polish soldiers had
                    been murdered by the Soviet NKVD. I had the chance to go there and see that
                    place for myself.But, again, Ogonyok and others were getting the material,
                    printing it and getting it out. They remembered the press thaw that took place
                    under Khrushchev and how it quickly closed off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Prague Spring.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Prague Spring was another example, under Alexander Ducek. But going
                    back to my news “sources” and what they were saying, the Soviet government
                    itself was not exactly filled with a lot of people you could go to. They did
                    have more loquacious and more informative press spokesmen like Gennady
                    Gerasimov, the spokesperson for the Soviet foreign ministry. I remember he came
                    up with the great one-liner “From Yalta to Malta” when President Bush and
                    Gorbachev were about to meet there.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Also, the Russian people could now talk on a more open basis, not just the
                    “think-tank” types like at the USA-Canada Institute, but people literally
                    'on-the-street.' You also had contact with other American and Western
                    journalists, often at the American embassy's cafeteria where we would swap
                    stories over lunch. Ambassador Jack Matlock, who was an excellent ambassador,
                    was also very informative. He had a weekly background briefing for the press,
                    which was quite helpful.</p>
                <p>We also had the ability to do something which journalists in the past could not
                    do: travel on our own. We did not have to be accompanied by a Soviet 'handler.'
                    You did have to get permission to travel. During the time I was there, I was
                    only denied permission twice. In both cases, it was because something was taking
                    place in one of the republics where they said, “Your safety is at risk.” Of
                    course, it also meant that's why we wanted to go there because that would be a
                    story.</p>
                <p>But we were able to travel. I was able to get to 12 of the 15 Soviet republics,
                    flying on Aeroflot at all hours of the day or night. I would take a camera crew
                    with me and a producer and would often have an interpreter/translator as well. I
                    had tried to learn some Russian before leaving. I had three months of Russian
                    language training, which was more than any ABC reporter had ever been given
                    prior to leaving for Moscow. But that was certainly not enough to become
                    anywhere close to fluent. However, I did learn some useful Russian phrases to
                    use, like “I am a journalist, I must be there!”</p>
                <p>We were able to travel far and wide within the Soviet Unioto Siberia, Kazakhstan
                    (to see an underground nuclear test), to Ukraine for a miners' strike, to the
                    Crimean for a story on the return of the Tatars, to Soviet missile silos in the
                    countryside (they were aimed at us) and, especially for me, to the Baltic
                    republics, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania. They started expressing themselves
                    through marches, through actions taken in their parliaments, calling for a
                    return to sovereignty. Eventually all three Baltic states voted to break with
                    Moscow, in one way or another. I was able to be in each of the three parliaments
                    when those votes were taken. It was a remarkable and emotional and inspirational
                    time seeing these people assert their national aspirations, reclaim their past.
                    The original flags of these countries were flown. Moscow could not do anything
                    about it, although some tried to change things in Lithuania, in Vilnius.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was that fight around the TV station.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Yes. I spent a great deal of time in Vilnius during those very tense
                    months. At one point, I got a call at my Moscow apartment to come to the office,
                    immediately. ABC London said, “We need you to go to Vilnius tonight.” I said,
                    “Why tonight?” They said, “There is a report that the Soviet army (which had
                    surrounded the parliament building) was going to try to take over the
                    parliament.” They wanted me and a camera crew to get there and get inside the
                    building and report on it. I said, “Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. You
                    think that there may be an assault by the Soviet military to come in. I'd be in
                    that building. They all have guns.” They said, “Yes, but that's the story.” So,
                    off I went and found my way inside the building, the Lithuanian security guards
                    let us pass. Fortunately, the Soviet army did not attack! But I got an interview
                    that night, about 2:00 o'clock in the morning, with the President of Lithuanian,
                    Vytautas Landsbergis, who was also a music professor. I did a long interview
                    with him on the possibility that something could happen.</p>
                <p>Several years later my wife Merrie and I went to the Meridian House ball, which
                    is held every year here in Washington. We happened to be speaking to the
                    Lithuanian ambassador. I told him what I had done at ABC. He just stopped for a
                    moment and said, “Thank you for all the media did. Thank you for reporting on
                    the independence movement and being there when the Soviets were using their
                    bullying tactics and threatening to use their military force. We're convinced
                    that it was the media and its attention that stopped Moscow from crushing
                    us.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a pretty solid analysis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I believe we made a contribution. But I also believe that for Mikhail
                    Gorbachev and Edouard Shevardnadze, his Foreign Minister, the idea that they
                    would crush the Baltic states with force, as the Soviets had done to Hungary or
                    Poland oCzechoslovakia, I think that was anathema to the two of them, and they
                    would not do it. Gorbachev, of course, went to Vilnius to try to talk them out
                    of their demands for independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember seeing those pictures of him arguing...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: He tried to convince them. He thought that with his force of
                    personality, that if he could just talk to them long enough, that they would
                    finally see that it would be better to stay in the Soviet Union than to leave.
                    He kept saying something to the effect, “This isn't just about sausage. It's not
                    just about a better life. We're trying to reform the Soviet Union. We are a
                    powerful nation. You are a part of this.” Of course, they never accepted that
                    they were a part of it. And Gorbachev and Shevardnadze, to their eternal credit,
                    were determined that they would not use brute force to make them comply, not in
                    the Baltics or in Eastern Europe or in other places that began to assert
                    themselves. Sometimes, as with that TV station in Vilnius, some people were
                    killed. I did not believe that Gorbachev ordered those Soviet troops to fire,
                    but I'm sure that somewhere along the line, it came down the chain of command
                    “Do what you have to do.” But Gorbachev was not going to use Soviet military
                    might to crush these people. That's my own view.</p>
                <p>Q: The Berlin Wall came down. Czechoslovakia and that whole thing. Was the
                    attitude that this was really the end of the world as we knew it?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: It was certainly moving us closer to the end of the Cold War. I had
                    covered Gorbachev's first trip to West Germany, to Bonn, to visit Chancellor
                    Kohl. The reception he received was unbelievable. He was like a rock star. There
                    were giant crowds yelling, “Gorby, Gorby!” Here was an entirely new Soviet
                    leader, and the Germans recognized it. In a press conference I attended at the
                    end of his three day stay, Gorbachev was asked about the Berlin Wall. He said a
                    lot, he always did, but sort of ended with, “Nothing lasts forever.” He didn't
                    say he would tear it down. He didn't say that was his game plan. He simply said,
                    “Nothing lasts forever. We'll have to see.” He basically left open the
                    possibility that history could turn in new and more interesting directions. But
                    the end the Cold War still required the next step, which was the end of the
                    Soviet Union. That played itself out in ways that very few people anticipated,
                    including, I am sure, Gorbachev himself.</p>
                <p>Q: There was always the possibility there, but this was way off in the future.
                    What were you getting from Soviets that you were talking to about Gorbachev?
                    Were you getting a mixed feeling? Were you able to get a different sounding?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Gorbachev started to fall into a “damned if you do, damned if you
                    don't” situation. On one hand, the liberals, the reformers, wanted him to go
                    faster and to make a break. Therefore, they were increasingly aligning
                    themselves with Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin had turned in his Communist Party card.
                    He was quickly becoming the champion of the democrats, the reformers, the
                    liberals. Gorbachev was losing them because he wasn't moving fast enough. But he
                    was also losing the support of those who wanted to retain the systebecause they
                    had certain advantages - the elite within the Soviet Union did pretty welthe
                    so-called apparatchikand Gorbachev was beginning to lose them because they
                    thought he couldn't control this process. That included elements of the military
                    and the KGB.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>So Gorbachev was increasingly seen as somebody that was satisfying neither the
                    liberals and the democrats and reformers on the one hand, nor the hardliners,
                    military, KGB, and the apparatchiks on the other hand. You would hear complaints
                    about him a lot more than you would hear praise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you pass this on through your reportinmaybe not
                        witnames, but saying that this was a confused time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I did lots of reporting, more than 400 reports while I was there. And
                    that was just television. I also filed hundreds of radio spots. You did not have
                    a problem getting your pieces on the air. There was an insatiable appetite at
                    ABC in New York and London. We had two correspondents in Moscow, myself and Jim
                    Laurie, who was a longtime ABC correspondent and very able. Just the two of us,
                    and those working in the bureau, were covering this unfolding, gigantic story
                    for ABC - the meetings and speeches, people in the streets, flags of republics
                    flying that hadn't flown in 50 years, mine workers on strike demanding change in
                    Ukraine. I went down into the coal mines to see the conditions they worked in.
                    Virtually every day there was something to report. There were also some very
                    able Soviet reporters, Russian reporters like Artyom Boravik, who I met on my
                    very first visit to the Soviet Union and later died covering a story. I started
                    making that mental transition from saying Soviet to Russian because so many
                    people there were beginning to shed their Soviet identify and were returning to
                    their Russian roots.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, in all the time I was there, including all the events I covered
                    where Gorbachev was present, I never had an opportunity to actually speak with
                    him and shake his hand. Several years later I went to Moscow as a government
                    official for consultations on the continuing turmoil in Afghanistan and what to
                    do about the Taliban. I had told my daughter Ashley, who was nine when we left
                    Moscow in '91, that I would take her back. She was a little older than Alison
                    and really into the experience and had done a good job of learning some Russian.
                    Both Ashley and Alison had also enjoyed the Anglo-American school, which
                    included kids from many countries. A sign in one of Alison's classes said it
                    best: “Our differences make us special.”</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Anyway, I had promised Ashley a return visit to Moscow and in May, 2000, she was
                    just about to graduate from her high school. So for a graduation present, I had
                    her meet me there. Ashley arrived firsI was in Turkey before coming to Moscoand
                    she stayed for the first couple of days with Irena Rachkovskaya and her family.
                    Irena was the long-time office manager for ABC in Moscow and a good friend. She
                    also had a very handsome and talented son, Alyosha, who happened to be a Bolshoi
                    dancer.After I arrived, Ashley and I stayed as Spaso House at the kind
                    invitation of our Ambassador, Jim Collins. We had three great days in and around
                    Moscow, including driving with Irena to visit Leo Tolstoy's country home near
                    Tula at Yasnaya Ployana. But the highpoint was something I asked Irena to see if
                    she could arrange - a courtesy call on Gorbachev at his foundation. Irena had
                    stayed in close contact with Gorbachev and he was most gracious to see us. What
                    I envisioned would be a 15 minute courtesy call remarkably turned into an hour
                    and a half conversation with this man who had changed the world and will be one
                    of the historic figures of our time! I kept trying to tell him “Thank you for
                    all you did to see the Cold War come to a peaceful end” and how much the world
                    and the United States admired and appreciated the role in had played. He
                    accepted this expression of appreciation, but basically he wanted to talk about
                    what Ashley was interested ihe told her it was a lot more interesting to be a
                    young person in Russia today than in the U.S. because of all that was taking
                    place there - and about U.S.-Russian relations and where they were heading. He
                    made it very clear that he thought the U.S. was not paying adequate attention to
                    Russia, and that Washington was being dismissive of many legitimate Russian
                    concerns. It was vintage Gorbachepersuasive, expressed with conviction, and, as
                    I had observed on so many occasions as a reporter, he did most of the talking!
                    What a wonderful, wonderful opportunity this was to meet this man with my
                    daughter. I should also mention that I only observed one large picture in his
                    offica lovely oil painting of his beloved wife Raisa, his partner in life who
                    had passed away the year before.</p>
                <p>Q: What about Boris Yeltsin? At one point, when Gorbachev was coming to the U.S.,
                    Yeltsin came and he was at that time president. There seemed to be efforts on
                    the part of the American NSC to put him down. It seemed as though you couldn't
                    have two power centers, so Gorbachev was the man and Yeltsin was sort of a fool
                    or a drunk. Did you sense that?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: There was a clear focus on Gorbachev. At that point, Yeltsin had
                    taken a number of important steps like resigning from the Communist Party, but
                    there were also these stories about his sometimes erratic behavior, including
                    one bizarre story when we were in Moscow that had Yeltsin showing up at a police
                    station during the dead of winter, dripping wet with some flowers and saying
                    that he had fallen off a bridge (or something to this effect).</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>When Yelstin came to the U.S., there was a speech he gave at Johns Hopkins in
                    Baltimore. The tape suggests that it either was a bad tape or he was inebriated.
                    The Yeltsin people said he was suffering jetlag and had had some medication. Who
                    knows? But it's clear that the Administration's focus was on Gorbachev, and that
                    Yeltsin and Gorbachev had a very bitter relationship. The Administration
                    therefore kept Yelstin at arms length to not risk offending Gorbachev. Later,
                    Yeltsin returned the favor. During the Yeltsin years, Gorbachev was never
                    welcomed in Washington at the White House. Yeltsin would have taken that very
                    badly if he had been. This had more to do with them than anything else, but it
                    also impacted on how U.S. administrations and presidents would treat them when
                    they were here.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in '91. The Soviet Union hadn't completely
                        comapart at that point, had it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: It was in its final days, but being the insightfureporter that I was,
                    I didn't have a clue! Or much of one, anyway.</p>
                <p>President Bush came to Moscow for a summit with Gorbachev in July of '91. Merrie
                    and I had decided, along with ABC of course, that I would stay for the summit
                    and then return to Washington. The summit went well. I remember being asked on
                    “Good Morning, America” was Gorbachev in charge? “Absolutely,” I said, “He's
                    going to be here for some time.” The next month there was the coup attempt to
                    overthrow him.</p>
                <p>Gorbachev was in the Crimea, on vacation with his family. Some Soviet generals,
                    the head of the KGB, and a few disgruntled politicians in the Politburo seized
                    power. I was already back in the States. I had left Merrie and the girls and the
                    two Russian additions to our familNickie (for Nikolai) our great dog and Marieka
                    our cawith Merrie's family outside of New York in Harrison. I had gone to see my
                    Mother who was in the hospital in Charlotte. On Sunday night, around 11:30, I
                    turned on the news and heard a brief report on how Gorbachev had stepped down
                    for medical reasons and that Gennady Yenayev, the Vice President, had assumed
                    the position of acting president. I thought for a moment, “Well, they do want to
                    show that they have rules and laws and that they can follow their constitutional
                    order.” And then I said to myself, “No way, that's not what's happening.” I
                    called ABC in New York. They had no more information than I did but said, “Stay
                    in touch.” I then called a friend at the Voice of America, Paul Westpheling, who
                    was a broadcaster on the overnight desk. I said, “Paul, here's where I am. Call
                    me if you hear anything.” About 3:30 am the phone rang. Paul said that Gorbachev
                    was under house arrest. I could not get back to sleep. I called ABC again and
                    was told, “You've got to go back to Moscow.” I said I had to check on my
                    Mother's condition and then I would have to go through New York to pick up my
                    passport. The next morning I arrived at London Heathrow. Planes coming out of
                    Moscow were carrying businessmen; the planes going into Moscow were carrying
                    journalists. Every journalist wanted to get in, even though we didn't know if
                    the Soviets would let us stay once we arrived.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I arrived on the second day of the coup, in the early afternoon, and went
                    directly to ABC. Remarkably there had been no problems going through passport
                    control or customs. When I reached the bureau I bumped into Andrei Kozyrev, who
                    was then Yeltsin's top foreign policy adviser and would later become Russia's
                    Foreign Minister. Andrei had just done a live, 2-way interview with Good Morning
                    America. I'm saying to myself, “What kind of coup is this? Why are they allowing
                    the world to see what's taking place here and hear one denunciation after
                    another of their actions?”</p>
                <p>That night everyone expected an assault on the Russian White House where Yeltsin
                    was staying. We were located just across the Moscow River at the Ukraine Hotel
                    with our cameras ready and a phone line open to New York. During the night,
                    there were several people killed nearby, along the Garden Ring Road, but an
                    assault never took place at the White House. The building was ringed by several
                    thousand brave Russian defenders and a few tanks of some of the Soviet troops
                    who had defected to the other side. Earlier Yeltsin had stood atop one of those
                    tanks. That photograph was on the front of every major newspaper around the
                    world. It showed Yeltsin as a courageous leader defending democracy in Russia
                    and would forever define him.</p>
                <p>The next day, the third day, the coup fell apart. The coup plotters, most of whom
                    had been drinking heavily, gave up. The Soviet tanks retraced their route, up
                    Kutusovsky Prospect, right past ABC. Gorbachev returned to Moscow, with a
                    clearly shaken Raisa, on a special plane. The following day, there was a rally
                    at the Russian White House. Yeltsin spoke. People spilled out on the streets and
                    marched to Red Square, unfurling banners of the Russian Federation, not the
                    Soviet Union. I was covering that live via a telephone hookup for “Good Morning,
                    America.” It was like the second Russian revolution.</p>
                <p>The Soviet Union was soon gone. The last day of the Soviet Union was December 25,
                    1991. The hammer and sickle flag came down over the Kremlin and the Russian flag
                    went up. Just a year earlier, at Christmas in 1990, an enormous Christmas tree
                    had been put up at GUM, the huge department store on Red Square. Christmas had
                    certainly not been observed there for a very, very long time. Instead the
                    Soviets would celebrate New Year's with Father Frost and the Snow Princess. But
                    this was Christmas, 1990. Russians were celebrating again. In what can only be
                    described as a surreal experience, here we werMerrie, Ashley, Alison and in Red
                    Square on a very cold but clear night, looking up at this Christmas tree and
                    listening to the Soviet Navy Band playing traditional Christmas carols, although
                    in a somewhat dirge-like fashion. Guess they hadn't had a whole lot of practice!
                    Then the band and the crowd (including us) marched down Red Square to a
                    religious ceremony right in front of St. Basil's Cathedral, right past Lenin's
                    mausoleum. The band was playing “Oh, Little Town of Bethlehem” and “Silent
                    Night.” I couldn't believe it! Reagan's 'Evil Empire' was certainly changing.
                    What an experience this was for all of us.</p>

                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Many of us covering these events thought a lot about the reporters
                    that were there for the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and John Reed and his “Ten
                    Days That Shook the World.” Reed and the others certainly got the first chapter
                    in that storbut we were there to witness the last, and with a remarkable ending.
                    David Remnick, who was working for The Washington Post in Moscow, wrote a great
                    account of this time, entitled “Lenin's Tomb.” It later won the Pulitzer Price.
                    David said in his book: “The last generation of foreign reporters in the Soviet
                    Union was the luckiest.” I was one of those lucky ones.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about '92 then. So you came back and what
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Before leaving I had had a very important conversation with Peter
                    Jennings. He came fairly frequently to anchor from Moscow given all that was
                    happening and he was there for the Bush-Gorbachev summit. At that point we
                    already knew I would be returning to Washington. I wanted to get Peter's advice.
                    We went outside in the stairwell at the bureau. Peter said, “Well, you ought to
                    know one very important thing. We're going domestic.” I said, “And that means?”
                    He said, “Domestic coverage. The Cold War is over. There are a lot of problems
                    in the U.S. education, the economy, etc. We're going to start giving more
                    attention to these. That's going to make it even more difficult for those of you
                    focusing on foreign affairs to get on the air.” Of course I had been focusing
                    for some time on issues like strategic arms control and superpower summits and
                    relations, and now that story was becoming less interesting. Peter's advice was
                    very helpful, even if disappointing for me, and I realized that once I got back
                    it was probably time to start thinking about what I would do after ABC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you think of internalizing yourself, going
                        domestic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: No, if there is one straight line in my career, it has been a focus
                    on international affairs and foreign policy. I did not want to become a
                    “hurricane chaser.” I did not want to start reporting on the budget battles on
                    Capitol Hill. There were others already doing that far better than I could. I
                    had brought a particular area of expertise and interest to ABC. I had been able
                    to do it for 10 years. But it would soon be time to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does a guy who has broadcast experience go from
                        here?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: What I wanted to do was to see if I could continue my interest in the
                    unfolding of the Russian drama. Even though the Soviet Union was no more, the
                    transition of Russia to a form of democracy and a market economy was a major
                    story. I wanted to see if there could be some way for me to stay involved, but
                    in a public policy sense. So, after I left ABC, I started doing some consulting
                    work for the Citizens Democracy Corps, which had several programs underway in
                    Russia, and the Eurasia Foundation, which was just starting up. But most
                    importantly, certainly for the purposes of this discussion, I also got back in
                    touch with Madeleine Albright, who was then the President of the Center for
                    National Policy, a Democratic 'think tank' on Capitol Hill. We had stayed in
                    touch on and off after we worked in the Carter Administration. I spoke to her
                    about the possibility of doing some projects at the Center. One thing we thought
                    was needed was to look at the 1947 National Security Act, which set up the NSC,
                    and examine whether any changes were needed in light of the end of the Cold
                    War.</p>
                <p>So, we started working together again. Madeleine had been very active the
                    previous 10 years in Democratic Party politics, as a foreign policy advisor to
                    Vice President Mondale when he ran for President against Reagan and to Geraldine
                    Ferraro when she was running for Vice President in '84, and to Michael Dukakis
                    in '88. Of course, Democrats had not been very successful in making a run at the
                    White House. But '92 was beginning to look a little different with Bill Clinton.
                    Although Madeleine knew him, she was not able to be directly engaged in that
                    campaign because the Center was a 501c non-profit. But she was certainly one of
                    the prominent Democrats that would be called upon if a Democrat won office and
                    Bill Clinton did.</p>
                <p>After the election, Madeleine was asked by the new President-elect and his team,
                    including Tony Lake and Sandy Berger, if she would join the transition team. She
                    knew of my previous transition team experience for the Carter-Mondale transition
                    in '76 and asked if I would be willing to join her in this new assignment. It
                    took about a nanosecond to say, “Yes.” So we went back to the White House, where
                    we had both worked several years earlier. One of the Secret Service guards at
                    the Northwest Gate even recognized us. Interestingly, our first meeting was with
                    Brent Scowcroft, who was once again the National Security Advisor, this time to
                    President Bush. Sixteen years earlier when I was on the NSC transition team for
                    Jimmy Carter, my first meeting had been with Brent who was then National
                    Security Advisor to Gerald Ford. I'm not sure he wanted to see me again!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Basically during the transition, as I've mentioned earlier, and this
                    is regardless of whether you are doing the NSC, the State Department or the
                    Defense Department, you put together briefing books on policy, on personnel, on
                    structure. In this case, we found the structure of the Bush NSC system was a
                    good one. We did not suggest any major changes. There would continue to be the
                    National Security Council supported by a Principals Committee, under that a
                    Deputies Committee, and interagency working groups. We did proposand this was
                    without knowing who would get the positiothat the U.S. Ambassador to the UN be
                    made a member of the NSC and the Principals Committee, with Cabinet rank. This
                    was intended to be a strong statement and signal of the new Administration's
                    commitment to the UN system and multilateral affairs. All of this became even
                    more significant later when Madeleine was nominated by the President to assume
                    that position, which meant she was going to be one of the key players in U.S.
                    foreign policy during the President's term. Had she not served on the NSC, her
                    job would have been largely in New York. As it was, she split her time between
                    New York and Washington, clearly a factor that allowed her to gain both the
                    experience and the stature to be later tapped to be Secretary of State. So,
                    these initial decisions had longer term consequences certainly for her, and, for
                    that matter, for me. I'll explain that in a moment.</p>
                <p>Tony Lake and Sandy Berger were appointed by the President-elect to be the new
                    National Security Advisor and Deputy National Security Advisor, basically
                    bringing our work on the NSC transition to a close. At that same time, Clinton
                    announced in Little Rock that Madeleine Albright would be his nominee to be the
                    U.S. Ambassador to the UN. Of course, I had been working with her every day. One
                    day I came into our office in the Old EOB and she was not there. There was a lot
                    of speculation that she would get an important position, but no one knew what,
                    including Madeleine. She never really wanted to dwell on that. Around 10:00 that
                    morning the phone rang and it was Madeleine. She said, “I'm in Little Rock.
                    There are going to be some announcements shortly. I just wanted to let you know
                    where I am, that I'm okay.” I said, “Good. I won't tell anyone, but I hope you
                    get what you want.” She said, “I'm very excited.”</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>She returned and soon moved over to the State Department to begin her own
                    transition as the new UN ambassador. She asked if I would join her in New York.
                    I said, “I'll certainly help you,” although we had no idea in what role. As we
                    later learned during the transition, the U.S. has five ambassadors at the U.S.
                    Mission to the United Nations, not just one. The chief U.S. ambassador is known
                    as the Permanent Representative; but you also have the Deputy Permanent
                    Representative, who is usually a career Foreign Service officer; then you have a
                    U.S. Representative for Special Political Affairs; you have a U.S.
                    Representative for the Economic and Social Council [ECOSOC]; and you have a
                    fifth U.S. representative to handle budget and management responsibilities. All
                    five ambassadors are confirmed by the Senate. Madeleine asked me to take on the
                    task of U.S. Representative for Special Political Affairs, which would also
                    serve as a Deputy U.S. Representative on the UN Security Council. In addition, I
                    would be directly responsible for handling peacekeeping activities, which was
                    going to be a major responsibility, and dealing with disarmament matters in the
                    U.N. General Assembly's First Committee. Other things also came up that I would
                    handle, including the question of expansion of the Security Council, which
                    unfortunately did not take place during the four years I was there. So,
                    Madeleine gave me an excellent portfolio and a great office just down from hers,
                    overlooking the United Nations and the East River. This was my first
                    presidential appointment. My confirmation went smoothly. Claiborne Pell, the
                    Senator from Rhode Island, chaired the hearing on my nomination. He has a big
                    supporter of the United Nations. He had attended the San Francisco Conference
                    that founded the UN in June 1945 and carried around a copy of the UN Charter in
                    his pocket ever since. A few weeks later the Senate voted to confirm my
                    nomination and Ambassador Albright presided over my swearing in at her office at
                    the Mission in New York.</p>
                <p>Q: This was a new role for you. This is 1993. How did you see the position of the
                    United States there and what your job was and how people went about it?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: This was a time when there were great hopes for the UN and for
                    peacekeeping. The Cold War was over. Peacekeepers had just a few years earlier
                    been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. President Bush had given a speech at the
                    General Assembly in September of '92 which focused on enhancing UN peacekeeping
                    and was very supportive in terms of the U.S. role. I remember, during the
                    transition, we looked at the fact that the U.S. was behind in paying its dues to
                    the UN. President Bush had proposed a three year payback for those arrears. We
                    thought, “Why should it take that long? Let's pay this off right away. We should
                    be paying our dues on time and in full.” A certain naivete there. Congress would
                    prove to be a big obstacle in this regard. Ambassador Albright also referred at
                    this time to a policy of “assertive multilateralism,” meaning that while the
                    United States would continue to play the leading role in the post-Cold War
                    world, we also intended to work multilaterally with others, and to be assertive
                    about it. In other words, we were not going to be the 'Lone Ranger' in foreign
                    policy; we wanted to work with others to achieve our common aims and goals,
                    including with the UN. So, it was a very positive approach that we took to New
                    York.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>But there were also two looming problems. The immediate issue was what was
                    happening in Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia and, specifically, what to do
                    about Milosevic and the attempt by the Serbs to “ethnically cleanse” Bosnia.
                    Everyone was reading these horror stories in the press about the Balkans. The
                    Balkans were at war. What would happen to Kosovo and Macedonia and Croatia? This
                    was part of the breakup, the fallout if you will, of the end of the Cold War and
                    the end of the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia was disintegrating. At the request of
                    the UN Secretary-General, former Secretary Cyrus Vance and former British
                    Foreign Secretary David Owen had pulled together the Vance-Owen Plan to deal
                    with it.</p>
                <p>The very first meeting that I attended with Madeleine in New York was one for the
                    P5 [Permanent Five] members of the Security Councithe U.S., Russia, China, the
                    France, and Britain. We met at the French mission, which was located on the 54th
                    floor of a building near the UN and had a spectacular view of all of Manhattan
                    and beyond. At the meeting were Cyrus Vance and David Owen to brief the P5
                    members on where things stood. I must admit that I was pretty awed by thiI had
                    until just recently been working on the transition team in Washington and not
                    too long before that at ABC News and all of a sudden I was in this diplomatic
                    setting with the Ambassadors from Russia, China, France, and the UK, all very
                    senior, seasoned diplomats. I remember thinking to myself: “I've got a lot of
                    learning to do, quick, and a lot of listening.”</p>
                <p>At the same time, Ambassador Albright was also new to diplomacy and she knew that
                    she had a lot of work to do to take on her new responsibilities. She was
                    inexhaustible in doing so. That meeting was also very interesting because
                    throughout her four-year stay in New York, Madeleine Albright took this issue
                    head-on - Bosnia, Serbia, Milosevic, Croatia, Tudjman, UNPROFOR, setting up the
                    War Crimes Tribunals, and the hours and hours of debate and resolutions in the
                    Security Council trying to find some way to end the conflict, calling on
                    Belgrade to stop its aggressive action. I think more than any other single
                    issue, this defined her role at the UN and later as Secretary of State. She was
                    determined to see America use its influence in whatever way it could, initially
                    through diplomacy and dropping in food supplies to those who were being starved
                    by Milosevic's thugs, and later by military force through NATO action. This is a
                    story she will need to tell in her own words. But I think that her major policy
                    legacy, the one that will most define her eight years in government in the
                    Clinton Administration, will be the advise she gave and the actions she
                    initiated with respect to sorting out the tragedy in the Balkans.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>In addition to Bosnia, there was another looming issue that we confronted upon
                    arriving in New York. Prior to leaving office, President Bush had dispatched a
                    U.S. humanitarian mission to Somalia. CNN had shown the world the terrible
                    scenes of starving Somalis and the warlords that were not letting the food get
                    through. President Bush and his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin
                    Powell, were right in my view to undertake that mission. Once the humanitarian
                    situation had stabilized and the new Administration had come to office, the
                    question was, what next for Somalia? Decisions were taken, in Washington and the
                    United Nations, to broaden that humanitarian mission to help Somalia try to
                    re-build itself - some termed it “nation building.” There was the feeling that
                    if more was not done for Somalia, then in a couple of years if not sooner the
                    international community would be back again with another humanitarian crisis on
                    its hands. Something had to be done to help the Somalis reconstitute an
                    effective government. Unfortunately, that effort moved in ways that had
                    unforeseen and tragic consequences. Toward the end of the U.S. involvement,
                    there was the death of the American Army Rangers. That incident was later
                    captured in the book and movie “Black Hawk Down.” It was a sad final chapter to
                    what had begun as a truly humanitarian efforand one for which we are still
                    trying to learn the appropriate lessons. The biggest loser in all this was the
                    Somali people. I went there with Madeleine on a mission in the summer of '93. I
                    had never seen such a desperate placMogadishu was basically a destroyed city.
                    For a moment the international community and the U.S. were there to help but,
                    for many, many reasons that effort failed. And Somalia is still, many years
                    later, a desperate place, and a failed state.</p>
                <p>But the fact is that all these things were taking place when we arrived at the
                    UN. They were front and center in terms of U.S. foreign policy. So, working at
                    the U.S. Mission in New York was not going to be a backwater. And because of my
                    peacekeeping assignment, I also had the advantage of working closely with the UN
                    official who was then the head of the Peacekeeping Department. His name was Kofi
                    Annan. He was an Under Secretary General. I spent hours with him and grew to
                    admire him enormously and also to like him as a friend. Therefore, I was
                    delighted that he later became Secretary General of the UN and I hope will soon
                    have a second term.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: It would have been January 1993 to August 1997, at which time I
                    assumed my position as Assistant Secretary for South Asia. I initially went to
                    New York thinking it would be for two years. I was commuting from our home in
                    Arlington, flying up every Monday morning on the shuttle and returning Friday
                    night. We had thought about moving there, but Merrie and our girls had just
                    recently returned from Russia and we all thought it was best to say in our home
                    in Arlington with our friends and not try another major re-adjustment at that
                    time. My older daughter, Jeannie, was living in the area as well. So, for family
                    reasons and also because my wife was working on Capitol Hill as a legislative
                    consultant, I became a frequent flyer. Actually, it worked out quite well and
                    what we thought would be two years turned into a third year and then a fourth.
                    So we came to see New York as a second home, and one we really enjoyed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've talked about the '93-'97 period when you were
                        ambassadoto the UN for Special Political Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is June 1, 2001. Why don't we talk about how you saw the U.S. and the UN at
                    that time? What were the problems? How did the Clinton administration, Madeleine
                    Albright, and Congress deal with this situation?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I think we saw the UN as being an important component of U.S. policy,
                    now and for the future. We were coming out of the end of the Cold War and the
                    end of the East-West division. Both had enormous implications for the UN.</p>
                <p>The UN had been a Cold War battlefield. The Soviet Union was there with its veto.
                    Whenever things got difficult around the world, these things were brought to the
                    UN and the U.S. and the Soviet Union would battle it out in the Security
                    Council. The end of the Cold War meant something remarkable happened. Russia
                    became a potential partner of the U.S. in the Security Council. Indeed, one of
                    the important things that Madeleine Albright did after taking over as the
                    Permanent Representative was to institute a monthly breakfast or luncheon
                    meeting with the Russian and U.S. delegations, first when Yuli Voronstov was the
                    Russian Ambassador and then with Ambassador Sergei Lavrov when he took over. We
                    would meet “five on five,” the five top officials of each mission. That
                    certainly did not happen during the Cold War! We were now working with the
                    Russians in the Security Council in ways that would have been impossible just a
                    few short years before.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>There was also the feeling that the international community could do more to meet
                    urgent needs around the world. UN peacekeepers had received the Nobel Peace
                    Prize in 1989 for the work they were doing, Secretary General Boutros-Ghali had
                    issued an important report entitled “An Agenda for Peace” that spelled out new
                    opportunities for the United Nations in conflict resolution. There was an
                    increasing recognition that a great deal of the conflict taking place in the
                    world was no longer interstate but intrastate, taking place within borders, and
                    that for humanitarian or other reasons some international response was required.
                    That response could range from simply calling international attention to the
                    problems or imposing sanctions or sending in peacekeepers under so-called
                    Chapter 6 or Chapter 7 conditions.</p>
                <p>As I think I mentioned earlier, just before the 1992 presidential election,
                    President Bush had delivered his annual address to the UN General Assembly and
                    had laid out a very full agenda for how the U.S. could assist with UN
                    peacekeeping. We wanted to build on that. It was a good statement and we felt
                    that it should be possible to find other ways in which the U.S. could assist in
                    peacekeeping requirements around the world. When I say that, I should also add
                    that it was not the view of the new Administration that the U.S. should take on
                    all causes and settle all conflicts. Clearly, there would be restrictions on
                    U.S. activities. Clearly U.S. national interests had to be identified and taken
                    into account. But, again, the view was that the UN could do things around the
                    world that the U.S. and other nations could and should support in this new
                    post-Cold War environment. Quite frankly, that would lessen the burden or
                    expectation that the United States would always have to respond to the
                    international 911 call, as Ambassador Albright used to put it. And that is why
                    the UN continues to be an important instrument for the U.S. and other countries.
                    The reality of the UN, however, was also that this was a large institution that,
                    over time, had become one that was clearly in need of significant reform in its
                    practices. It was receiving a great deal of criticism that it was filled with
                    patronage, that it was inefficient, that there was a lot of waste and, in some
                    cases, corruption. The UN was in need of a healthy dose of reform. The Clinton
                    Administration, and Madeleine Albright, recognized that. But the feeling on
                    Capitol Hill was that unless there were certain steps taken to reform, then the
                    U.S. would not meet its financial obligations, which was putting us further and
                    further into debt. So, we really did get into a Catch 22, which was unless the
                    UN reformed, it would not get full U.S. financial support, but we would not
                    provide that support unless we saw the reform.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it really “Reform these or we'll hold our money back”
                        or wathere another agenda which was those who were really opposed to the
                        UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I think underlying this is a fundamental issue, especially for some
                    conservatives like Senator Jesse Helms, of whether the U.S. should in fact be a
                    part of the UN system. Does it infringe upon our sovereignty? Is this a step
                    toward so-called “world government?” Of course, concerns abou“entangling
                    alliances” go back to our founding fathers and George Washington and his
                    Farewell Address. That strain of American political thought has a long history.
                    But in the modern era in which we live, in the aftermath of World War II, the
                    creation of the UN was meant to be a forum and a mechanism to allow us to
                    address difficult issues together. Remember, to end the “scourge of war” was a
                    central part of the UN Charter. But a lot of American conservatives have simply
                    never accepted the view that we should be a part of that international system.
                    Indeed during the Reagan administration, one U.S. representative said very
                    proudly that if the UN wished to leave New York, he would be on the pier to
                    gladly wave it goodbye.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was early Reagan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Yes, under the tenure of Ambassador Kirkpatrick. She was not the one
                    to make that statement, but I do not believe she refuted it. The fact is that,
                    yes, there are occasions when the U.S. will have to act in its own interest and
                    unilaterally if necessary. But in the view of myself and others, that does not
                    mean that we should not work multilaterally on problems where it serves U.S.
                    interests. Q: When you went there early on right at the beginning of the Clinton
                    administration, the Clinton administration was elected on the economy. Foreign
                    affairs was considered to be a secondary thing. At least this seemed to be where
                    the focus of the campaign was. How did you feel? You were the new boy on the
                    block watching his team get together. How did you feel... Was the commitment
                    from Clinton and within the White House NSC to Secretary of State Christopher...
                    Did you feel there was support for the UN, enthusiastic or just support?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I think that there was certainly support from the President and from
                    the new Secretary of State, Warren Christopher. The fact that Madeleine
                    Albright, as the UN ambassador, was included on the National Security Council
                    and given Cabinet rank insured that she would be a key player in the Clinton
                    administration and in the foreign policy making process. The current Bush
                    administration has downgraded the role of the UN ambassador, not including that
                    position on the NSC, or giving it Cabinet status. Each administration makes its
                    own determination, and sends its own signals about how it views the UN and
                    multilateralism in general.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Now, you're also righthe Clinton Administration was elected on the economy, and
                    for good reason. The Cold War had ended and there was a feeling that as with the
                    end of any war, hot or cold, now was the time to address unmet domestic needs.
                    There were concerns about the economy, about education, about infrastructure,
                    about the competition in the world economy with Japan and Europe. There were
                    books saying the U.S. was falling behind and could not compete. So, this is
                    where President Clinton intended to devote his primary attention.</p>
                <p>There was also the hope that without the adversarial relationship with the Soviet
                    Union, the U.S. could do more with the international community and the United
                    Nations could play a greater role, whether in dealing with Iraq in the aftermath
                    of the Gulf War and UN inspections for weapons of mass destruction, or the
                    humanitarian crisis in Somalia, or the ongoing tragedy that was taking place in
                    the former Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>Q: How did Madeleine Albright deal with the professional staff within the UN with
                    the U.S. UN Mission? I'm talking about initially as you started taking
                    charge?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Even though the U.S. mission in New York is on American soil, it is,
                    in effect, an embassy. Under the Ambassador, who serves as Chief of Mission, you
                    have a DCM, a political counselor and a political section and an economic
                    section. You probably do more diplomacy there than in virtually any other U.S.
                    embassy around the world because you're dealing with over 180 countries and with
                    the world's preeminent international organization, the UN and its specialized
                    agencies like UNICEF. Madeleine Albright came to this assignment with some
                    government experience but clearly this was her highest office. As it turned out,
                    and this was one of the most interesting things, it was the perfect training for
                    her subsequent appointment to be Secretary of State. She dealt with
                    representatives from all over the world in New York; traveled extensively to
                    Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America; and developed a set of contacts with
                    officials from other governments who had been or would soon become their
                    nation's Foreign Ministers.</p>
                <p>It's interesting that while the U.S. has had a long line of high level,
                    distinguished appointments to the UN, that has not always been a stepping stone
                    to higher positions. Earlier it was sort of seen as a capstone to a career. That
                    may be changing. Of course the first President Bush was UN ambassador earlier in
                    his career. Senator Moynihan was a former U.S. ambassador. Madeleine became the
                    Secretary of State. Richard Holbooke, who followed Madeleine, and then Bill
                    Richardson at the UN under President Clinton, was likely to be tapped to be
                    Secretary of State if Al Gore had won the 2000 election.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>We had an excellent U.S. Mission staff. Madeleine was very pleased with her DCM,
                    Ned Walker, who would later become our Ambassador to Egypt and Israel and then
                    Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs when she came to Washington as
                    Secretary. Ned was replaced by another outstanding career officer, Ambassador
                    Skip Gnehm. Robert Gray was her political counselor, who later went to Geneva as
                    the U.S. Representative to the Conference on Disarmament. Cameron Hume took his
                    place and later became our Ambassador to Algeria. Both Bob and Cameron was
                    nominated for their ambassador posts by Madeleine. We had very good career
                    professionals at the Mission in New York, although it was sometimes difficult to
                    get them. New York is an expensive place for people to live, especially if you
                    are on a government salary.</p>
                <p>But, again, the assignment in New York proved to be an excellent training ground
                    for Madeleine Albright and, I should add, for me as well in terms of exposure to
                    international diplomacy. That experience would serve me very well when I moved
                    on to my next assignment as an assistant secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the relationship between the U.S. UN
                        Mission anthe IO [International Organizations] Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Over the years that relationship has gone through various
                    permutations. Ambassador Albright's immediate predecessor was Ambassador
                    Perkins, who was not a part of the NSC process or a member of the first
                    President Bush's cabinet. Therefore, he operated as most Ambassadors do abroad,
                    receiving instructions from the State Department and the Secretary of State and
                    responding to and working through the appropriate bureau and assistant
                    secretary, in this case IO, International Organizations. With the new
                    administration, IO had to adjust to the fact that Ambassador Albright had
                    additional responsibilities and authority. While working closely with the
                    bureau, she would not be answering, as it were, to the bureau. She would be
                    operating under the Secretary of State, in this case Warren Christopher, and
                    dealing directly with him. She and Christopher got along very well. I am not
                    aware of a single policy statement of importance that she made without first
                    checking with “Chris,” as she called him, or his office. They had a good working
                    relationship. But IO initially thoughand not surprisinglthat the U.S. mission
                    under the new administration would fall into the same pattern of working through
                    IO on all matters and receive instructions. It did require a couple of phone
                    calls to the Acting Assistant Secretary of State for International
                    Organizations, George Ward, to make sure they understood that some adjustments
                    would be required. I'm trying to say this diplomatically. The IO Bureau and its
                    new Assistant Secretary, Doug Bennewho was an old friend and former colleague of
                    Madeleine's - adjusted.</p>

                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Fortunately, to use the nuclear metaphor, there was very little
                    fallout. After a several week period of getting adjusted to each other, things
                    went fine from there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the issues that landed in the Clinton lap was the
                        Somalithing. Did you get involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I did and have some very strong views on that. It is an important
                    case study in post-Cold War diplomacy, and can be seen in the category of the
                    “the hell of good intentions.”</p>
                <p>The Bush Administration took the correct decision to go into Somalia and it was
                    for the right reasons. It was a humanitarian emergency. I also think the Clinton
                    Administration's intentions were right to see this turned over to the UN and to
                    see what could be done t“fix” Somalia so that there would not be a repeat
                    occurrence. Clearly, the humanitarian intervention saved hundreds of thousands
                    of lives. In that sense, Somalia was a success. But, as we learned, the cause of
                    the crisis was as much political as anything else - the fighting among the
                    Somali warlords and clans had put the people of Somalia at great risk. So, the
                    new Administration came in and there was a handoff to a UN-led mission, and then
                    the question was how to assist Somalia. There were many unintended consequences
                    that flowed from the U.S. and UN decision to become more directly involved in
                    Somali affairs, including the reaction of one of the strongest warlords, General
                    Aideed. He saw this as an effort to squeeze him out of the political process, to
                    marginalize him. Aideed hit back and he hit back hard. Initially Pakistani
                    peacekeepers paid the pric24 were killed in an ambush. Later American lives we
                    lost, in the “Black Hawk Down” episode I mentioned earlier.</p>
                <p>Q: Did the fact that we had these losses and it was considered to be irrespective
                    of the real humanitarian benefit... The impression was that we got into
                    something bigger than we could deal with. Did that leave a real mark on our
                    view? Did you all have Somalia engraved in your hearts when they would talk
                    about other crises such as Bosnia and Rwanda? Was this pretty much almost in the
                    foreground of your thinking?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: It certainly was part of our thinking. But we did not have such a
                    strong over-reaction to say, “Well, the U.S. is closing up shop in terms of
                    support for multilateral intervention.” We simply had to learn how to do this
                    the right way in the future.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>I also want to mention one other thing here. One of the proudest moments I had
                    during this whole tragic period came after the decision was taken by President
                    Clinton to withdraw U.S. forces from Somalia. The Congress and public opinion
                    were very much in favor of us getting out. The UN tried to keep the operation
                    going, but it wasn't working. So, the UN decided to leave as well. I was part of
                    a Security Council mission of seven Ambassadors to travel to Mogadishu to meet
                    with General Aideed, who had successfully eluded capture by the Rangers and
                    others after he had ordered the attack on the Pakistanis, which had really
                    started the most intense cycle of violence. We went to see General Aideed at his
                    headquarters, which was surrounded by his militia forces, to say that the UN was
                    leaving and to make it clear that the international community expected that the
                    remaining UN personnel would be allowed to leave peacefully and not under
                    attack. We asked for his assurance, which he gave. Fortunately, that's what took
                    place. But the UN wasn't going to let matters solely rest in Aideed's hands.
                    Kofi Annan, who was then the head of the peacekeeping department, asked me to
                    see him at one point and said that it was essential that the U.S. provide some
                    “over the horizon” military support for the withdrawal of UN troops because, if
                    it turned ugly, they needed the most professional force available to assist. He
                    fully recognized that the U.S. had already made a determination that U.S. forces
                    were out of Somalia, and that any return would be politically difficult for the
                    President. Madeleine Albright took that request back to Washington. There were
                    several high level meetings. Her argument, and it was the right one, was that we
                    had a responsibility to assist in the withdrawal of these UN troops since we had
                    encouraged many countries, including Pakistan and India and others, to put
                    troops there for peacekeeping purposes in the first place. The decision was made
                    by President Clinton that the U.S. would send U.S. forceMarines led by General
                    Tony Zinni - to assist with that withdrawal and to be available if needed. The
                    Pakistani ambassador at that time was Ambassador Jamsheed Marker. Pakistan had
                    suffered even greater losses in Somalia than the U.S. Marker called me to say
                    how much he appreciated hearing the news that the U.S. would return to Somalia
                    for the purposes of protecting the withdrawal and then he added, “But I never
                    doubted that the U.S. would.” It was exactly the right kind of decision that a
                    Great Power takes.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>However, there was a further consequence of Somalia. In a short period of time,
                    Rwanda, that terrible conflict between the Hutus and Tutsis, took place. It
                    quickly became a genocide costing hundreds of thousands of lives. We can't go
                    into the long history of that conflict here. But there is no doubt that the
                    Somali experience did have a profound influence on the degree to which the U.S.
                    would become actively involved in what was happening in Rwanda. The instructions
                    we received in New York once the fighting erupted was to basically see the UN
                    pull out its small peacekeeping force. We argued against that, saying there had
                    to be some international presence there, but the question of actually going in
                    with a large intervention force a la Somalia was never, to my knowledge, given
                    active consideration in Washington. How would you do it? Who does it? What is
                    the best way to proceed? With Rwanda coming so quickly after what had happened
                    in Somalia, U.S. forces were not going to take the lead in a military
                    expedition. Several years later President Clinton traveled to Kigali, to Rwanda,
                    and said the international communitand the U.S. - should have done more and that
                    we must never let such a thing happen again. I have often wondered how the U.S.
                    and the UN would respond to such a crisis today.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you see any reflection in the early Clinton years... A good number of the
                    Clinton people who came in with the campaign were coming out of the anti-Vietnam
                    generation. There were reports of not being very appreciative of the military.
                    Did you see some reflections of this?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: There were reports in “The Washington Post” early on about some
                    disrespect shown by a couple of White House staff to the military. I can
                    honestly say I saw no evidence of that, certainly from my vantage point working
                    in New York that never occurred. In fact, we had a very good relationship with
                    the military at the U.S. Mission. We had a military attache assigned there,
                    Colonel Bill Clontz, who was very helpful. And the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs,
                    General John Shalikashvili, who took over from Colin Powell, came to New York as
                    one of his first appointments to meet with Ambassador Albright. He told her that
                    he wanted to assign one of his senior officers on the Joint Chiefs staff,
                    General Barry McCaffrey, to be his point of contact with her. Later, General
                    Wesley Clark was given that responsibility. That relationship with Clark would
                    become especially valuable after Madeleine became Secretary of State and Wes
                    became NATO Commander. Together they played a very important role in the Kosovo
                    war.</p>
                <p>But going back to your question, the fact that many of us in the Clinton
                    Administration had opposed the Vietnam War, including the President himself, did
                    not, in my view, color our view of the military. Indeed some have argued that
                    had our military leaders been listened to more carefully during Vietnam, perhaps
                    we would not have made as many mistakes as we did. They were the ones who were
                    actually seeing what was happening on the ground, a lot more than the civilian
                    leadership.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>Q: On the reverse side, how did you find the military looking upon peacekeeping
                    operations? We had developed under Colin Powell and others that you almost have
                    to have almost absolutely everything assured you committed any troops, which
                    doesn't make any sense in peacekeeping. Did you find sort of an
                    anti-peacekeeping attitude?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I wouldn't call it an anti-peacekeeping attitude. But it was clear
                    the military itself, again in this post-Cold War world, was attempting to
                    determine its role and mission in a new environment in which we did not have the
                    Soviet Red Army facing us across Europe and the Iron Curtain. Now we were
                    beginning to see a lot of conflicts taking place, many of which had been
                    submerged or simmering during the Cold War period. The former Yugoslavia is the
                    best example. Tito held it together, but after he was gone and the Cold War was
                    history, this country just broke apart. Then the question was, how do we respond
                    to that? The military has one primary mission above and beyond all others, which
                    is to be prepared to defend the U.S. and fight a war if necessary. It's very
                    simple. That's the mission. But in today's world, where the U.S. is the leading
                    international actor, what role does the U.S. play in trying to see that other
                    conflicts do not take place or spread in ways that could endanger U.S.
                    interests? How much can and should we do, while not detracting from the
                    military's primary purpose? This is still playing itself out, including with the
                    new Administration. Secretary Rumsfeld is asking whether we should be in the
                    Sinai, or in the Balkans peacekeeping force with NATO. Secretary Powell says to
                    our allies, “We went into the Balkans together. We will come out together.” So,
                    there is already tension there.</p>
                <p>I think many in the military recognize that today's world will require new
                    missions, new training and new skills. Soldiers will need to be trained for what
                    is a very difficult task of peacekeeper, particularly when you're not in a
                    benign environment. Peacekeeping is no longer going to be confined to the old
                    observer missions, as in the earlier days of the UN. Peacekeeping now is very
                    complex and at times very dangerous. It is civil-military relations, it is
                    psychological; it is often humanitarian; it is training others to do landmine
                    removal. I do not believe our military has a reluctance to take on these
                    additional tasks as long as they do not impair their ability to perform their
                    most important function should the need arise. There are also quality of life
                    concerns about servicemen and women being away from home for long periods of
                    time and under difficult circumstances. Those issues must be addressed. But I do
                    not find the military to be an opponent of taking on the new challenges that we
                    face.</p>
                <p>Q: After the Somali problem developed and we pulled out, was there a time of
                    reflection, of the UN staff and some American military sitting together and
                    figuring out what we had done right and wrong?</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: There were a number of efforts made to learn the lessons of
                    Somaliconferences, meetings, seminars, books have been written on the subject.
                    Work along these lines was undertaken by Kofi Annan in the Department of
                    Peacekeeping Operations [DPKO]. There have also been several examinations about
                    Rwanda and what went wrong there. The learning curve on peacekeeping has not
                    flattened out.</p>
                <p>Q: On Rwanda, were there within the USUN Mission conflicting opinions or was it
                    generally said that, “We've got to stay out of this. Africa is...”</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: No, I think the U.S. Mission knew we had to do something. We were in
                    day-to-day contact with the very strong views being expressed by members of the
                    Security Council that the UN had to be doing more, that it couldn't just stand
                    by and pull out when the Hutu hate radio was calling for the killing of the
                    Tutsis. It was becoming clear a genocide was underway. Many members of the
                    Security Council were demanding that a resolution be passed authorizing a UN
                    Chapter 7 intervention, meaning the use of force was authorized. The U.S. was
                    the country in the Security CounciI sat in the chair for a large part of this
                    when Ambassador Albright was not in New Yorthat kept asking questions about how
                    we would do this, who would do it, and under what conditions. Washington made it
                    clear that we would not pass a resolution without those questions answered.</p>
                <p>Some other countries supported that position, but many countries did not,
                    including New Zealand whose Ambassador, Colin Keating, was absolutely adamant
                    that this was an abdication of international responsibility, thousands of people
                    were being killed, and that the UN had to go in. But the U.S. had recently
                    completed an internal review of peacekeepinknown as Presidential Decision
                    Directive [PDD] 2and it required the U.S. to be clear about the proposed
                    peacekeeping mission, how it would be accomplished, how much it would cost,
                    whether U.S. forces would be required, what would be the exit strategy, whether
                    any U.S. forces would be under UN Command (many Members of Congress were
                    strongly opposed to this on sovereignty grounds). The questions we posed in the
                    Security Council were not ones that some countries wanted to hear. They simply
                    wanted something to be done. They also knew that the only country capable of
                    doing it was the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't Canada involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Yes, they have a very strong peacekeeping tradition, but I don't
                    believe Canada was on the Security Council at that point. After some time, the
                    French came forward with Operation Turqoise to provide sanctuary in a part of
                    Rwanda. The U.S. and others supported the French taking that role, with UN
                    Security Council blessing. Later, the U.S. military did get involved in terms of
                    providing humanitarian assistance to the thousands and thousands of people
                    displaced by the conflict. But that was after a large part of the killing had
                    ceased.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Q: Our position was that we have to meet certain points and understand, which
                    makes absolute sense, but the problem is that in a lot of crises by the time you
                    get around to doing something, it's over and the damage is done.</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: That's right. As I mentioned earlier, at the beginning of the crisis
                    we received instructions from Washington to call for the UN to pull out its
                    entire peacekeeping contingent, which was small, from Kigali, the capital of
                    Rwanda. Those of us at the U.S. Mission felt that this simply should not be
                    done, including Ambassador Albright. The peacekeepers did not appear to be in
                    danger and perhaps they could help in some fashion. That Washington instruction
                    was turned around after several very heated phone calls. The small UN presence
                    was able to maintain itself there and did so usefully and then expanded over a
                    period of time. But it was a very difficult. This was almost certainly the most
                    difficult time for any of us at the U.S. Mission during that first term.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find a change in how we approached these things? Over a period of
                    time, the NGOs have become quite adept at dealing with refugees, dealing with
                    food, health, etc. There has been a tendency prior to particularly Rwanda of the
                    NGOs will come in later on but not be in at the beginning. Did you find that the
                    U.S. and the UN was really making the NGOs part of any operation?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I think that NGOs were beginninat least from my own observationto be
                    the one constant in many of these countries in conflict. They were often there
                    before the crises erupted, would stay as best they could while they were going
                    on, and would stay behind after the international community had come and gone.
                    For instance, in Somalia, they stayed after everyone left. Increasingly, NGOs
                    like Doctors Without Borders, CARE, Mercy Corps, and so many others are playing
                    critical roles in these conflict areas, providing desperately needed
                    humanitarian and social assistance. This, too, is a further by product of the
                    world we live in today, in the post-Cold War world. NGOs see that governments
                    cannot or will not respond to all crises and that there is a need for a constant
                    presence by them. It's dangerous work. They ought to be commended for what they
                    do.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your position as ambassador for Special Political
                        Affairs,what else was on your plate when you took over?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: One thing that became a major focus of my work at the UN was the
                    humanitarian crisis around the world posed by land mines. When Ambassador
                    Albright and I went to Somalia and Cambodia in July of 1993 to see two
                    peacekeeping operations, we received briefing materials that referred to the
                    large number of landmine victims. One number continues to stick in my mind. In
                    Cambodia, one out of every 236 Cambodians is a landmine victim. Once we got to
                    Somalia, we received more information, but because of the security situation
                    there we were not able to get out beyond the UN compound, except by helicopter.
                    So we really didn't get to see the people there, only the destruction that the
                    continued fighting had caused. Admiral Jonathan Howe, who was the UN special
                    representative, thought it was just too dangerous although we were able to fly
                    to Kismayu in the southern part of Somalia to see an effort being made to
                    establish a local government council.</p>
                <p>But when we got to Cambodia, we saw the reality of the landmine crisis. Coming in
                    from the airport in Phnom Penh, you could see the amputees virtually everywhere
                    you looked. Charlie Twining, the U.S. Ambassador there, briefed us on the work
                    that was being done on demining and efforts to try to restore the lives of those
                    who had survived these land mines. Millions had been laid over the many years of
                    conflict, especially during the Khmer Rouge period and Pol Pot. When we departed
                    Cambodia, Ambassador Albright said to me, “When we get back to New York, let's
                    see what can be done about this from our vantage point.”Once back at the U.S.
                    Mission, I started looking into this and quickly learned that there was a U.S.
                    senator from Vermont, Patrick Leahy, who was very involved with this. He was
                    pushing a ban on the export of anti-personnel land mines, and had gotten that
                    through Congress. We decided that we would try to have a resolution adopted by
                    the General Assembly that would call for an international ban on the export of
                    land mines. That was the first of four resolutions we wrote and sponsored during
                    my stay in New York. Every year we tried to strengthen the resolution. The
                    second yeaand this required a great deal of work in Washington within the NSC
                    system - we were able to call for the “eventual elimination” of landmines.
                    President Clinton included that call in his annual speech to the General
                    Assembly. It was a real breakthrougthe first time a president had gone on record
                    that these weapons should be eliminated worldwide. A lot of people didn't think
                    that this was a realistic objective because landmines are cheap to make and very
                    hard to detect. But because of the estimated 26,000 people a year killed and
                    injured by land mines - most of them civilians - and because landmines are left
                    to explode for years and years after the war or conflict is over, there was the
                    strong view that these indiscriminate killers should be banned for all time,
                    like poison gas was after World War I. By the end of 1996, our resolution called
                    for a binding international agreement to ban land mineincluding their
                    production, stockpiling, export and use. We were able to get more than 100
                    countries to co-sponsor that resolution. Over 150 voted in favor of it, with a
                    few abstaining.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Also at this time the International Campaign to Ban Landmines was picking up
                    speed, led by Bobby Muller of the Vietnam Veterans Foundation and Jody Williams.
                    That campaign and Jody, who I got to know well, later won the Nobel Peace Prize
                    for their efforts. The Canadian government also got very involved.
                    Unfortunately, once the point was reached that an international agreement to ban
                    landmines was actually being drafted, the U.S. was unable to go along with it
                    because of U.S. military reservations about the use of land mines, especially
                    along the DMZ separating the two Koreas. President Clinton determined that we
                    could not sign the treaty until those military concerns were met. So, we
                    actually got ahead of ourselves on thiwhat we were saying about an international
                    treaty and what we could actually do. But our efforts, including at the UN, did
                    have the effect of prompting other countries, including all of out NATO allies,
                    to start looking at this very seriously. I remember the first time I mentioned
                    to the British Committee on Disarmament Ambassador in New York, this was in '93,
                    that we were going to call for the “eventual elimination” of landmines, he said
                    it was a “gimmick.” I said, no, we are serious. Later the UK became one of the
                    strongest backers of the treaty, with a big push from Princess Diana who became
                    a very visible spokesperson for banning landmines.</p>
                <p>But, with the U.S. stepping back from the idea of a treaty, the Canadians took
                    the lead. They called for a conference in Ottawa. The treaty was signed. It
                    gained a great deal of international attention and support. Even though we could
                    not sign it, there were lots of other landmine related activities we could be
                    pushing. The U.S. already was the leading contributor to clearing landmines,
                    with a great deal of money devoted to this. Madeleine and I got involved in a
                    landmine awareness effort, teaming Warner Brothers and DC Comics and the folk
                    singer Judy Collins up with the Pentagon, to produce a mine awareness comic book
                    for children in Bosnia and then Latin America. Superman was used for the first
                    comiSuperman and Wonder Woman for the second, which was a suggestion Madeleine
                    made! All these comics were printed in their own languages to try to warn
                    childreand their parents - about the dangers they were facing from land mines
                    and how to avoid them.</p>
                <p>Q: I was an election observer in Bosnia a couple of times. I remember being
                    lectured once by a lady who said, “You gentlemen, if you have to relieve
                    yourself, don't step off the side of the road. Stay on the pavement.” You could
                    see what it does. You'd see pastureland with tape around it saying not to go on
                    there. It's terrible. Then you'd see people who had amputated limbs.</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Madeleine took a trip to Angola as UN ambassador and she came back
                    telling a story of going out into the countryside and seeing children tethered
                    to trees by their mothers so that they would not wander out in the fields and
                    step on land mines. This became one of her 'talking points' in Washington
                    arguing for more action by the U.S.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>All of this attention led, as I said earlier, to the International Campaign to
                    Ban Landmines receiving the Nobel Prize in 1997. I hope the U.S. will take steps
                    over the next few years to end the use of land mines. The Clinton Administration
                    directed the Pentagon to search for alternatives and be prepared to sign the
                    treaty by 2006. Of course, the U.S., and this is an important point, does not
                    use what are called “dumb land mines,” those that do not self-destruct over a
                    period of time. And if the U.S. does use landmines, anti-personnel and
                    anti-tank, they are mapped and then cleared afterwards. But the fact is that if
                    we're going to see all nations of the world end the use of land mines, the U.S.
                    will have to end its use as well. We can't say, “Well, because we use
                    sophisticated “smart” land mines, those are acceptable, but your dumb ones are
                    not.” That kind of exceptionalism will not work.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find a problem with the Canadians being quite aggressive and in a way
                    sanctimonious about this? They didn't have any troops in the DMZ in Korea. There
                    is a dangerous situation and you have to use every means you can.</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: There was certainly some tension associated with our dealings with
                    Canada over this issue. We would make the point that our international
                    responsibilities and obligations exceeded theirs and other nations, including
                    with respect to South Korea, where 37,000 American troops are standing guard.
                    The Canadians had a very activist foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, who had
                    taken up this cause and very skillfully. He worked with others, including the
                    Norwegians. They basically took the language from the resolutions we had
                    proposed in New York and put them into treaty language and then called on the
                    international community to sign it. At a meeting in Oslo, there were efforts
                    made to see if certain American exceptions could be made to the treaty. The
                    Canadians and others were adamant that there could not be exceptions, that this
                    was a universal treaty and that if the U.S. had its Korean exception, Russia
                    would have its Chechnya exception, and China would have its exceptions, etc. I'm
                    sure Madeleine Albright, who by this time had become Secretary of State, had
                    many conversations with Axworthy on this, and not always ones where they
                    agreed!</p>
                <p>But I will say that I believe the Canadians deserve a great deal of credit for
                    picking up the leadership on this issue when it became clear that the U.S. was
                    not going to be able to reconcile our military and humanitarian imperatives and
                    sign the treaty. This wasn't cost free in a military sense for the Canadians
                    either. As a member of NATO and as an important UN peacekeeping nation, they had
                    to make certain adjustments as well, although certainly not of the magnitude of
                    dealing with the Korean problem as we had. But still, I think that they
                    exercised very important leadership and I commend them for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you work on this? Did you spend a lot of time in
                        thdelegates' lounge?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Absolutely. This was an issue taken up in the UN's First Committee,
                    the Disarmament Committee, so that's where we would introduce our landmine
                    resolutions. The First Committee will convene in the fall, at the start of the
                    General Assembly. Before that I would call a meeting of landmine affected
                    countries like Cambodia, Angola, Bosnia, Ethiopia, Vietnam, El Salvadoabout 30
                    in all. I would meet with their representatives and make sure they knew exactly
                    what we were doing. Their support was especially important since they were the
                    ones that were living with the problem most immediately. Then we would meet with
                    the various UN regional groupings - the Europeans, the Asians, the Latin
                    America. From Washington we would send out cables to our embassies in all
                    capitals from the Secretary of State saying that this resolution would be coming
                    up and that we would hope for that countries support and laying out the
                    arguments in favor of the resolution. This was a full court diplomatic
                    initiative by the U.S.President Clinton, when he came to New York each year at
                    the beginning of the General Assembly, was a key part of this effort. Each year
                    that I was at the U.S. Mission, he had something to say about the scourge of
                    landmines. As I said earlier, he was the first world leader to call for the
                    eventual elimination of anti-personnel land mine. It had not been done before by
                    a world leader. We also met with the NGOs to inform them of our plans and get
                    them involved.</p>
                <p>So we were very successful in raising the visibility of this issue in New York,
                    with plenty of meetings in the delegate's lounge. I do believe that eventually
                    the U.S. will sign the treaty. I was the head of the U.S. delegation that went
                    to Ottawa in 1997 to attend the signing conference. Secretary Albright asked me
                    to take on the job of Special Representative for Global Humanitarian Demining,
                    in addition to my work as Assistant Secretary for South Asia. It was in the
                    former capacity that I was asked to head the delegation to the Ottawa
                    conference. I told the delegates that, while the U.S. could not sign the Ottawa
                    treaty, we felt very much a part of the Ottawa process, which was to move toward
                    the elimination of landmines around the world and that we would keep working on
                    this issue in very practical terms, with demining, assistance to landmine
                    survivors, and landmine awareness efforts. That was appreciated, but there was
                    still a lot of disappointment that the U.S. was not 'on the dotted line.'</p>

                        Hoabout India and Pakistan? How did they deal with the mining problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: They continue to use landmines and they have not signed the treaty,
                    nor did they vote in favor of our resolutions. They abstained. As we have Korea,
                    they have their exception, which is each other and the Kashmir dispute. But,
                    again, we are working on this. The Pentagon is working to find alternatives to
                    landmines and hopefully the new Administration will stick to the 'road map' laid
                    out by the Clinton Administration to be in a position to sign the treaty in
                    2006. Once the U.S. has signed, I believe that will have impact. Just recently,
                    the last remaining NATO members agreed to sign the treaty: Turkey and Greece.
                    Now we're the only NATO country that has not signed. The only other country in
                    the Western Hemisphere that has not signed, in addition to us, is Cuba. It's not
                    very good company.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were at the UN, were there producers
                        of lanmines exporting them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: There were some exporters, but a lot of the production had become
                    home grown. Remember they are cheap and easy to make. Also, a lot of countries
                    don't want to be stigmatized as landmine exporters. So, even if we do not have a
                    universally agreed to treaty, the international norm has been set. Landmines are
                    seen in the same category of weapons as poison gas, something that should be
                    banned by the international community because the consequences of these weapons
                    are far greater on civilians than military personnel. The only way to deal with
                    that is to get rid of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving on... What other elements were you dealing
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Probably the most gratifying and rewarding activity that I undertook
                    had to do with the release of prisoners that had been involved in the conflict
                    in the Western Sahara. Like the land mine issue, I learned about this from some
                    briefing materials I read prior to going on a Security Council mission to
                    Morocco in 1995. During the time I was in New York, the Security Council
                    authorized several fact finding missions. Because I was dealing with
                    peacekeeping and I was our deputy representative in the Security Council, and
                    because it was difficult for Ambassador Albright to take the time to be away
                    from New York and Washington for long stretches, I was the one asked to
                    represent the U.S. We had Council missions to Mozambique, Burundi, Somalia,
                    Angola, Rwanda, and the Western Sahara. That trip to the Western Sahara turned
                    out to be one of the most meaningful for me. In our briefing papers for the trip
                    there was a reference to a group of prisoners from the fighting that took place
                    in the mid-'70s between Morocco and the Polisario, the group that wanted to
                    establish an independent state in the Western Sahara. Twenty five years later
                    they were still there, getting older and many of them in poor health. The
                    briefing papers referred to a specific group of prisoners being held in the
                    desert at a place called Camp Serfaty, about 200 old Moroccan prisoners. The
                    International Committee of the Red Cross had been allowed to visit them and
                    appeals had been made to both parties to allow them to go. The Polisario had
                    agreed. But the Moroccans would not accept their own prisoners back because, by
                    doing so, it would suggest that they were recognizing the Polisario.
                    Diplomatically I guess you can sort of see their point, but what you were really
                    talking about were a bunch old soldiers wasting away in the desert. It was
                    clearly a humanitarian issue. The UN asked the Council mission if, during its
                    talks with both parties, we could make some references to this situation.</p>
                <p>We went to Rabat first. I told the Argentine ambassador, Emilio Cardenas, that I
                    intended to raise this issue. He agreed. Of course our main purpose there was to
                    try to get the UN referendum back on track so that the two sides could settle
                    their long-standing dispute once and for all, peacefully.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>So we raised the issue of prisoners in our talks with Moroccan officials in
                    Rabat. We did not get any firm response, one way or the other. Then we went to
                    see the Polisario at their headquarters inside Algeria near Tindouf, way out
                    there in the desert. We stayed overnight. As things transpired, dinner was about
                    2:00 am. I spoke to one Polisario official during the dinner and raised this
                    prisoner issue. I asked, “Where is Camp Serfaty?” He said, “Oh, it's about an
                    hour away from here.” I said, “Can I go there?” He said, “You want to go there?”
                    I said, “Yes.” He said, “We'll see.” I mentioned this to Ambassador Cardenas. He
                    said, “I'll go.” He is a man of great enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>The next morning, they had a jeep waiting for Emilio and me and took us to see
                    the prisoners. It was a unbelievable. I couldn't believe that we were actually
                    there. They were in this sort of camp enclosure, in huts. Where could they go?
                    They were in the middle of the desert. They raised chickens. As we walked from
                    hut to hut, some of the prisoners started writing things down. They asked if we
                    would take letters back and give them to the ICRC to get to their families. Of
                    course we said yes.</p>
                <p>When Emilio and I got back to New York we starting thinking about what we could
                    do about “those guys,” as Emilio called them. So we started meeting with the
                    Polisario representative in New York and the Moroccan ambassador, separately. We
                    got the representative of the ICRC, Peter Kung, involved. Over a period of
                    several weeks, we were able to gain agreement from the Moroccans to allow us to
                    bring their prisoners home, but only, according to Moroccan government, if the
                    U.S. and Argentinand especially the U.S. would do it. That meant getting some
                    help with airlift.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Albright spoke to our JSC contact in Washington and asked, “Can we get
                    some C-130s [medium transport planes] out of Europe to come in and help move
                    these people out of the desert?” Cardenas spoke to his government and they got a
                    plane to fly from Buenos Aires. Suffice is to say that in December of '95, we
                    rendezvoused in Tindouf, just after sunrise. I came in on a C-130 that the Air
                    Force had flown from Germany They picked me up at a base near Marrakesh.
                    Cardenas came in from Buenos Aires on his government's 707. Pursuant to our
                    agreement, the ICRC had gone to the camp before we arrived to help with the
                    repatriation, and brought the prisoners to the airfield in Tindouf where we were
                    waiting with the planes. They boarded and we were off to a camp the Moroccans
                    had set up for their arrival, with a lot of medical personnel standing by to
                    examine and help the old soldiers. In the end, the Moroccans had done the right
                    thing. The men were then reunited with the families some time later.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>Now we had agreed to do this whole operation in confidence; other than
                    acknowledging the mission had taken place we were not going to comment. The
                    Moroccans did not want any press. This was politically sensitive for them. A
                    small item appeared, I think in Reuters. I never spoke to any reporter about
                    this. But the New York Times got the story and its reporter contacted Emilio. He
                    figured the cat was already out of the bag, so he spoke. The next day the story
                    appeared in the Times - “Two Diplomats Rescue 185 Imprisoned In Sahara.” It
                    started, and this is a quote, by saying that “two swashbuckling ambassadors
                    commanding two military transport planes swooped down on an airstrip just over
                    the border from Algeria, cut through some red tape, and took the old soldiers
                    home.” A little literary license there. But the fact is that this whole
                    experience was enormously meaningful to uwe actually got to see the results of
                    our diplomatic effort, in human terms. Knowing that these prisoners were
                    returned and that they could be reunited with their families was one of the most
                    important things I've ever been able to work on.</p>
                <p>I should also mention that this mission was followed by another one a few months
                    later. This time I worked with a German member of the Security Council,
                    Ambassador Henze. Argentina had rotated off the Council in January so Emilio was
                    no longer available for this.</p>
                <p>Once again we joined up with the Moroccans, the Polisario and the ICRthis time to
                    work out an agreement to allow the return home of 66 Polisario prisoners held by
                    the Moroccans. At one point the King of Morocco wrote President Clinton saying
                    that he had agreed to do this because this was obviously so important to the
                    U.S.! This time we needed only one plane so Gerhard Henze was able to provide a
                    German commercial charter. We flew them from Agadir in Morocco back to Tindouf
                    and then we took buses and jeeps into the desert for a reunion with families.
                    Guns were fired in the air...people were crying and singing. Absolutely amazing.
                    So we were able to see a two-way exchange. Unfortunately, there are 1,500
                    Moroccan prisoners still out there. Time ran out for me to continue working with
                    the Moroccans and the Polisario to let all these people go home. But it was an
                    experience I will never forget.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run across the problem that seems to permeate
                        anything wdo and that is with Israel? Did that impact on your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Not directly. In the Security Council, Ambassador Albright was the
                    leader of our delegation. We had two deputy representatives in the Council, who
                    would sit in the chair when she was not there. I was one. The other was
                    initially Ambassador Ned Walker, and then he was replaced by Ambassador Skip
                    Gnehm, both of whom are career FSOs with a lot of experience in the Middle East.
                    Skip had been our ambassador to Kuwait during the Gulf War experience; Ned had
                    been our ambassador to the UAE and would later serve as chief of mission in both
                    Egypt and Israel. So they handled the Mideast issues in the Council when
                    Madeleine was not there. I did not. I had my hands full elsewhere. I wished them
                    the best of luck!</p>

                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: They did Iraq as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had enough. Let's go to Bosnia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Madeleine Albright did Bosnia, which was a major preoccupation from
                    the day she arrived to the day she left to become Secretary of State. She was in
                    the U.S. chair in the Security Council for this almost without exception. She
                    was really our desk officer at the U.S. Mission for Bosnia, although we did have
                    a great desk officer by the name of Stuart Seldowitz, a young foreign service
                    officer. He worked on all the Security Council resolutions dealing with Bosnia
                    and the former Yugoslavia. There were about 100 during our stay there, an
                    enormous number. But when Bosnia came up, whether it be in the Security Council
                    or with the P5 or with the Secretary General, Madeleine handled it. This was a
                    major focus of hers, not only in New York but also in Washington in the NSC and
                    with the President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were part of the team.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Yes, but this was probably the biggest foreign policy issue from the
                    standpoint of the U.S. government in the UN. For U.S. foreign policy, our
                    relations with Russia, with China, and with the Middle East, those issues were
                    Washington-dominant and largely bilateral in nature. But Bosnia was the
                    multilateral issue of highest importance, hence Albright's focus on that in New
                    York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Genocide.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: That's right. I believe Madeleine, with her very strong personal and
                    academic background in European affairs and Central Europe, understood the
                    implications of what was happening in Bosnia better than many others. She wanted
                    to see the U.S. exert influence in whatever would be the best to put that war
                    out. When we first got to New York in '93, the peace plan of the moment was the
                    Vance-Owen Plan. It never got off the ground, in part because the U.S. did not
                    see it as workable. There were a great number of UN resolutions condemning what
                    was happening in Bosnia. There was a UN peacekeeping presence there, known as
                    UNPROFOR, that was not keeping peace and was barely a presence. The fighting
                    continued and the horror stories of ethnic cleansing, of genocide, continued.
                    Madeleine Albright saw earlier than most of her colleagues that at some point
                    the threat of force would be required to back down Milosevic and those Bosnian
                    Serb leaders that were intent on imposing their bloody will throughout the
                    region. She took this on as a primary responsibility for herself at the UN and
                    later as Secretary of State. I think to her great credit, that war was put out
                    and today Milosevic is in jail, at the Hague, and standing before the
                    International War Crimes Tribunal. Without a doubt, Madeleine Albright had as
                    much to do as anyone to put him there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were all of you enlisted in this effort in trying to do
                        somethinabout Bosnia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: We all had parts that we would play. There would be so many meetings
                    Ambassador Albright could not attend them alinformal Security Council meetings,
                    P5 and Contact Group meetings. Certainly when she was traveling we filled in on
                    this issue.She took several trips to Bosnia and the region during this time. But
                    the focus of her attention was on Washington and getting the principals of the
                    NSC to at least be open to the possibility of greater and more direct U.S.
                    involvement, including military involvement if that were necessary.</p>
                <p>Q: There was a considerable amount of bluster... I've interviewed our former
                    ambassador to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmerman, and made that point that air strikes
                    could have probably taken care of particularly some of the Serb aggression.</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Warren Zimmerman has written on this subject and knows it far better
                    than I. But it is absolutely true that air strikes played an important role once
                    they were used. And the threat of military force was an important factor and was
                    used to great advantage by Richard Holbrooke, who was then the Assistant
                    Secretary of State. He had the task of organizing the Dayton Conference. Dick is
                    very determined, experienced, hard headed, and a tough negotiator. He spent a
                    lot of time in that region trying to find a path toward a settlement. On one of
                    those occasions his small party was traveling just outside Sarajevo when one of
                    the armored personnel carriers carrying several members of the U.S. team went
                    off the side of the road down a mountain. Three Americans died, one of whom I
                    knew, Joe Kruzel, a contemporary of mine who was working at the Defense
                    Department. It was very sad, a real tragedy.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>In the end, Holbrooke was successful at Dayton. An agreement was reached and he
                    played a very important role. But I also think Madeleine Albright had laid the
                    groundwork for giving this issue greater attention and moving the President in
                    the direction that he eventually took. I think she also had an ally in the
                    National Security Adviser, Tony Lake, but this is a story that I imagine she is
                    going to tell at much greater length than I can and with far greater authority
                    and insight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the relationship of Madeleine Albright
                        anBoutros-Ghali, the UN Secretary General?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: That has received a great deal of attention since she was the one
                    that cast the veto on the Security Council to deny him a second term. It was a
                    lonely veto. We were the only negative vote. She had a cordial, correct
                    relationship with the SYG [Secretary General]. This was not something personal.
                    In fact, I know she was offended by some of the derogatory statements and
                    offensive remarks made by some U.S. politicians about Boutros-Ghali, that these
                    were uncalled for and unbecoming for the U.S. Many Republican leaders said that
                    he was “running U.S. foreign policy,” that the Clinton Administration had put
                    him in charge. Well, those statements were clearly political. But then there
                    were the constant references to his full namBoutros Boutros-Ghalsaid in almost a
                    sneering fashion, putting down his 'foreign-ness.' I think Madeleine felt that
                    crossed the line.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>At the same time, she hathe Administration haa number of concerns about his
                    performance as Secretary General. He had not taken up the cause of UN reform. He
                    ran the UN more as a personal fiefdom than as a hands-on manager. Ambassador
                    Albright recognized that the UN risked losing the U.S. if reform steps were not
                    taken; she knew in her dealings with Capitol Hill that there was a growing
                    opposition to the UN because of all of these reports of waste, fraud, and abuse,
                    and that we would never pay our dues on time or pay back our arrears as long as
                    these things were not addressed in a serious, systematic fashion. Boutros did
                    not appear the man for that job. U.S.- UN relations were becoming increasingly
                    strained, for this and other reasons including his handling of Bosnia and the
                    so-called “dual-key” controversy. So, the decision was taken that we would not
                    support him for re-election. Many countries quietly agreed but they basically
                    let us cast the veto and take the heat for doing what had not been done before,
                    which was to deny an incumbent Secretary General a second term. He was
                    representing the continent of Africa and there is an informal agreement about
                    regions having two terms, then rotating. Our veto was of Boutros-Ghali, not
                    Boutros-Ghali the African candidate. So we made it clear very early that we
                    would be willing to consider another African candidate for that second term.
                    Fortunately there already was one person from Africa that many believed could
                    step into that position, a person that knew the UN very well, and that had a
                    great deal of respect - and that was Kofi Annan of Ghana. So, after the veto of
                    Boutros-Ghali, the African countries said, “We do want to continue to the
                    practice of two terms” for each region. We said, “We can support that.” Very
                    quickly, it became clear that Kofi Annan would be the consensus choice for
                    Secretary General, and he has done a great job, including on the reform
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved with Jesse Helms at the election of
                        '94 wheCongress reverted back to the Republicans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I did not. Ambassador Albright appeared before his Committee, and
                    later made a big effort to develop good relations with Chairman Helms when she
                    became Secretary of State. She even gave him a t-shirt that said “Somebody at
                    the State Department Loves Me.” I appeared before some committees while I was at
                    the UN - usually about peacekeeping activities - including Armed Services and
                    Intelligence - but never appeared before Senator Helms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other issues that we should cover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: There are two other things that I would like to mention. Both took
                    place after Madeleine had moved on to Washington to prepare for her new position
                    as Secretary of State and Bill Richardson had come to New York to assume her job
                    as the U.S. Permanent Representative. I had known Bill for some years, so I was
                    very pleased that he had been selected by the President and had agreed to give
                    up his seat in Congress to take that job.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>As I was winding up my own activities in New York, I started thinking about the
                    increasing number of people that were dying in UN peacekeeping operationnot just
                    peacekeepers but other UN personnel that were involved. A helicopter had
                    recently crashed killing a number of peacekeepers. I asked one of the people in
                    the peacekeeping department, “What is the procedure for those who have died? How
                    are the families notified? Do they receive a medal? Do they receive any kind of
                    commendation?” I was told they got a letter of notification and some financial
                    compensation for the family. But there was nothing to really express the
                    appreciation of the UN and the international community for their loss. So, in
                    the final days I was there, and working with my military colleagues at the U.S.
                    Mission, we worked on a resolution to establish a medal for those who had given
                    their lives for UN peacekeeping. Washington agreed with the proposal. The
                    resolution was introduced in the Security Council and was adopted by all 15
                    members with the strong support of Kofi Annan. It was named the Dag Hammarskjold
                    Medal for the UN Secretary General who died on a peacekeeping mission in the
                    Congo many years before. The person that designed the medal itself was someone
                    my wife Merrie and I have known for many years, Louis Nelson, who is the husband
                    of singer Judy Collins. Judy is very involved with the land mine issue. Both are
                    very committed to working with the UN.</p>
                <p>The other thing I wanted to mention had to do with the farewell dinners you
                    usually have when you are leaving the UN after an assignment. Bill Richardson
                    said that he wanted to have such an event for me and Skip Gnehm since we were
                    both leaving to take new positions in Washington with Secretary Albright. I was
                    asked if I would like to have a lunch or a dinner. I said, “Why don't we do
                    something different? Let's have hot dogs and beer.” The person handling this for
                    Ambassador Richardson said, “What do you mean by that?” I said, “Why don't we
                    take the Security Council to Yankee Stadium? That would be the event!” Well,
                    Bill Richardson had played semi-pro baseball so he thought it was a great idea.
                    It turns out that the Yankees were playing the New York Mets in an intra-league
                    seriea real crosstown rivalry. The members of the Security Council were excited.
                    We arranged for two small buses to take us out to the game from the UN. We
                    offered each of the ambassadors either a Yankees or Mets cap as they boarded the
                    bus. I knew we were in trouble when the Egyptian ambassador got on the bus and
                    said he wanted a Redskins [a football team] hat. But some of the ambassadors
                    were very attuned to baseball including the Japanese ambassador, Ambassador
                    Owada, who knows baseball better than most of the Americans because of Japan's
                    great love of the game. It was a wonderful occasion. The Russian ambassador,
                    Sergei Lavrov, got into the game; so did the British Ambassador, Sir John
                    Weston. It went into extra innings. Not one of the 57,000 Yankees and Mets fans
                    left. At the very end, I never thought I would see the very formal and dignified
                    Japanese ambassador giving a high five to the Kenyan ambassador when the Yankees
                    won! Since I am a lifelong Yankees fan - my father took me to the '57 World
                    Series to see the Yankees and Braves play - I was still looking for Mickey
                    Mantle, who was not playing that day. Still, it was a great experience. I also
                    think that it was a diplomatic success!</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>New York was such a rewarding experience for me and I was especially pleased that
                    my friend and boss, Madeleine Albright, had now been chosen by the President to
                    take over the State Department. She was ready for the job because of her UN
                    experience. I think President Clinton's decision to appoint her was the right
                    one for so many reasons, including a personal one for me. As a father of three
                    daughters, I understood the great importance of seeing a woman finally ascend to
                    the highest appointive position in the U.S. government, a position first held by
                    Thomas Jefferson. I was delighted to see Madeleine Albright achieve that honor.
                    She has broken through many barriers in her life, but this was the most
                    important.</p>

                <p>INDERFURTH: The swearing in was in August of 1997. I had come down from New York
                    just a little before that to prepare for the confirmation hearing. I served from

                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is June 22, 2001. How did the offer and all come about?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Well, having worked very closely with Madeleine the previous four
                    years at the UN, it was my hope and indeed expectation that she would ask me to
                    join her in some capacity in Washington. The question was in what capacity. Once
                    she was nominated, she left the mission in New York and was totally involved in
                    her transition to become Secretary of State. Her chief of staff, Elaine Shocus,
                    and I stayed in touch. Elaine let me know early on that they would want me to
                    come work at the Department. After four years of commuting between Washington
                    and New York, I was ready to return home with my family!</p>
                <p>Several weeks after Madeleine was nominated, I received a call from Strobe
                    Talbott, the Deputy Secretary, who was working with her in Washington to put her
                    new team together. Strobe said he would be in New York and could I see him at
                    the Waldorf, where he was staying. Strobe and I have known each other for many
                    years, going back to when he was a correspondent for Time magazine, and major
                    columnist, and I was at ABC. We had a strong mutual interest in arms control
                    issues. Strobe came into government because of his very close connection to
                    President Clintothey were Rhodes Scholars together in Englanand the President
                    wanted him to handle the Russia account, which was Strobe's major interest and
                    specialty. After about a year, Secretary Christopher asked him to be Deputy
                    Secretary of State and Madeleine asked him to continue in this capacity once she
                    got the job.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Strobe said that he and Madeleine had been talking about what might be possible
                    and where my background and skills would best fit. He suggested that I give
                    serious consideration to the South Asia Bureau. That came as something of a
                    surprise. I am not a South Asian specialist by training and had traveled there
                    only twicthe first time with President Carter on his 1978 trip to India. I was
                    then working on the NSC staff as Zbigniew Brzezinski's special assistant. The
                    second time was when I was working for ABC in Moscow as a correspondent. In 1990
                    I flew to Kabul on a Soviet cargo transport plane to cover the latest coup
                    attempt against the then Afghan leader Najibullah. Of course, over the previous
                    four years I had worked in New York at the UN with various South Asian
                    delegations, especially the Pakistani delegation because they had served on the
                    Security Council when I first arrived and then the Indian delegation because
                    they are omnipresent in New York, a major player. I mentioned all this to Strobe
                    and he said: “Well, we're not looking for a South Asian expert. We're looking
                    for someone that 1) has the trust and confidence of the new Secretary of State,
                    2) knows the policymaking process and how Washington works, and 3) has
                    demonstrated an ability to learn a new portfolio quickly, as you did when you
                    came to the UN. Madeleine wants you to give this serious consideration and
                    she'll be in touch.” Strobe also said there might be other positions for me to
                    consider. As it turned out, two other possibilities were explored: to be the
                    Press Spokesman for the Secretary (because of my experience with ABC). Madeleine
                    and I occasionally discussed this in the past and I had always said I would
                    rather not be doing the press full time, that I really liked the substantive
                    assignments I had. The other possibility was Assistant Secretary for
                    Intelligence and Research [INR], which would have drawn on my earlier experience
                    on the Senate Intelligence Committee and as a 'consumer' of the intelligence
                    product in government - at the NSC, on the Hill and more recently at the UN.</p>
                <p>I decided to ask for some advice from Skip Gnehm, who was at that point still in
                    New York as our Deputy Permanent Representative (the number two job) and a good
                    friend and a career Foreign Service officer. I said to Skip, “Strobe has
                    suggested South Asia.” Skip said, “Take it.” I said, “Why?” He said, “The best
                    job in the Foreign Service is to be a regional assistant secretary of State. You
                    have a region. You're responsible for it. You're working directly with the
                    Secretary and the 7th Floor. You're going to be involved with the NSC and the
                    White House. It's the best job.” I then had a good discussion with the new
                    Secretary of State-designate. Shortly thereafter Strobe called me at home and
                    asked, “Have you decided?” I said, “South Asia.” He said, “Great.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The South Asia Bureau is quite new. How did it peel off
                        from thNear Eastern Bureau and why? What was the composition of the
                        Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Once I thanked Madeleine and Strobe, I should have picked up the
                    phone to call Senator Moynihan and former Congressman Steve Solarz to thank
                    them. They were the two in Congress that pushed through legislation requiring
                    the State Department to establish the South Asia Bureau, over the Department's
                    objections, in 1992. The Executive Branch does not like to be told how to
                    organize itself by Congress, so, on principle, there was an objection. But
                    Congress in its wisdoand this was a wise thing to do! determined that South
                    Asia, as part the Bureau for Near East and South Asian Affairs, was simply not
                    getting the attention it needethat it could never compete with Middle East
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And on the Israeli situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: That's right. The way it worked in the past was a Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary would be handed the South Asia portfolio, with the Assistant Secretary
                    only becoming occasionally involved, mainly during a crisis. Solarz and
                    Moynihan, and he was a former U.S. ambassador to New Delhi, both felt that South
                    Asia and especially India was getting shortchanged, that U.S.-Indian relations
                    had never achieved the potential that our two democracies should naturally have,
                    for a closer, stronger relationship. One reason for this was that the
                    relationship wasn't constantly on the radar screen in Washington at senior
                    levels. So, they legislated the establishment of a separate South Asia Bureau.
                    This was at the beginning of the Clinton Administration. Robin Raphel, who was
                    the political counselor in New Delhi, was chosen to be the first Assistant
                    Secretary.</p>
                <p>So, that was the genesis of the Bureau. Clearly the region has gotten more
                    attention. At times it has even been a central focus within the Executive
                    Branch, which we'll discuss as part of this interview. And particularly in the
                    last year, the year 2000, there was a significant breakthrough in relations with
                    India and, hopefully, putting all of South Asia more on the map. Tom Pickering,
                    who I was so fortunate to work with when he was Under Secretary of State and who
                    is a former ambassador to India, said in '97 that South Asia has been on the
                    “backside of every U.S. diplomatic globe” for far too long and he hoped to see
                    that change during President Clinton's second term. I believe that happened, as
                    we'll discuss.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we move to the substance of what you were doing, could you talk a bit
                    about the staffing of the Bureau? Had there developed a cadre of South Asian
                    experts?</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Since South Asia had not gotten a lot of U.S. attention over the
                    years, except during times of crisis, it really hadn't attracted as much foreign
                    service interest as some other regions. It certainly didn't have the pull of
                    U.S.-Soviet relations, or East-West relations, that had developed a cadre of
                    experts like Kennan and Bohlen and Thompson over the years. Nor had it
                    approached the status of having Middle East 'hands' or China 'hands.' But there
                    is no doubt that I inherited a group of people that had served in the region,
                    that knew it and cared about it - FSOs like Al Eastham, Bob Boggs, John Holzman,
                    Don Camp, young officers like Brad Hanson and Joe Novak, Mike Malinowski, who is
                    soon to be our ambassador to Nepal; Bill Milam, now serving as our ambassador
                    iPakistan (who also served as ambassador to Bangladesh earlier). Most recently
                    Bill had been in Liberia, which seems to be part of the career pattern for South
                    Asia specialists at State. Many young FSOs get some experience in the region,
                    move up in the ranks, and often get a higher posting, including their first
                    ambassadorial post, in Africa. There are a lot more countries there to place
                    peopl50 or so compared to the eight in South Asia. An example is Nancy Powell,
                    who has great experience South Asia, then when off to be our ambassador in
                    Uganda. I kept trying to get back, including into the ambassador's post in
                    Pakistan, as I was leaving the department.</p>
                <p>But the fact is that South Asia is a region that is extraordinarily diverse and
                    fascinating in terms of people, culture, geography, history, religion. That's
                    why there are some really good career officers who have found this a
                    particularly interesting place to spent much of their careers. I had the good
                    fortune of having a number of them work for me while I was head of the South
                    Asia Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which countries are there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka,
                    and Maldives. We don't have direct diplomatic relations with Maldives, the
                    island nation in the Indian Ocean. We are accredited there through Sri Lanka.
                    Afghanistan is a country that we do not have a diplomatic presence in because of
                    the continuing civil war. Bhutan is another country we do not have formal
                    diplomatic relations with, but we do work with them through their mission in New
                    York at the UN. In fact, my last visit as Assistant Secretary to the region
                    included a stop in Thimpu, Bhutan's capital, to work on a refugee issue with the
                    King. What a beautiful country, which the King is just beginning to open up to
                    the world, but very slowly.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>So, the South Asia region has the smallest number of countries of any of the
                    other regional bureaus, which also means we are the smallest in terms of
                    personnel. We only had 30-40 people in the bureau in Washington. But that
                    allowed us to do something the bigger bureaus could not - really get to know
                    those that you're working with, avoid too much compartmentalization. It also
                    meant there could be much more contact from the desk officer with the Assistant
                    Secretary. That's an advantage. It helps morale. I do think that over time the
                    Bureau should expand. I think one expansion makes more sense than others, which
                    is to incorporate Central Asia, have the Bureau of South Asia and Central Asian
                    Affairs as opposed to the Central Asian former Soviet republics being associated
                    with the European Bureau, which is where they are now.</p>

                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: It does.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there you're talking about one of the great turf
                        battles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Yes. There are great turf battles. I was very happwith my turf. It
                    proved to be just a fascinating assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find yourself received by the professional
                        corps oForeign Service in your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: As a political appointee, as a non-careerist, there were probably a
                    few questions about why Ambassador Inderfurth from the U.S. Mission to New York
                    was being given the South Asia job. In terms of presenting myself to my new
                    colleagues, I wanted to play to my strength. The strength that I had above all
                    others was my close association with the new Secretary of State. That would be
                    very useful in getting our South Asia business to her on the 7th floor and past
                    the gatekeepers if necessary. I also called attention to my recent diplomatic
                    experience with India and Pakistan at the Uand the contacts I had made. My
                    experience on Capitol Hill and at the NSC was a big pluknowing how the Congress
                    and the White House works from the inside. Also my work on nuclear arms control
                    and disarmament issues was useful, given that the U.S. government continued to
                    have big concerns about both India and Pakistan and their nuclear and missile
                    programs. Then there was my press background, which turned out to be enormously
                    valuable in dealing with the South Asian press corpand the Washington reporters
                    covering the State Department. I made it clear that I saw dealing with the press
                    as an opportunity, not as a threat or something to be avoided, and that I would
                    want to be proactive with the press, to get information to them so that they
                    could better understand what we were trying to accomplish in terms of our South
                    Asia policy. So I would have meetings with the South Asian reporters fairly
                    frequently, and be as responsive as I could by phone when they needed to speak
                    with me. I think all this was a big plus for what we were trying to do in
                    raising the visibility of the region and interest level.</p>
                <p>Now, going back to my reception by the professional corps, as you put it. Career
                    Foreign Service officers are diplomats, so they were very diplomatic about not
                    calling attention to my lack of South Asia credentials. They wanted to see how I
                    would perform. I'm sure they had their fingers crossed. I also got some very
                    good advice from Skip Gnehm, whom Madeleine had asked to take on the job of
                    Director General for the department. Skip not only gave me good advice about
                    taking the South Asia position, but also how, as assistant secretary, I would
                    need to pay attention to, and help in any way I could, advance the careers of
                    those working in the bureau from the most junior officer to those who were
                    reaching a point in their career when they could be considered for an
                    ambassadorial post. I tried to do that. I was very pleased while I was there
                    that one of our senior officers, Steve Mann, received an ambassadorial
                    assignment to Turkmenistan and Mike Malinowski was tapped for Nepal. Both did
                    great work for me in the South Asia Bureau and I was very pleased to put their
                    names forward for these jobs.</p>
                <p>One final point. I think political appointees do bring certain attributes to
                    their positions that careerists sometimes do not, including a close relationship
                    with the incoming Secretary of State. Appointees will clearly be very attentive
                    to the direction and objectives that the Secretary and the administration want
                    to pursue. But the best combinatiowhen the department works at its best -is when
                    the political appointee works closely with the career foreign service officers
                    and draws on their background and expertise to make policy that will work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived, what were you hit with? What was the
                        issue iAugust '97?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I'm glad you asked. August was my swearing in, but I had my
                    confirmation hearing several weeks before that. In May of that year, something
                    important had occurred which I called attention to during my confirmation
                    hearing. Prime Minister Inder K. Gujral of India, someone that I came to admire
                    and today consider a friend, had met with the Pakistani Prime Minister, Nawaz
                    Sharif, who had recently been elected for the second time to that office. They
                    met at a SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] summit in the
                    Maldives, in Mail. They met, had a handshake and a photograph together, and they
                    said it was very important to move beyond the tragic past of the two countries.
                    India and Pakistan had already had three wars. It was a very hopeful sign. In
                    The Washington Post, there was an editorial that appeared just as I was going up
                    for my confirmation hearings entitled “South Asian Ripple.” The first line of
                    that editorial said, “A little ripple of promise of better relations between
                    India and Pakistan has spread across South Asia.” It focused on the meeting
                    between Sharif and Gujral. When I appeared for my confirmation hearing I wanted
                    to say something like, “I would like to see that little ripple of promise become
                    a tidal wave of hope.” I didn't say that, but I certainly was encouraging and
                    upbeat. I also tried during my tenure as Assistant Secretary not to allow
                    events, no matter how discouraging, to keep me from sounding some positive note,
                    to hang onto something that would move us in a more positive direction.</p>
                <p>Q: The Clinton administration had been in for four years. Had they developed an
                    approach to India and Pakistan? In four years, an administration kind of begins
                    to feel comfortable with their approach. Or had they?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I think the answer is, they had not. The first four years, President
                    Clinton was focused on other areas. First, as we know from the '92 campaign, it
                    was the economy and domestic affairs. Then he started getting more involved in
                    international foreign affairs. Bosnia placed itself up at the top of that list.
                    And relations with Russia. South Asia was not near the top of his list. It
                    remained, to a large degree, on the “backside of the diplomatic globe.” There
                    was an attempt in Clinton's first four years to try to rationalize our policy
                    towards Pakistan and to deal with the so-called Pressler sanctions which had
                    been imposed on Pakistan in 1990 because Pakistan had acquired a nuclear
                    capability. My predecessor, Robin Raphel, worked hard on this. A Congressional
                    amendment, the Brown amendment, did allow some of the restrictions on Pakistan
                    to be loosened.</p>
                <p>An important event happened in 1995. The First Lady, Hillary Clinton, went to
                    South Asia. She traveled to India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka.
                    Her daughter, Chelsea, was with her. She was clearly impressed by the region,
                    and what she had seen and heard. She came back from that trip and, from what I
                    later heard, let the President know that this was a part of the world he ought
                    to pay more attention to, that it was an area of the world with great promise,
                    economic potential, and increasingly democratic.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>When I arrived in '97, a National Security Council review of our policy towards
                    South Asia was underway. It resulted in a directive approved by the President to
                    establish a policy of “greater engagement” with South Asia. There were several
                    'baskets' of issues that would be pursueeconomic, political, military - but the
                    main point was that the U.S. would be more involved with the region and that
                    would include high level visits by U.S. officials, including the President,
                    something that had not happened for a very long time. I came in just as this
                    policy was in its final stages and being agreed to. I would be, as the regional
                    assistant secretary, the beneficiary of this.</p>
                <p>One other thing, about high level visits. President Clinton wanted to go to India
                    and Pakistan for their 50th anniversary of independence, which took place in
                    1947. The last presidential visit to the region had been Jimmy Carter's in 1978,
                    to India. I knew because I was on that trip, probably the only person in the
                    Clinton administration that had been. The last visit of a secretary of state was
                    George Shultz in 1983. This was a neglected region! A new team had come in. We
                    were given our marching orders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Madeleine Albright, how did she deal with you and
                        what washe telling you she wanted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: We had developed a very good working relationship in New York - one
                    that was based on a high degree of confidence that she had in me to do my job.
                    We did not need to communicate on a daily basis to ensure that was being done.
                    We continued to work on this basis once she took up 'residence' on the 7th floor
                    at State.</p>
                <p>One of our first talks was the need to pursue this policy of “greater engagement”
                    with South Asia. Madeleine said that she was prepared to travel to the region as
                    soon as I thought it was appropriate and needed. I started thinking about at the
                    end of 1997. Remember we had hoped the President would be going there for the
                    50th Independence Day celebrations in August, but the Indian government fell, so
                    the President decided to hold off until a new government was formed. This wasn't
                    the last time his intention to travel there was interrupted by events, including
                    the nuclear tests in May of 1998 and, later, another Indian national election.
                    You'll see a pattern here. He kept wanting to go, but some event or another
                    prevented that. He finally made it to the region in March 2000.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>I took my first trip there as assistant secretary in September of '97. It was
                    meant to send a signal to the regioand especially the Indian governmenthat we
                    were going to be a lot more active in President Clinton's second term. The
                    President wanted this, so did the new Secretary of State and her team which
                    included Tom Pickering as Under Secretary and me. That message came through. Of
                    all the headlines during my many trips to the region, the one I am most pleased
                    with was one in “The Hindu,” one of India's major national newspapers. The front
                    page article had the headline “Inderfurth projects new approach to South Asia,”
                    and showed a smiling photograph of me and Foreign Secretary Raghunath emerging
                    from our first meeting at South Block. The article reported that some of my
                    “utterances” during our exchange had included “A new basis” for U.S.-Indian
                    relations, “looking into the future” and “sustained interaction.” There were
                    other similar headlines, including one that said, “New U.S. official leaves
                    positive image in Delhi.”</p>
                <p>Basically my message on that first trip to New Delhi was, “Look, we realize that
                    our two countries have not had the best of relations over the years. We have
                    beeas Dennis Kux has said in his excellent book on the history of U.S.-India
                    relation'Estranged Democracies.' President Clinton is determined to put our
                    relations on a sounder footing. The world is changing. So should our relations.”
                    That message was well received. Over the next two and a half years, we had a
                    number of problems to deal witincluding the nuclear tests and the imposition of
                    sanctionbut I think we were able to hang onto that basis message - that we were
                    serious about trying to establish a new relationship, one that would be
                    sustainable, that would be in both of our interests, and one that would be
                    characterized by mutual respect rather than the lecturing and moralizing that
                    had unfortunately been the nature of our relationship for a very long time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: We are. It was important to try to start listening to each other as
                    opposed to simply speaking at each other. I think we did that. Indeed I tried to
                    be more respectful in all my meetings in South Asia, not just with the
                    Indians.After I finished my meetings in Delhi, I went to Pakistan and met with
                    Prime MinisteSharif, who was just returning to office. I told him I was
                    encouraged about the meeting that he had recently had with his Indian
                    counterpart, Prime Minister Gujral. Wmainly he - also spoke about the need to
                    resolve a longstanding irritant in U.S.-Pakistani relations relating to F-16
                    fighter planes. The Pakistani government had purchased about 30 of these for
                    around $500 million just at the time the U.S. imposed nuclear-related sanctions
                    on Pakistathe so-called Pressler amendmenin 1990. So, by law, we could not
                    deliver the F-16s to Pakistan. Nor did we return their money, since we had
                    already sent it on to the aircraft manufacturer. Rightly, the Pakistanis were a
                    little upset about this!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've never understood this. This has happened a number of
                        times.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: It is because it's a legal requirement that once you have imposed
                    sanctions, nothing is then delivered or returned to the country you have imposed
                    sanctions on. But this was in 1990 and they were not happy about this. They were
                    out their planes and almost half a billion dollars. President Clinton, much to
                    his credit, said in his very first meeting with Sharif's predecessor, Benazir
                    Bhutto, that “This isn't fair.” We were able to get it resolved before we left
                    office.</p>
                <p>After Pakistan on that first trip I went to Bangladesh, another country in the
                    region that we wanted to try to build our relations. It is certainly not the
                    “international basket case” that Henry Kissinger said it was in 1971, and for
                    which they have never forgiven him!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a term that comes up in the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: But it's no “basket case,” even though it has lots of problems.
                    Bangladesh is now a country that is struggling to establish its democracy. But
                    it has also found that it has economic resources, including natural gas, which
                    has the potential for bringing Bangladesh into the middle income nations. It is
                    also a country that has a very commendable record on family planning. It's
                    dealing with issues such as child labor in ways that others in the region are
                    not. So, we determined early on that Bangladesh would be a country that we would
                    try to include and highlight in our new policy of engagement policy toward the
                    region. When the President traveled to South Asia in March of 2000, we included
                    a brief visit to Dacca. It was the first ever visit by an American president
                    there. But that first trip for me in September, '97, which also included Nepal
                    and Sri Lanka, just underscored the fact that this was going to be a great
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>Upon getting back, I met with Secretary Albright, reported on the trip, and said,
                    “Now it's time for you to go.” She said, “When?” We scheduled her trip for
                    November.</p>
                <p>Q: There are a few longrunning disputeNorthern Ireland, Israel-Palestine, China-
                    Taiwan, Greece-Turkey. Did we see any role for us in this other major issue,
                    Kashmir?</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: During that same initial period, in the fall of 1997, President
                    Clinton agreed to meet both Prime Minister Gujral and Prime Minister Sharif at
                    the opening of the UN General Assembly in New York. This was another major
                    signal of a new policy of engagement. He had not done that with Indian or
                    Pakistani leaders in his previous four trips to New York. In the meeting with PM
                    Gujral, he made it very clear that we had missed too many opportunities in the
                    past to develop a better relationship with India. He did not want to see any
                    such opportunities pass by again. As we were waiting for PM Sharif to arrive at
                    the U.S. Mission for our next meeting, the President was sort of musing and
                    said, “There are some intractable problems around the world” and he mentioned
                    Northern Ireland, Greece and Turkey, the Balkans, the Middle East, and India and
                    Pakistan and Kashmir. “In almost all of these,” he said, “there's been some
                    movement, but not with India and Pakistan and their dispute over Kashmir. I
                    really would like to see what I can do.”</p>
                <p>Clinton also recognized that the U.S. could not simply step in and mediate. The
                    Indian Government had always been very opposed to outside intervention. Indeed,
                    the two countries themselves had agreed in the 1972 Simla accord, as well as at
                    Lahore in 1999, that they had to work out their differences bilaterally. Of
                    course, the Pakistanis always wanted to get the international community
                    involved, especially the U.S., to 'even the sides' with their much larger
                    neighbor. The President was very attentive to the nuances here, but he did say
                    that he would try to do what he could quietly in meetings like we had in New
                    York to encourage the process to go forward. That continued throughout his
                    second term including when he took his trip in March of 2000 and he said very
                    openly in both India and in Pakistan that the U.S. would play whatever role it
                    could to help the parties resolve their differences peacefully.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression both when you arrived and later about the
                    effectiveness of the Indian embassy to operate within our system and with the
                    Pakistani embassy to operate within our system? Some embassies understand about
                    the importance of Congress and how to walk the halls of Congress, how to play
                    the media. Others go to the State Department and think that's going to take care
                    of things.</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Of the two, the Indian embassy had certain advantages in working on
                    Capitol Hill, beginning with the India Caucus on the House side. It now has
                    about 120 members. That size, which is one of the biggest caucuses in the House,
                    very much relates to the fact that the Indian-American community in this country
                    is now 1.5 million and growing. That community is very successful - and
                    increasingly politically active. Indian-Americans are now making their views
                    known on Capitol Hill and members are listening and responding. This is a
                    longstanding American tradition. Ethnic communities start making their voices
                    heard.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The Pakistani-American community is smaller and less organized. But that does not
                    mean Pakistan itself has not been a factor on Capitol Hill. During the period of
                    the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, when Pakistan was a frontline state, it
                    got almost everything it wanted on the Hill. Pakistan had a lot of powerful
                    friends there, like Congressman Charlie Wilson of Texas. But once that war was
                    over, the U.S. stopping thinking about Afghanistan and Pakistan was left holding
                    the bag with a lot of problemmillions of refugees, drugs, guns. At that same
                    time, this was around 1990, we also imposed sanctions on Pakistan for its
                    nuclear activities. So our relations cooled considerably. During the Cold War,
                    Pakistan had often been a close ally. Now the Cold War was over, and our
                    relations changed.</p>
                <p>The end of the Cold War also resulted in changes in our relations with India. Now
                    it was no longer an erstwhile ally of Moscow. India was opening up its economy.
                    India was identified as one of the 10 “big emerging markets.” American companies
                    were becoming interested. All of this made India more attractive as a partner
                    for the United States. It was also a country with a strong democratic tradition.
                    This had an impact on Capitol Hill.</p>
                <p>Both countries, by the way, had very able representatives in Washington. Riaz
                    Khokhar was the Pakistani ambassador when I took office. We were able to work
                    closely on getting the F-16 issue resolved. The Indian embassy had Naresh
                    Chandra, who was a very experienced Indian official and worked hard on Capitol
                    Hill and in the Executive Branch to see a new page turned in relations between
                    our two countries. He was also able to see a long-standing goal of the Indian
                    community achieved at the end of his stay in Washingtothe unveiling of a
                    wonderful memorial to Gandhi just across from the Indian Embassy on
                    Massachusetts Ave. President Clinton and Prime Minister Vajpayee took part in
                    the dedication ceremony. I was there with Merrie. It is a great addition
                    Washington. I also came to like Naresh very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened about the F-16s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Prime Minister Sharif came here for a visit at the end of 1998, an
                    official working visit. The F-16 issue had not been resolved. The statute of
                    limitations on resolving this was running. If Pakistan did not file a suit suing
                    the U.S., it would lose its ability to take this matter to court. So, Ambassador
                    Khokhar informed me that if this were not resolved soon in a satisfactory
                    manner, Pakistan would have to consider legal action. That got the attention of
                    the Justice Department, which started looking at this very seriously. Justice
                    concluded we had a bad case. So they determined it would be best to go ahead and
                    try to settle this, basically out of court. They turned to something called the
                    Judgment Fund, which allows large sums of money to be paid to settle suits. That
                    fund would cover only a portion of the amount we owed Pakistaa big amount, about
                    $325 million in cash - but we would need to find some way to make up the
                    difference between that and what the Pakistanis had paid. The Pakistanis
                    suggested that we do it in commoditiewheat, soybeans, etc. We were able to do
                    that, over a 2-3 year period.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>I believe the Pakistanis handled this whole episode very well. Their lawyers, a
                    U.S. firm, had apparently advised them that they had a good case and could even
                    get interest on the money they had paid and then didn't get back over an almost
                    ten year period. But they didn't do that. They just wanted their money back. It
                    got so bizarre that at one point we were even charging the Pakistanis storage
                    fees for the planes we had refused to deliver to them! They just wanted it
                    resolved. In the end, President Clinton's statement that this wasn't “fair” was
                    the deciding factor. Khokhar and I signed the agreement on December 19, 1998, in
                    my office. When Riaz left Washington for his next assignment to Beijing, I had a
                    small farewell dinner for him and his wife Shahnaz.I gave him an airplane model
                    of an F-16 aircraft. I said, “Now you can take at least one of these home.” He
                    loved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's turn to another big issue: the nuclear issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: That was a big issue. The new Indian government had been formed in
                    March, 1998, with Atal Bihari Vajpayee as Prime Minister. I went to India with
                    UN Ambassador Bill Richardson shortly after the new government took office.
                    Bruce Reidel, my counterpart on the National Security Council staff, was with
                    us. He was an invaluable partner throughout my time at State. We had good
                    meetings, including with the new Prime Minister, and let the Indians know we
                    wanted to move ahead in our relations.</p>
                <p>We then went to Pakistan and met with Prime Minister Sharif. He expressed some
                    concerns in his assessment of the new Indian government, said a government led
                    by the BJP party was likely to be more “aggressive.” We then went to
                    Afghanistan, the first trip by senior U.S. officials there in a very long time.
                    We came back and reported to Secretary Albright and others. That was in April. A
                    month later, the new Indian government went ahead with a series of five nuclear
                    tests. We had not been given any advance warning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the subject been raised while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: We had urged that the new government continue to exercise nuclear
                    restraint. We received what we took to be expressions of assurances in this
                    regard. Clearly what we had in mind was not exactly what they had in mind. The
                    nuclear tests in May came as a surprise to the U.S. government.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>That morning, May 18, 1998, I convened my senior staff meeting at its usual time,
                    8:40. At 9:00, my special assistant came into the room to say that there was a
                    report on CNN that India had tested nuclear weapons. I asked if my secretary
                    could get Ambassador Celeste on the line in New Delhi. He was not there, but the
                    DCM, Ashley Wills, got on the phone. I said, “Have you heard the CNN report?” He
                    said, “Yes, we've just been given a notice by the Indian government that they
                    have successfully completed a series of nuclear tests.” This was a seismic event
                    in more ways than one! It set into motion a whole series of events and
                    activities that dominated our attention for the next year and a half.One of my
                    first efforts was to respond to Capitol Hill. I testified before both the Senate
                    and the House. Sanctions were required under law, by the Glenn Amendment, and
                    the President imposed them on India immediately after the tests. Economic
                    assistance, any military activities, support for international loans for India
                    were all turned off.</p>
                <p>We also embarked very quickly to try to persuade Pakistan not to follow suit.
                    President Clinton was on the phone with Prime Minister Sharif on five separate
                    occasions making it very clear that he recognized that Pakistan would be under
                    great pressure to test, but that Pakistan's interests would be better served not
                    to and that if it did not, the U.S. was prepared to respond with a number of
                    important steps in Pakistan, including lifting the Pressler sanctions, resuming
                    economic assistance, and reviving our stagnant military relationship. So, a very
                    attractive package was put together to try to dissuade Pakistan from following
                    suit.</p>
                <p>The President and the Secretary directed the Deputy Secretary, Strobe Talbott, to
                    travel to Islamabad to meet with Sharif and try to persuade him not to take that
                    fateful step. I traveled on that trip, as did Bruce. General Anthony Zinni, the
                    CINC [Commander-in-Chief] of the Central Command which covered Pakistan, joined
                    us and provided the transportation. We flew from Andrews to Tampa (Zinni's
                    headquarters) and then flew on his aircraft for 17 hours straight, with two
                    midair refuelings, to Islamabad. We met with PM Sharif and other officials,
                    including the Army Chief of Staff, General Karamat. They listened to us. They
                    did remind us that when Bruce and I had been in Pakistan recently with Bill
                    Richardson they had said, “Don't be too enthusiastic about this government.” We
                    had to go to the 'woodshed' on that one. But we made the best case we could that
                    Pakistan should not go ahead with testing, that that was exactly what India
                    wanted Pakistan to do, thereby imposing U.S. sanctions on both countries. I
                    think there was one more phone call between the President and Sharif and then
                    Pakistan conducted its own series of six nuclear tests. What one does, the other
                    will follow suit. So, Glenn amendment sanctions were now imposed on Pakistan on
                    top of their already existing Pressler sanctions, so they were now doubly
                    sanctioned.</p>

                <p>In response to this, the President and Secretary decided to designate Strobe as
                    the U.S. interlocutor with Indian and Pakistan on non-proliferation and security
                    issues, to see if there was some way to bridge our profound differences. A
                    series of meetings were initiatewe called them dialoguewith the Indians, with
                    Jaswant Singh, who became Foreign Minister while these talks were underway, and
                    Shamshad Ahmad, the Foreign Secretary of Pakistan. We had more than ten rounds
                    of these discussions in various locations trying to see if there was some way to
                    sort through our respective concerns, ours about their nuclear and missile
                    programs and non proliferation, theirs about their security 'compulsions.' For
                    the next year and a half we met in Delhi, Islamabad, Washington, Frankfurt,
                    Rome. We met with the Indians and Pakistanis separately.</p>
                <p>This was a very intense discussion we had, especially with the Indians, and one
                    that we should have had before. This was the first time that the U.S. government
                    was willing to commit itself to that kind of comprehensive discussion. Our hope
                    was to see both governments agree not to test any further and to sign the
                    Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; to negotiate a fissile material cutoff
                    treaty, which was already being discussed in Geneva; to put into place more
                    stringent export controls so that there would be no possibility that their
                    nuclear and missile technology would be exported or there would be any leakage
                    to other countries; and finally to exercise maximum restraint not to deploy
                    their nuclear capabilities. These became known as the “four benchmarks,” which
                    flowed from resolutions that had been passed by the UN Security Council after
                    the May tests and the June G-8 meeting in London. A fifth benchmark was to
                    encourage these two countries to address the issues that were dividing them,
                    including Kashmir.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the interpretation of our embassy in New Delhi of
                        whthis new government took this step?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: The fact that we did not know of the test was seen by many as an
                    intelligence failure. We spend a lot of money for satellites that are supposed
                    to be watching for things like this. You don't conduct a nuclear test without
                    substantial preparation. The Indians, however, were very skillful at deception,
                    camouflage netting, not communicating about the upcoming test. All of these
                    things were part of making sure that they had total secrecy and they achieved
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>But I will say that there was also a policy failure. The BJP government, in its
                    election manifesto, had spoken about inducting the nuclear option. They never
                    said in black and white, “If we form a government, we will test nuclear
                    weapons,” but there was enough in their manifesto, enough in their history of
                    support for India's nuclear weapons program, that this should not have come as
                    an out-of-the-blue surprise. Previous Indian governments had walked up to the
                    decision to test and then backed off. Sometimes we had known they were thinking
                    of testing and, in at least one case, our ambassador went in and said, “We know
                    what you are about to do and we really think that that would be a bad idea.” We
                    didn't have a chance to say that explicitly with the new government of Prime
                    Minister Vajpayee. They made a quick decision as soon as they were in office to
                    test and they did it, and Pakistan responded.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, neither government has tested since. Both have said that they will
                    not be the first to resume testing. Pakistan has said that it is prepared to
                    sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. India appeared to be on the verge of
                    doing so just before the Clinton Administration left office. Now, the new Bush
                    administration says it is opposed to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. So, I'm
                    very concerned that this is going to unravel. We've reached the point where we
                    may have seen an international ban on nuclear testing by all countries. We may
                    now lose that accomplishment.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you see during your time... There seem to be two trends which are rather
                    discouraging. One is the growing fundamentalism in Pakistan and a growing
                    nationalism in India.</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: The short answer is yes. Those are two very important developments,
                    one in Pakistan, one in India. But I think that there are other influences there
                    as well which are more encouraging.</p>
                <p>On the Pakistan side, the growing influence of Islamic extremists is a concern.
                    The Islamic parties have never shown well in Pakistani elections but they do
                    have a strong voice and an active following. This has been of concern to
                    Pakistani leaders, whether it be Nawaz Sharif or to General Musharraf, who
                    overthrew Sharif's civilian government in October of 1999, another big event
                    that occurred when I was Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>On the Indian side, there has been a growing Hindu nationalist movement. That has
                    been part of Indian politics from the very beginning. The BJP party of Prime
                    Minister Vajpayee has its roots in organizations like the RSS, a militant Hindu
                    group. One of its members assassinated Gandhi because he believed he was too
                    pro-Muslim. There are clearly hardliners within the BJP who espouse a number of
                    Hindu nationalist policies and practices. But I believe that the dominant
                    political environment in India is still one that is secular, still one that is
                    trying to have a country that is diverse, that is tolerant, that is democratic.
                    But there are forces at work in both India and Pakistan that are of concern. At
                    this point, the greatest concern is with Pakistan because of the instability
                    that is there, the fact that democracy has never been firmly rooted in Pakistan,
                    and the destabilizing impact events in Afghanistan are having on that
                    country.</p>
                <p>Q: What about this war going on in Kashmir, where the Pakistanis are saying
                    they're not supporting the Kashmiri freedom fighters? Did the Indians put a lot
                    of troops in there? Were we involved in this?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Kashmir will have to be resolved at some point if there is ever going
                    to be any long-term stability in the region. Matters did get worse and very
                    dangerous at one point during the Clinton administration, during the second
                    term, when a small war was fought in Kargil, a sector of Kashmir in the
                    Himalayas.</p>
                <p>Despite their denials, Pakistan is supporting what they call 'freedom fighters'
                    in Kashmir and India calls 'terrorists.' India also has a very large and
                    sometimes very heavy handed security presence in Kashmir. But this dispute is
                    not just about territory. It is about their national identities and their
                    respective visions of what they represent. India as a secular nation says that
                    Kashmir is a part of India, even though it has a Muslim majority. India refuses
                    as a nation to be defined by religion. Pakistan takes a diametrically opposed
                    view. Because of the majority Muslim population, it says Kashmir should be a
                    part of Pakistan. From the very beginning of this conflict, going back to 1947
                    and partition, Pakistan has done everything it can to see Kashmir become a part
                    of Pakistan or to have a referendum, which the early UN Security Council
                    resolutions called for. I believe those resolutions have now been overtaken as a
                    result of the events of the past couple of decades, including the Simla
                    agreement in 1972 and the Lahore Declaration in 1999. But, again, this isn't
                    just about territory. It goes to the real essence of both countries and that's
                    why it is so terribly difficult to resolve.</p>
                <p>As I think I've mentioned, the U.S. has not been able to step in as a mediator
                    because it has not been asked to by both sides, only by onPakistan. But
                    President Clinton did take a real interest in this and wanted to be involved in
                    whatever way he could. On his trip in March 2002 to India and Pakistan, he spoke
                    very publicly about what he said were the “four Rs,” restraint by both sides,
                    respect for the Line of Control which divides the two parts of Kashmir,
                    renunciation of violence (especially the terrorist attacks taking place in
                    Kashmir), and a renewal of the Indo-Pakistan dialogue. The hope was that these
                    “four Rs” would lead to a fifta resolution of the longstanding conflict.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>In just a few days from now we will see, finally, another high level meeting
                    between the two countries, with Prime Minister Vajpayee and General Musharraf,
                    who has just recently become President Musharraf, in Agra. Maybe they will be
                    able to regenerate that “small ripple of hope” that I mentioned took place when
                    I came into office in 1997, when Prime Ministers Sharif and Gujral met in the
                    Maldives and shook hands. Bold steps are needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Clinton trip go? What did Clinton come back
                        with anwhat do you think the impact was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Before discussing the trip, could I mention another important
                    promising moment that occurred during the time I was Assistant Secretary?</p>
                <p>This took place in February of '98. PM Vajpayee traveled by special bus to
                    Lahore, Pakistan, to meet PM Sharif. They signed a very far reaching document,
                    the Lahore Declaration, which committed them to address all the tough issues in
                    their relationship, including Kashmir and nuclear confidence building measures.
                    Again, this was another one of these moments where it looked like the two
                    countries were beginning to look to the future and not to the past. But that was
                    followed just a few months later, in May, by this Kargil crisis when
                    Pakistani-backed forces slipped across the Line of Control to seize some
                    positions left my Indian forces during the winter. Serious fighting took place.
                    Hundreds of insurgents, a lot of them Pakistani for sure, and Indian soldiers
                    died. We went on record early on during the crisis to call for Pakistan to take
                    steps to see those insurgents come back across the LOC. They didn't and the
                    fighting grew worse and we were very concerned that through accident or
                    miscalculation or intention they could be moving toward a full blown war. We
                    were also very aware of the possibility that this could become a nuclear crisis
                    as well.</p>
                <p>In early July President Clinton took a phone call from Prime Minister Sharif
                    saying he had to come to Washington to see him. The President said, “You can
                    come, but if you do, you know what I'm going to ask you to do: to take those
                    steps that will be necessary to bring this crisis to an end.” Sharif and the
                    President met on July 4 at Blair House, across the street from the White House.
                    I was a part of the small U.S. team that was with the President, along with
                    Sandy Berger, Strobe Talbott and Bruce Riedel. At the end of the day, Sharif
                    agreed to go back to Pakistan and give the appropriate instructions, including
                    to his Army Chief of Staff, General Musharraf, to get those insurgents back.
                    Already the Indian forces were beginning to retake the positions they had lost,
                    but the President's agreement with Sharif did accelerate that process, and
                    certainly saved lives and prevented the possibility that the crisis would take a
                    worse turn and escalate. What Sharif got in return was a commitment from
                    President Clinton to take a “personal interest” in encouraging the parties to
                    resume and intensify their efforts to address their differences, which also
                    included the Kashmir issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>Unfortunately, after the Kargil crisis was over, the domestic situation in
                    Pakistan went downhill fast. Prime Minister Sharif had already been putting
                    pressure on a number of sectors of society, including the Parliament and the
                    press. In October he made a move against the Army, specifically General
                    Musharraf as he was returning from a visit to Sri Lanka. The military moved
                    iSharif was out and Musharraf took power. Once again the Army had stepped in to
                    'clean up the mess' of a civilian government. Half of Pakistan's fifty year plus
                    history has been under military rule. India was not pleased to see the military
                    leader who had been behind the Kargil crisis now in charge and, not
                    surprisingly, relations between the two countries went into the deep freeze.
                    That is basically where things have been until now, almost two years later.
                    That's why the upcoming meeting between Vajpayee and Musharraf in Agra is
                    important. The two sides will be on speaking terms again.</p>
                <p>Now, going back to President Clinton's trip. Even after the takeover in Pakistan,
                    he continued to say that he wanted to travel to the region. The decision was
                    finally taken that he would go in early 2000, that he would go to India for an
                    extended visit, he would go to Bangladesh for a first-ever presidential visit,
                    and despite the very strong objection of the Secret Service because of security
                    concerns, the President said that he would also travel for a brief meeting with
                    General Musharraf in Islamabad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: The trip to India was a smashing success and not just from the
                    American perspective, but from the Indian perspective. We had several meetings
                    with the President before we went there, including with a number of South Asian
                    experts in the Cabinet Room. The President really wanted to get as much
                    information as he could from the people that knew the region and the people the
                    besnot just facts and figures but insights and a sense of the sensitivities of
                    those that he was dealing with. Clinton had a great intellectual curiosity. He
                    absorbed information. He also knew that we had, over many years, rubbed the
                    Indians the wrong way because of the way we approached them.</p>
                <p>When we got to Delhi in March, the President was very well received. He gave a
                    major speech to a joint session of the Indian Parliament that I will never
                    forget. Here was an American president talking respectfully to the Indian
                    audience about not only all the great possibilities we now had to establish a
                    strong relationship for the future, but also about the differences we had,
                    including over nuclear matters. But he did all this in a positive way - he used
                    all of his considerable charm and his ability to say difficult things in the
                    right way. At the end of his speech to the parliament, which is known for being
                    at times raucous and sometimes highly critical of the United States, there was
                    this great ovation. Members were actually jumping over tables to have a chance
                    to shake his hand. No one could quite believe it!</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>We spent a total of five days in India, traveling around the country, including
                    to Hyderabad, which is one of their major IT [information technology] centers.
                    He went to Jaipur. He went to Agra. Obviously, one would have to go there for
                    the Taj Mahal, but he also used it to talk about environmental issues. The
                    Indian press reviews were really extraordinary and the glow of that trip
                    continued. The President invited Prime Minister Vajpayee to come to Washington,
                    which he did just a few months later iSeptember. There had been some question
                    about whether to go ahead with this trip since we were already into our
                    presidential campaign, but the Indian government decided wisely that it was very
                    important to solidify this new relationship and do it with the President who had
                    already demonstrated his commitment to making it work.</p>
                <p>The visit to Pakistan was of a different order. It was only a five hour visit.
                    Security was very tight and the Secret Service had decided some extraordinary
                    measures to protect the President were in order. We were flying out of Bombay
                    [Mumbai] to Islamabad. We did not take Air Force One, the President's big 747.
                    Instead, we went out on the tarmac and the President headed first to a military
                    transport plane and then he went to another one - an unmarked, small executive
                    jet. A Secret Service agent that had his height and build and grey hair got on
                    an identical plane next to it with the identification “United States of
                    America.” I was on the small plane with the President along with Madeleine
                    Albright, Sandy Berger, Joe Lockhart, the press secretary, John Podesta, the
                    chief of staff, and Bruce Riedel. We briefed him on the short flight, although
                    part of the time he was asleeclearly he was not too worried about all this! When
                    the other plane marked “United States of America” arrived in Islamabad, it
                    pulled up to a reviewing stand, stopped, and then taxied away. We then landed
                    with the President. All of this was done to make certain that there was not
                    something waiting for the President either in the air or on the ground.</p>
                <p>But Clinton was determined to go to Pakistan, despite the security concerns,
                    because he wanted to make it clear that we have had a longstanding relationship
                    with that country, we have been allies, and we were not about to turn our back
                    on Pakistan even through we had a number of fundamental concernlike the recent
                    military takeover, Pakistan's support for the Taliban in Afghanistan, the
                    nuclear issues. The President met with General Musharraf and he gave a very
                    important speech to the Pakistani people on nationwide television. Then we
                    departed with the hope of maintaining a relationship and finding something to
                    work with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about trade with India? India is extremely
                        protectionist?Were you able to pry open the doors?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: That is going to be a long term effort. India is taking steps to open
                    up its economy for direct foreign investment and trade. It has made substantial
                    progress since the early 1990s. But the level of trade is still way below what
                    it should be. Just compare this to where we are with China and you'll see how
                    far India has to go. But it has recently announced the removal of further
                    restrictions. Information technology is probably the most promising point of
                    economic contact between the two countries. I'm convinced that this is an
                    economic relationship that will find itself and fulfill its potential over time,
                    but it's going to take more patience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Afghanistan continues to be one of the great tragedies of the world
                    today. There's been over two decades of occupation and fighting, first with the
                    Soviet invasion, then the civil war after the Soviets left in 1989, and now with
                    the Taliban. There appeared to be a small chance for some progress to end the
                    fighting in Afghanistan at the time I went there with UN Ambassador Bill
                    Richardson in April 1998. Bruce Riedel was with us, so was Tom Simons, our
                    Ambassador to Pakistan, and Andrea Mitchell of NBC News. We went to Kabul on a
                    small UN jet. We met with the Taliban for several hours. Mullah Rabbani, the
                    number two at that time in the Taliban, was their top person in the talks. We
                    then flew to a city in the north, Sheberghan, to meet with the leaders of the
                    Northern Alliance, including General Dostum and former Afghan President Rabbani.
                    There was a Washington Post headline after that visit saying that “The U.S. Wins
                    Promise of Peace Talks in Afghanistan.” I think that promise lasted about a day!
                    We were just one of many who tried and failed. At some point peace will prevail
                    in Afghanistan, but it's going to take more time. Tragically, Afghanistan has
                    become a focus for international terrorism with Osama Bin Laden there and one of
                    the world's centers for the drug trade. It also continues to suffer from a
                    humanitarian crisis because of a drought that's now in its third year and an
                    economy that is not a functioning economy at all. These are all great concerns
                    and it's one of the areas of South Asia which does require more attention from
                    the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were there, was there anything much we
                        couldo with Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: What we could and did do was to provide humanitarian assistance -
                    $100 million in each of the last two years I was in office, making us the
                    largest international donor there for food and medical assistance and help with
                    clearing landmines. We also worked with other countries, including the Russians
                    (I traveled to Moscow on several occasions and Russian officials came to
                    Washington), to coordinate our approach on Afghanistan. We went to the UN
                    Security Council and obtained two resolutions demanding that the Taliban expel
                    Bin Laden so that he could be brought to justice and to close down terrorist
                    training camps in the country. Sanctions were imposed. They were targeted on the
                    Taliban and every effort was made to see that these sanctions did not make
                    matters worse for the Afghan people. But to date, Mullah Omar and his regime
                    have not changed course. It's very hard to understand how to get through to such
                    'true believers.' The effort continues to be made and should be made to speak
                    with them, but so far, we simply haven't gotten on the right frequency.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the considered opinion of people both inside and outside government
                    when looking at the Taliban? Did they see this as a temporary thing or as having
                    longer lasting consequences?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: I think that you could find several points of view on that. We have
                    an excellent Afghan expert in the State Department, Professor Marvin Weinbaum,
                    who has saiand I would like to believe that he is righthat the Taliban
                    represents a transitional period in Afghanistan recent history, that the
                    repressive regime they represent is not sustainable over time, that Afghans are
                    too independent, and that eventually Afghans will remove the Taliban. The
                    question is, how long will that take and what will follow? There, I think we
                    have no answers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the teardrop, India, Sri Lanka? Did that raise
                        much oa problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: The one event that continues to define the country is the war between
                    the government and the LTTE, the Tamil Tigers. The conflict there is now going
                    on 17 years. Thousands of people have been killed, thousands more displaced.
                    There have been horrific examples of terrorism, including suicide bombers.
                    Secretary Albright designated the LTTE a foreign terrorist organization (FTO)
                    soon after taking office so that there would be no mistaking our view on the
                    nature of the Tamil Tigers and their tactics. At the same time, we tried to
                    encourage the government and the main opposition party to establish some process
                    to end this peacefully. I traveled to Colombo three times as Assistant Secretary
                    and said that the U.S. would be willing to do what we could as one of many
                    concerned nations, including India which has a strong interest in Sri Lanka
                    because of its own Tamil population, to support a negotiated end to the conflict
                    - one that would maintain Sri Lanka's territorial integrity. We don't support
                    creating an independent Tamil state and dividing up the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>So far, there has been no real movement toward ending that conflict, although the
                    Norwegians have now undertaken a mediation effort that we support. The tragedy
                    of Sri Lanka is that it is probably the most advanced of any South Asia country
                    in terms of literacy and other social and economic indicators. It is a country
                    with great potential, but it is being bled by this war. Hopefully one day this
                    will come to an end and the U.S. can help in this process.</p>
                <p>Q: Madeleine Albright from the point of many and particularly of those in the
                    Foreign Service came on board as Secretary of State with great... People really
                    looked forward to it. When she left, it had not been a happy relationship. It
                    was by some accounts the management. How did you find this?</p>
                <p>INDERFURTH: Let me come at your question this way. One of her highest priorities
                    when she took office was to try to reverse the downward trend in funding and
                    resources for the Department. She felt very strongly that the Department and its
                    embassies abroad are America's 'first line of defense,' and that we were being
                    shortchanged by Congress. She launched a charm offensive with the Chairman of
                    the Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms. Something of an odd couple, you
                    might say, but there you have it. She wanted to get him more on the side of the
                    Foreign Service and the State Department, as opposed to being an obstructionist,
                    “Senator No” as he was known. At a softball game between State and Helms'
                    office, the secretary presented the senator with a t-shirt saying, “Someone at
                    the State Department Loves Me.” She traveled to Wingate College in North
                    Carolina, Helms' alma mater, to speak with the senator at her side. She put an
                    enormous of time into this effort, one that was so critically important to the
                    building and to the Foreign Service. This was one area that she tried to make a
                    real difference as head of the Department, and she got results. The downward
                    slide in funding was stopped and a slight increase took its place. Not enough,
                    but at least it was now moving in the right direction.</p>
                <p>So that was an important contribution that I think Madeleine Albright made during
                    her tenure at the Department. But I would like to return, again, to what I
                    consider will be her greatest contribution as Secretary of State (and earlier as
                    UN Ambassador), namely her determined, dogged effort to see the United States
                    take a stanand use force if necessary - about what was taking place in the
                    former Yugoslavia, first in Bosnia and then later in Kosovo. This was a primary
                    focus of hers throughout her eight years in the Clinton Administration. As much
                    as being the first woman Secretary of State, I think this will be her lasting
                    legacy. Recently I heard that she is considered to be the “Mother” of the UN War
                    Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is now trying Milosevic at The
                    Hague. That is a well deserved compliment!</p>

                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>INDERFURTH: There is no question that I am pointed towards a continuing
                    involvement in international affairs, in whatever capacity is available to me. I
                    must say that if the opportunity to serve in government again were there, I
                    would love to do it. I think there is no finer calling than public service, and
                    none more interesting. These four years as Assistant Secretary and the previous
                    four at the UN were the high point of my professional career. I feel very
                    privileged. I'm very pleased that I had these appointments and was able to be
                    associated with so many people I liked and respected in the State Department,
                    the National Security Council, the Washington policy community, and at the
                    United Nations. Whether it be through teaching at the Elliott School at George
                    Washington University, which I am doing; or working with the UN, which I'm now
                    doing on Afghanistan on Track II diplomacy; or working on nuclear threat
                    reduction, which is a project that I've been involved in for several months; or
                    serving on the board of the Landmine Survivors Network, which I recently joined,
                    I'm keeping up my interest and focus on international affairs. You move in life
                    through different phases and different incarnations and this is a new one for
                    me. And I am enjoying iand hopefully making some contribution.</p>
