                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is November 3, 1994. I'm sitting in the office of
                        Monsignor George Higgins, an old friend, in Curley Hall at Catholic
                        University. We are going to go over the work he has done over the past 45
                        years that I know of, but even longer than that; how he came into the
                        international field and his interest in it; and his observations on a number
                        of subjects which we will be discussing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Won't you begin by giving a little bit about your family background so we know
                    where you came from, and a reference, if you don't mind, to the book in which
                    some interesting details of your early life are already given in the first, very
                    interesting, autobiographical chapter.</p>
                <p>HIGGINS: I am a native of Chicago. I came to Catholic University after I was
                    ordained a priest to study labor economics, and then stayed on — and I'm still
                    here.</p>
                <p>Some of the background, which is of no great interest here, is in the book that
                    you referred to, Organized Labor and the Church, published by the Paulist Press
                    in Mahwah, New Jersey, which gives just “a once over lightly” of my early
                    experience. But before we get into any details, I would like to say that my
                    involvement in the international field was very limited. It was not, by any
                    means, a full-time exercise with me. I can tell you how I first got interested
                    in it and then go on from there.</p>
                <p>You recall, I'm sure, that under the military government in Germany, there was a
                    section on religious affairs and they used to bring people over from the United
                    States, on three or four month tours. I was one of those who was asked to come
                    over to do a report on the relationship between the Church in Germany and the
                    German trade union movement. At that time, everyone was concerned about whether
                    or not the Germans would be able to combine the trade union movements into one,
                    unified movement. I spent three or four months in Germany at that time and
                    eventually put out a report, which I don't have anymore. I have a copy in the
                    Archives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say the Archives, you mean, which?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>HIGGINS: At Catholic University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: But as a result of going to Germany on that assignment, I had some free
                    time. I could travel in between my chores on the assignment, and I moved around
                    Europe a bit. I went to the ILO (International Labor Organization) and visited
                    as many labor people as I could meet. That's how I first got interested in it.
                    It was rather by happenstance. If I had not gone to Germany on that assignment,
                    the chances are I would have done very little in the international field,
                    because my job here in Washington was on domestic affairs. But, because of that
                    experience, then whenever I went to Europe after that, which was rather
                    frequently in those days, I would stop by to see the Labor Attach�s and see the
                    people in the labor movement that I knew or could get in contact with. It was a
                    sort of an informal, unorganized involvement that I had. I never had an
                    assignment from my own organization to do international work. I just did it on
                    my own, as a result of that trip to Germany. That's how it began.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us the circumstances of your getting this assignment
                        to spend some time in Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: There was a priest on the staff of the Conference who, for reasons that
                    I don't recall. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say the Conference, you mean the. . . ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: The National Catholic Welfare Conference in those days, now called the
                    United States Catholic Conference. There was a priest on the staff who, for
                    reasons that I don't recall, had contact with this Religious Affairs Office [of
                    the U.S. Military Government in Germany], and they used him as the intermediary
                    in suggesting people who might be invited to come over. I remember John Courtney
                    Murray was invited over to do a report on Church-State Relations; someone else
                    went over on Education. There were a number of people. This priest, who was a
                    friend of mine, nominated me to go over and do this report on the Church and
                    labor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you put a date to that? 1948? 1949?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: 1949, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1949.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HIGGINS: My memory on dates is very bad, but it was 1949, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: I had no contact myself with anybody in the U.S. Government. This was
                    done through this priest on the staff who, for his own reasons, had contact and
                    was asked to be the intermediary in getting people to go over. There were many
                    divisions in the military government, and I'm sure there were dozens of people
                    doing the same thing. This was only in religious affairs. I don't recall the
                    names of most of the people I worked with in Germany at the time. The man in
                    charge of the particular office I dealt with is dead, I think. His name was
                    Arild Olson, a native of Iowa. I believe he had been a minister, but I'm not
                    sure. I don't remember the other names. I had a free-wheeling assignment — just
                    go out around Germany. They gave me a driver and a military car. I could go
                    anywhere I wanted and talk to anybody I wanted about that one specific subject,
                    the Church and labor. So, I met with individual priests and organizations and a
                    few bishops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not with the labor people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: With the labor people, sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I mean the labor people in the military
                        government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Not that I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: I could have, but I'm very hazy on that. I don't recall having any
                    specific dealings with that section, but I may have. I could be wrong on that.
                    As I say, the only copy of the report that I have is over in my own papers in
                    the Catholic University Archives, and I haven't looked at it in years. My
                    general recollection is that I came down rather optimistically expressing the
                    hope that there would be a united [labor] movement.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I felt, at the time, that some people in the U.S. Government, and perhaps some in
                    the labor movement, leaned too far to the Socialist side and didn't quite
                    understand where the old Christian trade unions were coming from. That was a
                    cultural problem, because Americans had no experience with that kind of trade
                    unionism. But I ran into no difficulties in that regard. My own conclusion was
                    that it would be good for Germany if they could have a united movement and, of
                    course, they do now. And they did shortly thereafter. That issue has never risen
                    again, as far as I know, in Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your report is in the Archives.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Of the Catholic University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Under your name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: My name, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: All my papers — good, bad and indifferent — are in the Archives here. I
                    have never looked at them. They are fairly well catalogued, I think, not down to
                    specifics, but the general categories are well-catalogued.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Open to students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Oh, sure. They are open to anybody. I have no restrictions on the papers
                    at all. But that's how I got started. I never thought I would be going to
                    Europe, but once I was there, I took advantage of it. I had an opportunity to
                    travel, and I did travel a good bit during that four month period. It was the
                    first time I ever visited the ILO.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I can tell you one story on this cultural difference between the old Christian
                    unions and the Socialist unions. I was traveling, in my spare time, with an
                    American priest friend of mine, who happened to be studying in Europe. We joined
                    together and decided to do a little traveling. We went to the ILO. This priest
                    had done a year's internship with the AFL-CIO, so he was known to George Meany
                    and the rest of the crowd. We stayed in the same hotel in Geneva with Meany and
                    Mrs. Meany. We ran into them in the lobby one afternoon. Since Meany knew this
                    man, and he knew me, he said, “What are you doing for dinner, tonight?” [I
                    replied,] “Nothing.” Well, he said, “My wife and I are going to a dinner
                    sponsored by the Swiss Labor Movement. Why don't you come along?” [My friend
                    said,] “Fine. We'll meet you in the lobby at 6:30.” About six o'clock, we got a
                    call [from Meany] in our room. “A little mix up,” he said, “The Swiss labor
                    movement said it doesn't think it would be appropriate to have a priest, or two
                    priests, come to their dinner.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With or without an invocation..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Yes, with or without an invitation. It was not done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I said, with or without an invocation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Yes. It just wasn't done. I can give you another story related to that,
                    but it has nothing to do with my own involvement in Europe. You remember the
                    name of Gaston Tessier?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: A very devout Catholic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have to interrupt these things to say who he was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Tessier was President of the French Christian Trade Union Movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>HIGGINS: A very devout, old-line Catholic. He came to the United States — I was
                    not present — he came to an ILO meeting in San Francisco. There was a
                    French-speaking American priest in San Francisco, who had studied here, in my
                    time, at Catholic U. His mother was French and he spoke French fluently. So,
                    they seated him next to Tessier at the dinner. This priest was then asked to
                    give the invocation, and Tessier was astounded, not to say shocked, that there
                    would be an invocation at a meeting of that kind in the United States. He said
                    that would never happen in France. Tessier as much as said, “We wouldn't permit
                    it to happen in France.” It just wasn't done. So, he couldn't quite see how in
                    the world a trade union movement — This was sponsored by the local trade unions
                    in San Francisco — would have a clergyman come in to give an invocation.</p>
                <p>But the Meany incident with the Swiss trade union movement was quite revealing.
                    It would have been embarrassing to them to have a clergyman come in. It was
                    somewhat embarrassing to Meany, but it didn't bother us, because we went out to
                    dinner some place else. But I cite that as only one little example.</p>
                <p>Another example comes to my mind of how things have changed. While I was in
                    Europe, I went to Holland, briefly, just to look around. At that time, as you
                    may recall, Holland was completely ghetto-ized. The Socialists had their own
                    papers. The Catholics had their own papers, even their own radio stations. The
                    Protestants had their own papers. The Communists had their own papers. And they
                    all had separate unions. It was a matter almost of excommunication for a
                    Catholic to belong to anything except a Catholic trade union movement. I had, at
                    one time, the document in which that was laid out. I lost it unfortunately, and
                    I've never been able to find another copy. But, I do recall that it was signed
                    by all the bishops of Holland, including one by the name of Bernard Alfrink, who
                    was a very young bishop, probably an auxiliary. I found out, later, when I went
                    to the Vatican Council that Alfrink was one of the great liberals in the
                    council, and today, of course, the ghetto-ized culture of Holland is completely
                    gone, absolutely completely gone. There are no more Catholic organizations of
                    any kind. All of that structured ghetto-ization is completely broken down. I
                    would think that of all the countries in Europe, maybe of all the countries in
                    the world, the breakdown in the ghetto-ized Catholic culture has gone the
                    furthest in Holland, whereas it was the tightest in those days. That's how fast
                    things have changed.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>The only thing I could compare it with would be French Canada. The first time I
                    went to French Canada, the so-called Christian trade unions there were very
                    conservative. They were very clerical — I think they all had a chaplain. — and
                    completely separated from the other unions in Canada. Today that's all gone. The
                    former so-called Christian unions, former Christian Trade Unions of French
                    Canada, as far as I can see, are now the most radical of all the unions. The
                    influence of the Church is gone. There is no such thing as a chaplain. They
                    wouldn't allow a chaplain to get anywhere near them. The same kind of cultural
                    transformation [has occurred] in French Canada that took place in Holland, where
                    you had a kind of in-bred ghetto-ized church, aggravated by the fact that it was
                    still highly agricultural [with lots of] small towns. That's all gone. And of
                    the two places that I know in the world, the most rapid cultural change in the
                    Church since the Second Vatican Council involving also the labor movement are in
                    those two [places] — Holland and French Canada. I cite them, [even though] they
                    have nothing to do with your question, because they are examples of how things
                    have changed.</p>
                <p>As far as Germany is concerned, I went back to Germany a few times after that,
                    just on holiday or vacation, and met a number of the trade union leaders. As far
                    as I could see the Einheitsgewerkshaft [unified trade union] was working out
                    well and I hear nothing about it anymore. There's still a division between the
                    parties in Germany — There's the Christian Democratic Party and the Social
                    Democratic Party. — but I don't think it flows over into the trade union field.
                    At least I've never heard that it has. But that was my original involvement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, what I would appreciate and what I think our project
                        would be very interested in is the sequence of events within the Church and,
                        as far as you can comment on it, outside the Church which led to the almost
                        secularization of the Catholic trade union movement from the point of view
                        of these ICFTU-oriented unions. Those of us serving for the [U.S.]
                        Government saw a change gradually take place, partly because of their
                        attitude towards capitalism and partly because of the developments that you
                        have seen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Well, the most radical change, of course, came long after the period
                    we're talking about. It came with the Second Vatican Council. That was the major
                    turning point in the history of Catholicism in the last hundred or two hundred
                    years. It was a very radical change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: 1962 to 1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you spent, by the way, the whole time there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>HIGGINS: I was there for that, yes. There were four sessions, [one] every fall —
                    1962, 1963, 1964 and 1965. [The Council] ended in 1965 and developed 16 or 18
                    major documents. The total impact of the Council, not only of the documents
                    themselves, but of the event itself, was a major, major change in the history of
                    world Catholicism. There have been dozens and dozens of books written on that,
                    but that came after the period we were talking about, when I was in Germany.</p>
                <p>The changes before the Council that might have led up to it, I would be hard to
                    put to trace them back to their origins. Part of change, I think, had something
                    to do with the war — the realization on the part of everyone that they could not
                    go back to what they had before the Second World War, and that if there had been
                    a united labor movement under Hitler, they might have done better. I think that
                    was in the back of the minds of some people. [There was] a general realization
                    that everybody was involved now in a new world. They had to take a new look at
                    everything, because we had gone through this terrible war and gone through the
                    Holocaust and everything that went with that. I think that had some bearing on
                    it. But, it took time. I don't recall, when I was in Germany, that there was any
                    bitter feeling between the groups. There were differences, of course. There was
                    some resentment on the part of some of the Catholics in the Christian trade
                    union movement that the Socialists had a kind of imperial attitude, that they
                    were the dominant movement and “tough luck for you fellows, you're not involved
                    in it.” [There was] also, I won't say resentment, but some bewilderment that the
                    Americans, when they came to Europe, didn't understand the situation at all,
                    because it wasn't in their experience. We had never had sectarian unions in the
                    United States, so that it was not uncommon for American trade unionists to come
                    over and rather absent-mindedly almost take the side of the Socialists, because
                    they were the dominant union. “What is this business of sectarianism?” They
                    didn't understand it at all. They had no cultural or historical memory to go on.
                    That was very common. There was some resentment on the part of some of the
                    people that I recall talking to in those days.</p>
                <p>But, as I said, my major conclusion was that it would be better for everybody
                    concerned if they could have a united movement and I was fairly optimistic that
                    they would. They do now, of course, and have had for some time. But you asked me
                    to trace the origins of that?.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>HIGGINS: I don't think there was anything in church documents that did it. There
                    was no major change, say, between 1930 and 1949, in Church documents that made
                    that more possible. It was more, I think, the culture of the times. The official
                    church documents, the last one before 1949 was in 1931, Quadragesimo Anno. That
                    was still rather tough on socialism. There was no break-through, there. So, it
                    didn't come out of official documents. I think it came out of the experience of
                    people, and I can't help but think that the war had a lot to do with it. They
                    had suffered together in the war; they had seen, I think, that it didn't make
                    any sense to be divided, if you were going to have an enemy like Hitler. The
                    general mood of the time, I think, was “Let's see if we can't work together for
                    the good of the country and this new world we're going into.” But, beyond that,
                    I would have to go back and meditate for hours to try to figure out what the
                    reasons were. It's very clear after 1962, after the Council, that is easy to
                    measure, because the changes of the Council were so dramatic, that there's no
                    question that that had a major, major impact. But the uniting of the labor
                    movement in Germany came along before that, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the continued separation in other countries. I'm going
                        to ask you, later on, about the degree to which you had comments on France,
                        Italy and other countries, from traveling there because the separation
                        continued in these other countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The personality of John the XXIII. . . ?</p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Well, that was much after our period. See, he didn't become the Pope
                    until the late 1950s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, I'm saying, did his personality affect the
                        creation of Vatican II?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Oh, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the point.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>HIGGINS: It would have been impossible without him, and he put his stamp on it,
                    in a very indirect way. He never interfered in the Council or seldom interfered
                    with it. He was seldom in the Council. They say that he observed it on TV. I
                    don't know whether he did or not. But he was very light-handed. His opinion was,
                    “It's time to get the bishops of the world together and let them talk and let
                    them get to know one another. The more freedom the better.” So he allowed almost
                    unlimited freedom in the Council, even though, as the President, he could have
                    exercised control, if he wanted to. But he exercised very little control. He
                    clearly left the impression, by his personality and by his whole mode of
                    operation, that he wanted freedom. When he intervened, it was usually on the
                    side of freedom. Occasionally he would intervene to make sure that what he
                    thought was a legitimate point of view was getting a fair hearing. There's no
                    doubt he had enormous influence. But, of course, he died after the first
                    session, and the Council then went on without him. So, it wasn't only the Pope
                    [that made the Council successful, but also the work done within] the Council
                    itself.</p>
                <p>I've had a very clear impression — It has nothing to do with our specific
                    subject, but I've said this many times to other people. — that what made the
                    Council a success was it lasted four years. It took four years, well, four
                    sessions, and many sessions in between, of course, with committees. It took a
                    long time for 3,000 or 2,500 bishops from all the cultures of the world to
                    develop their own dynamics. If that Council had lasted only one session, I think
                    it would have been a failure, and we wouldn't be talking about it today. It
                    would have been just a passing event, forgotten by now. But it developed its own
                    inner dynamics because for four years, bishops from all over the world — and
                    there were theologians and other advisors — built up their own understanding of
                    the dynamics of this organization. Very important, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I saw that you covered that in the book.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Yes, I think it's very important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But as for the final documents of Vatican II, what were
                        the origin and the sort of decisions with respect to labor, and how did they
                        affect individual countries, so far as you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>HIGGINS: There was very little specifically on labor. The major document that
                    touches upon our field was the one on The Church and the Modern World. The first
                    part of that document is philosophical and religious; the second part applies it
                    to the family, to economics, to politics, etcetera. The section on economics is
                    not startlingly new. The only specific reference that I recall to labor is a
                    strong insistence on the freedom of trade unions, [i.e.,] free from government
                    control. There was some feeling on the part of a few of the consultants and
                    delegates to go easy on Spain, but they went the opposite way. There's a very
                    strong statement that unions should be free and independent, but there was no
                    extended treatment of unions. But it was the general atmosphere that affected
                    it, not the specifics — the opening to the world, the need for dialogue and
                    inter-religious cooperation, which was a very marked change in the Church. All
                    of those things added up to more than the specific statements. You won't find
                    anything startlingly new in the document about labor or about any other specific
                    question, but you'll find a lot that's startlingly new in the total
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you selected to be going to Rome?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Well, they had a number of people, dozens and dozens of people, who were
                    so-called periti experts or consultants. How I was chosen, I'm not sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you say, piredial?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Well, the Latin word, periti. It means experts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: P-A?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: P-E-R-I-T-I. That means consultants or experts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: There were many, many theologians and others, some of them much more
                    influential than others. I had no great influence on the Council. But there were
                    some distinguished theologians who had enormous influence in drafting
                    documents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any lay people involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>HIGGINS: Yes. Oh, yes. Not too many. Not as many as there should have been, but
                    there were, men and women. But I would think if we had another Council in five
                    years from now, ten years from now, twenty, there would be many more lay people.
                    It would be a Council brought up to date. But I don't know how I was selected.
                    Some friend of mine in Rome probably put my name in, but I really don't know. I
                    was there not only for the four sessions of the Council but for the two years
                    preceding it, the so-called preparatory stages when commissions were meeting. So
                    to me, it was the greatest experience of my life. Nothing is even comparable to
                    it, because it was the greatest single event in the history of the Church in the
                    last hundred, two hundred years, without any question — maybe in the last five
                    hundred years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hope we can go into the impact of those revolutionary
                        events on the individual countries and how the Church, in the labor field at
                        least, interpreted or misinterpreted what came out of the Vatican II in
                        individual countries in which activities were so different.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Well, I wouldn't be able to say very much about that, because I don't
                    know that much about the individual countries. I've cited the case of Holland.
                    That's a very clear example of where the Council resulted — and they have gone
                    from one extreme to the other — in a complete breakdown of the former cultural
                    structures of the country, complete.</p>
                <p>So today anyone who would suggest a Christian trade union in Holland would
                    probably be laughed at. Whereas, before the Council, it was almost a matter of
                    excommunication for a Catholic to belong to any union that wasn't a Catholic
                    union, and, as far as I can see from reading about Holland, you read a Catholic
                    newspaper, you went to a Catholic doctor, . . .</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any explanation as to why that is completely
                        gone in a country like Holland and yet the remnants of it remain in a
                        country like Austria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: No, I really don't. That would take a cultural anthropologist and
                    historian.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. I'd like to get your observations. I think, I don't
                        know, I think you're guilty of a little bit too much modesty because in your
                        book, you discuss observing Latin America, for instance. I've been
                        encouraged by one of the members of the advisory committee to our project,
                        Ben Martin, to get you to discuss what you observed and how you explain the
                        difference in attitude in Latin America, which you did in your book. You do
                        discuss Church activities. Now, they may not have been Church activities but
                        the activities of individual groups within the churches in Latin America and
                        Spain and Portugal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: I honestly don't recall what I said specifically on that in the book.
                    I'd have to go back and check it. But, there's been a tremendous change in Latin
                    America through liberation theology, of course, and that came after the Council.
                    Before the Council, there was none of that. The changes in the labor movement
                    probably have not been all that radical. You still have something that's
                    remotely called a Christian Trade Union Federation, quite separate from the
                    Church as an institution. [It is] still somewhat at odds with ORIT and the older
                    unions, and again, in my haphazard dealings with people in Latin America, just
                    occasional dealings, you sense some of that same, I won't say resentment, but
                    somewhat sense of bewilderment, that Americans don't understand what the
                    differences are between the two organizations. [Americans] tend automatically to
                    think that since the AFL-CIO is in ORIT, that therefore there's something wrong
                    about. . .any union which [describes] itself as having some Christian
                    inspiration.</p>
                <p>I remember bringing some of the CLAT people to Washington ten years ago, now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: CLAT people. We have to [explain that term].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Yes, CLAT is the Christian Federation of unions in Latin America. I
                    haven't had much to do with them recently, but about ten years ago, I sponsored
                    a dinner meeting at a club downtown between several CLAT representatives and
                    several representatives of the AFL-CIO. I invited some other guests. Once we had
                    finished dinner, they said, “We're leaving. This is a private meeting now
                    between CLAT and the AFL-CIO.” I never did hear, in detail, what came out of it
                    except that it was a friendly meeting and that there have been, since then, a
                    number of contacts. But I haven't heard anything in the last five years. I would
                    say there was no great love lost between CLAT and Bill Doherty, for example, of
                    AIFLD (American Institute for Free Labor Development). They are just in two
                    different worlds.</p>
                <p>On the general question of Latin America, the changes came from the Council.
                    There was a brand new involvement of the Church. It goes under the general
                    heading of “liberation theology,” which means different things to different
                    people. It was a conscious decision on the part of at least some Church leaders
                    to reverse history, which had involved the Church too often in the past with the
                    upper class, sometimes with dictatorial governments, to go to the poor. That's
                    an oversimplification of what liberation theology is, but that came out of the
                    council.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in going to the poor, why did that involve, also,
                        attributing to the other trade unions, sort of ICFTU-oriented ORIT trade
                        unions, attributing them being overly pro-capitalist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Well, that's the Latin American culture. Capitalism, to them, has a bad
                    ring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: American imperialism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: And a bad ring, of course. Not all of them, but to many. I think they're
                    getting over it, to some extent. I'll give you an example. When the American
                    bishops issued their Pastoral letter on the economy in 1986, it was severely
                    criticized by neo-conservatives in this country, especially Michael Novak and
                    that crowd, but it was also criticized severely by the left wing of the
                    Liberation Movement, because it didn't attack capitalism. Well, that was never
                    its purpose. Its purpose was to talk about the American economy, not to write a
                    philosophical dissertation about capitalism versus socialism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or democracy versus. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Yes. I've found the criticism from the left wing of the Liberation
                    Movement very superficial. I don't think they understood American capitalism,
                    and they never made it clear what they meant by socialism. Some of the
                    Liberation theologians who had advocated socialism, well, what does it mean?
                    Then along came the fall of communism in Europe, and they were really left high
                    and dry. One of them, who has since left the priestly ministry and is one of the
                    leading spokesmen for the left wing of the Liberation Movement, Father Leonardo
                    Boff, had the bad luck of going to Russia not too long before the fall and
                    coming back a Latin American praising it as an example of socialism. So, they
                    were very fuzzy about socialism. I think, however, you'll find today that if you
                    read seriously in liberation theology, they've gotten away from most of that.
                    The emphasis, now, is on democracy. There's more emphasis, I think, on working
                    with organizations like the trade union movement, cooperatives, etcetera, and
                    much less of theoretical talk about capitalism versus socialism. But it's quite
                    understandable to me why Latin Americans don't like capitalism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has exploited them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>HIGGINS: Because it has a bad name. I remember being in Brazil one time, over ten
                    years ago now, with a group of Americans, and among other people, we visited the
                    auxiliary bishop in the section of Sao Paulo where the automobile industry is
                    centered. A very nice young man and a very strong defender of the trade union
                    movement in Brazil. He used to open his cathedral for their meetings, etcetera.
                    But in one of our meetings, he went into a long, I won't say diatribe, but a
                    long criticism of the American trade union movement. It was tied in with
                    capitalism. And I said, “Bishop, really, I hate to say this, but if I had the
                    money, I would give it to you right now and bring you to Detroit and let you sit
                    down with the people in the Auto Workers Union. I think you'll find out that you
                    do not have anywhere in all of Latin America a union which is as aggressively
                    pro-worker as the UAW is in the United States.” Q: It's not anti-capitalist.</p>
                <p>HIGGINS: I said, “You are really talking theory.” And he was. He was very nice
                    about it, but he had a theoretical concept. Since the American unions and the
                    UAW specifically were working with capitalism, therefore they were
                    pro-capitalist. Then I said, “Really, you don't have a union anywhere in all of
                    Latin America that can even remotely compare with the UAW in its devotion to the
                    interest of the workers.” And, they don't, of course. Latin Americans are great
                    for theories, rhetoric and long speeches. I remember being at one meeting of
                    CLAT, this confederation of former so-called Christian trade unions, where it
                    would be common for them to speak for an hour and a half or two hours, flowing,
                    theoretical. . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, if you can't do anything, you like to speak about
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Well, its part of their culture, too. I remember being in Cuba, right
                    after the revolution, before Castro really went over the hill and identified
                    himself as a Communist. He spoke for seven hours, one night, on television.
                    Seven hours! And nobody seemed to be surprised by it. I was traveling [at the
                    time] with another priest. We turned it on in our hotel. We then went to have a
                    drink with John Correll, who was the Labor Attach�, and it was on in his
                    apartment. We went to dinner, and it was on in the restaurant. We came back to
                    our hotel ,and it was still on. Seven hours. (Pause)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, I would like to go over some of your reactions to the
                        work and the relationships between the various unions in the countries you
                        can speak about, and especially your reactions to the U.S. Government
                        positions taken, the individuals involved, and what you think we should have
                        done that the government didn't do in the labor field or whatever
                        evaluations you wish to give.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>HIGGINS: Well, my recollections are vague in that, and I didn't have that much
                    exposure to any particular country. I'd be in and out a day at a time more on
                    holiday than anything else. My general impression of that period is — We're
                    speaking now of the early 1950s — that the labor attach�s were a superior group
                    of people and extremely helpful to me. I always touched base with them when I'd
                    go into France or wherever. They were extremely helpful. I must say, by
                    contrast, my more recent experience is different, not that they are not helpful.
                    I never met a labor attach� who wasn't helpful. But they don't seem to have the
                    same feel for the labor problems that some of the earlier ones did. I don't even
                    remember the names of all of them that I dealt with. My overall impression is
                    that that early original bunch of labor attach�s were competent and extremely
                    helpful and on the whole, I thought, fair. I never had any problems with any of
                    them showing any prejudice one way or the other. Now I don't travel as much as I
                    used to, but in the last ten years, I've met some labor attach�s here and there
                    who I thought could have been commercial attach�s. They could have been
                    anything. They were nice people. They would go out of their way to make
                    appointments for me and the usual courtesies that a government officials gives,
                    but I didn't feel they had the. . .</p>

                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Feel for the labor movements, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But without making excuses for the government, the problem
                        is they have to cut back on personnel and, therefore, they generally get
                        people who can operate in other areas. What do you think is the relevance of
                        a trade union background in determining who should be assigned as a labor
                        attach�? Is it good or bad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Well, I speak as an outsider. I think it's essential. If he is going to
                    relate intelligently to other trade unionists, it seems to me it would be very
                    helpful, if not essential, to have some background or some experience — a common
                    language, a common understanding of the situation. That's not to say that the
                    exceptional person couldn't come along who could do it just as well or better
                    without that background.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I've thought about it often in connection with quite another subject, and that's
                    on the reporting of labor and the reporting of religion. I deal with both of
                    those subjects. I find many reporters totally unprepared for the assignment —
                    totally unprepared. I've been at labor conventions where you can't find the
                    press table any more, there are so few of them around, and they obviously don't
                    have any great background. I've dealt with a number of reporters on religious
                    matters where their ignorance was just appalling. Now there are many reasons for
                    that. Newspapers have limited staff and limited money and so forth. But it's
                    just appalling at times. They ask questions that anybody could find out
                    [answers] by looking [them up] in an ordinary encyclopedia or handbook. So, on
                    your question, my own feeling is that it's very essential to have somebody with
                    some labor background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you react to a comment made occasionally that a
                        trade union background can b— and it sometimes is — so important to a person
                        that he begins taking sides within the trade union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Yes. Well, let me modify what I said. I don't mean necessarily that they
                    had to be a trade unionist but someone with a knowledge of the trade union
                    movement. Many of the labor attach�s were not trade unionists, but they had some
                    feel for the subject. in the sense that Louis Stark did as a reporter. He was
                    not a trade unionist, but he understood the trade union movement. That's what I
                    mean. I didn't mean that he had to come from the trade union movement, because
                    for the reason you just gave, that could lead him into a political. . .</p>

                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Not necessarily. But that's what I meant, not that he come from the
                    trade union movement, but that he have some feel for it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: It seems to me it would be something like sending somebody to cover the
                    Vatican and he had no knowledge of the Catholic religion, no background. You
                    know what's going to happen.</p>
                <p>In the first session of Vatican II, — I don't remember his name now, I'm sorry to
                    say. — the best reporter, in my opinion, and there were many reporters there,
                    was a Jewish reporter from The New York Times. He took a year off before he came
                    to Rome, to prepare for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's The New York Times, which gave him a year off.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>HIGGINS: Well, yes. I forget his name now, but he was always a splendid reporter.
                    He died after the first session. A splendid reporter. But it was obvious, he
                    knew what he was doing, while some of the others were just hit and miss or
                    picking up gossip. He had made a serious study of what the issues were. His
                    questions at the press conferences were always right on target. That's what I
                    meant by saying the labor attach� should have that kind of understanding, [i.e.]
                    some knowledge of the history of the movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was involved in training labor attach�s for service
                        abroad, beginning with some of the early ones, and later on, at one point we
                        had them in training for a year, like you said The New York Times did. Now
                        it's down to a six week summer's course, and they're trying to cut back. Do
                        you have any suggestions as to what sort of training labor attach�s should
                        get?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Well, I'm speaking off the top of my head, because I know nothing about
                    it. I would say they should be immersed in as much as you can be in labor
                    history, so they have some context in which to understand labor. [This should
                    include] not only American labor history but the labor history of the countries
                    to which they might be sent, and general European and Latin American labor
                    history. Otherwise, they are flying blind it seems to me.I think that's one of
                    the real problems in our own culture in the United States. So few people have
                    any knowledge of labor history, but they have strong opinions, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: They know nothing about the history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have included, even within a six-week training period,
                        the concept of having an assignment with a trade union just to see how it
                        operates at the local level. Unfortunately, we've had to cut that down
                        considerably. I felt it was important. My successors, who are teaching it
                        now, feel it's important. What do you think? Some people who opposed it
                        said, “Well, you know, they're not going to go into an American trade union.
                        They're going to go into a foreign one.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>HIGGINS: But still, they need some feel for how a union operates. The other
                    subject, but it's much more difficult to do and especially with limited time, is
                    some, for lack of a better word, I'll call it “cultural anthropology.” [Labor
                    attach�s need to] know something about cultures which are different from our
                    own, because that's going to affect the trade union movement. It is quite
                    understandable to me why there's a different attitude towards trade unions in
                    Latin America than there is in Chicago. Those are totally different cultures. As
                    I said earlier in another context, one of the objections that I heard when I
                    first went to Europe on the part of some Europeans was that Americans were so
                    narrow in their own understanding of trade unionism that they couldn't conceive
                    of anything being different and couldn't understand why anyone would even think
                    of having a separate trade union movement from the mainstream movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know you claim your knowledge is very superficial, but
                        to the extent that you're willing to comment, what about the American trade
                        unionists who operated abroad? Brown, Lovestone, Reuther, etcetera? Any
                        observations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Well, I have observations, but they are superficial. I never had any
                    direct contact with Brown, Lovestone, or Reuther in the international field. I
                    knew them of course. I met them. I was always somewhat bewildered by the utter
                    secrecy of Jay [Lovestone]. That I didn't understand at all. I had no personal
                    dealings on labor matters in Europe, or anywhere else with either Lovestone or
                    Brown or Vic Reuther. I said I was bewildered by the secrecy that always
                    surrounded Jay [Lovestone]. I used to meet him occasionally at labor
                    conventions. I had no idea what he was up to really except by hearsay. Brown, I
                    knew in general what he was doing, but not in detail. And Victor, I had no
                    contact with him on international affairs. I don't want to be unfair to Victor,
                    but I sometimes had the impression that they had Victor in Europe to get him out
                    of Detroit, but I don't know whether that's true or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have anything to do with the UAW, by the way,
                        before you went on the [UAW internal disputes] review board?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Oh, yes. Not officially, but I had many, many contacts. I have been at
                    every UAW convention for fifty years. So, I knew them at that level personally.
                    That's why they asked me to go on the board, I assume, because I knew them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as for the international activities to the American
                        unions, the secrecy of [some of] their operations was, of course, because
                        some of the funds that they were using were, according to revelations later
                        on, American Government funds coming from the CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Yes. Well, I always suspected that, but Jay, I think, was by temperament
                    conspiratorially secret.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that's true. Did you get any feeling as to the
                        effectiveness of those international operations, at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: No, I didn't. Not in any direct way. What I hear and read and that would
                    be all, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Italy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Well, Italy. My original dealings were with Tom Lane, and he was as
                    mysterious as Jay Lovestone, the Delphic Oracle, you know. You never quite knew
                    what Tom was saying. I liked him very much. As a matter of fact, I preached at
                    his funeral many, many years ago now. He was a good personal friend, but I never
                    really was sure what Tom was doing. He had that curious way of talking, where he
                    kind of talked in symbols and he used his hands a lot. I had no real personal
                    experience with what he was doing in the internal trade union [situation in
                    Italy]. I knew he was a strong defender of Pastore, and talked about him a great
                    deal, but I never had much personal contact with him. But I always thought it
                    difficult to find out what Tom was really saying. There was a certain mystery
                    about it.</p>
                <p>I remember two Italian priests, who later became bishops, came to the United
                    States after the Vatican Council. I had known them in the Council. So, I
                    thought, well, as long as they're in Washington, — They were both interested in
                    social matters. — I'll take them down to see Tom in the Labor Department. It was
                    an utter waste of time. Tom spoke half Italian, half English, and mostly with
                    his hands. They didn't know what he was talking about. It was the curious manner
                    that he had. But he was a good friend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any comments to make on the decision of the
                        U.S. Government and the decision of the U.S. trade union movement to support
                        Pastore, and not to cooperate with the socialist-oriented UIL at that time?
                        It was a decision which the American government people, Lane and Bruce
                        Millen, had different views on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>HIGGINS: Yes. I just assumed, without knowing anything about it, that it was part
                    of the Cold War atmosphere. Everything fitted into that one heading, but I
                    wasn't involved in it, and I wasn't greatly surprised. We were supporting
                    anything that was anti-Communist and they figured Pastore, I suppose, would be
                    more reliable. But I don't know. I met the UIL people and the Pastore people,
                    but didn't know them well.</p>
                <p>Going back to an earlier period, I will tell you a story about Dubinsky.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Maybe I've told you before. I ran into him in a hotel lobby in Rome. He
                    was smoking a huge cigar. He said, “You should have been with me this morning,
                    Father.” I said, “Where were you this morning?” He said, “I had an audience with
                    the Pope.” This would have been Pius the XII, in the anti-Communist period.
                    “Well,” I said, “there are two reasons I could never get an audience with the
                    Pope. I'm not Jewish and I'm not a labor leader.” But I said, “Since you had an
                    audience, what did you talk about?” He said, “I said, 'Holy Father, you did a
                    great job in those elections.'”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a fascinating person, Dubinsky. I think I may have
                        mentioned to you that I had lunch, the other day, with Mazur and Gus Tyler,
                        who is writing a history of the ILGWU. (International Ladies' Garment
                        Workers' Union) They both agreed to be interviewed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, any other countries in which you had observations
                        about the work of the government? Frankly, with respect to Italy, there were
                        two sides within the government; one of which was not quite as concentrated
                        on the Pastore situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: I never got that involved in any of the countries actually. What I would
                    do is, if I went to Paris, for example, I would find out who was the Labor
                    Attach� and would go over and see him, have a drink with him, or a cup of
                    coffee, and find out what I could learn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Asia? Any comments? Did you go there, at all?
                        The Catholics, as you know, are very active.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: In more recent years, I've been to Asia but not at that time.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, don't restrict it to the old times. What about — I
                        don't know the names of the fellows in Korea and Japan. Did you have
                        anything to do with them? Some of them are doing remarkable work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: I don't recall whether I met the Labor Attach�s in Korea and Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I'm talking about the priests operating there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Oh, I know some of the priests. Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In educational work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Oh, yes. I know a number of the priests. The one that I correspond with
                    most frequently is in Taiwan. Do you remember when the four Jesuits were killed
                    down in Salvador?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: The brother of one of those men is in charge of the Rerum Novarum
                    Institute in Taiwan, Jose Ellacuria, a Jesuit from the Basque country, like his
                    brother. The Rerum Novarum Institute is an educational institute for workers
                    pushing as far as they can go for free trade unions. About three years ago,
                    Father Ellacuria was expelled from the country. He finally got back in. But
                    another priest, an Irish priest not of his order, who was more vocal, I guess,
                    and more polemical, they kicked him out for good. They called him into the
                    headquarters of the police. He brought two of his lay assistants with him and
                    they waited outside, and when he didn't come out after an hour or so, they got
                    worried and they called the bishop. The bishop checked, and he had never even
                    sat down. They took him out the back door, put him on an airplane, and sent him
                    to London. He never got back in. Ellacuria is back in. I suppose he was told to
                    cool it a bit. A good man. Just quietly trying to educate workers towards free
                    trade unions.</p>
                <p>I knew some men in Korea, a Maryknoll priests and Colombians who worked with the
                    workers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that Ballou or is that Japan?</hi>

                <p>HIGGINS: No, that one, I don't know. In Hong Kong, I knew some.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Well, they do educational work directly for workers too. I spoke in
                    Korea, this is ten years ago now, in all of the Catholic seminaries. At that
                    time there were four and they were crowded with vocations coming out their ears.
                    At one of them, I remember the rector of the seminary, who spoke English
                    reasonably well, said when we were going into the meeting, “Father, you might as
                    well take it for granted that there will be somebody here tonight spying on you.
                    But,” he said, “Don't let that worry you. We live under that system.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Well, I've never been to India, so I haven't any idea what the situation
                    there is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I mean: Is there the allegation in any of the
                        countries that you have been in about proselytizing as against simply
                        educating about labor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Oh, you mean in the labor schools and in the labor education
                    program?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: No, I never heard that. I don't believe it of the people I know. I think
                    they were in there because they believed the workers ought to have free trade
                    unions. I think that's a suspicion that people might have, but I never saw it. I
                    might add, it's a very dangerous way of proselytizing. Very dangerous.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the allegation in India. The government was very
                        uncomfortable with the wonderful activities [going on there].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Well, you knew these men; I didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. I knew them very well and saw no evidence of
                        proselytizing except that, for the untouchable group and for the nativist
                        (tribal) groups, it was a self-defense device to become a Catholic, if they
                        chose to do so, but I saw no evidence of that, because by becoming a
                        Catholic, you then were forgiven by society for having been. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Yes, I can see that. Well, I must say that in all the time I've been in
                    this field, for the men that I know who were working with workers, that charge
                    would not be true either in this country or in overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, I have a strong feeling that that's not true
                        in India either; and we defended them against those charges because many of
                        them were Americans, whose status would have been in question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there was always the problem every time. Imagine a man
                        spending thirty years at the Xavier Institute and then he has to get new
                        papers to stay on and then there's always the charge, somebody in your class
                        claims. . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: They can kick you out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and there is the danger of being kicked out. And that
                        is their whole life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: One of the Maryknollers, who was not in labor education in Korea, told
                    me an interesting story. He was, I think, attached to the bishop's office. He
                    said, “I got so tired of having my phone tapped and having these people come
                    around and interrogate me, that I thought I'd take them on. So,” he said, “one
                    day the usual agent came by and he wanted to check on me. And I said to him,
                    'You know, Mr. Kuhn or King, we've been meeting now for two or three years. You
                    keep coming in here, but I don't think you know where I come from. So, if you'll
                    just sit back, I'm going to give you a history of my church.' “ So, he said, “I
                    took him from Moses. By the time,” he said, “I got up to the Middle Ages, he was
                    so tired, he wanted to stop. But, 'Oh, no, no,' I said, 'I'm just getting
                    started.' “ He said that was the last time that guy ever bothered him.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, do you have any final words? We're coming close to
                        your next appointment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: No, I must apologize for my memory being so vague. The problem is that I
                    really didn't have that much direct involvement. My trips to Europe were rather
                    haphazard and my contacts intermittent. It wasn't as though I were studying
                    France or studying Italy or studying Holland. I have impressions. That's all.
                    But I have very favorable impressions of the Labor Attach� Corps in those days,
                    very favorable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. Well, thank you very much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: I thought [the Labor Attach� Corps] was an extremely important
                    innovation, and not only are the Americans, I knew a number of labor attach�s
                    from other countries, whom I used to meet around town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They have a few here, now. Well, thanks, very much. It
                        will take me a little time to clear up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: Sure. I'm going away all next week to the annual Christian-Jewish
                    dialogue in Tulsa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Representing which group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: I represent myself. No, I'm really, in this case, I'll be representing
                    the U.S. Catholic Conference. I'm the Chairman of their Advisory Committee on
                    that subject. And then, I'm going to Philadelphia for a labor meeting and I'm
                    going to Rome for a week, for a very interesting meeting [with] thirty people
                    from around the world on the Church and workers. What the agenda is, I don't
                    know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, that is a subject which, in the old days, we would
                        have our Labor Attach� cover in some way. Now a days, with all the division
                        of work of the Labor Attach�, they cannot afford to do that. Well, thank you
                        very, very much. We'll transcribe this as soon as we can and give it to you.
                        Well, you'll also be asked to signed a release, so that the transcript can
                        be used.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HIGGINS: No problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you very much.</hi>
