                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is August 15, the Ides of August, 1996. This an
                        interview with Edward Hurwitz which is being done on behalf of the
                        Association for Diplomatic Studies and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I wonder if you could tell me a bit about when and where you were born and
                    something about your family?</p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I was born in New York City in March 1931. My family was rather typical
                    Jewish middle class New York City types. My father was the son of a
                    Russian/Jewish immigrant. My mother, herself, was an immigrant coming here at
                    the age of three.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did your grandfather come over here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: He came from Lithuania, which was then part of Russia, in 1885, or
                    something like that. He was escaping what was then obligatory military service
                    of 25 years for rural Jews. He left his family at the age of 16, never saw them
                    again, and walked across Germany. He ended up in Brooklyn and over the years was
                    able to open up a grocery store there. He did reasonably well. My father then
                    became for a brief period a coffee salesman around New York having had that
                    grocery background. He went to Boys High in Brooklyn, but didn't graduate, which
                    was often the case. He met my mother, whose father owned a grocery store, while
                    selling coffee on that route. She at the age of three had come from Romania in
                    1903. This is a rather typical story of Jewish immigration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were born in 1931, a period of high depression.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: My father gave up the coffee business and opened up a hardware store in
                    Queens, New York, in 1922 and gradually the business improved. It may well be
                    that the depression somewhat helped that business because he was selling things
                    that the small homeowners, who were beginning to populate that area, wanted,
                    like nails, screws, etc. You didn't call up the contractor to fix your sink, you
                    did it yourself. So, the business did rather well. In fact, during the
                    depression, he not only held his own but probably did better than most. So, the
                    family was quite middle class. We didn't really suffer during the
                    depression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I went to Jamaica High School in Queens. Then I won one of the New York
                    state scholarships and went to Cornell, entering in 1948. I had always had a
                    great interest in foreign affairs. I recall at eight or nine on the playground
                    in my elementary school telling the kids, I suppose rather pedantically, that I
                    was very interested in foreign languages and did they know for example that the
                    word lorry meant truck or that cinema meant movie. So, I was sort of moving in
                    that direction already, even though my background was thoroughly parochial New
                    York City.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did World War II have an impact on that interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, yes. During World War II I remember collecting newspapers. I had
                    them many, many years later. It is probably true that kids of that era,
                    partially because of the war, partially because of the way tradition, history
                    and family was passed along by word of mouth, you didn't have TV of course in
                    those days, the past was something that was interesting. I read historical
                    novels. World War II meant that you knew as a child where Bosnia was, where
                    Guadalcanal was, where the Marianas were, places in the Pacific, where Japan
                    was. Today I understand you can ask kids where various places are and they don't
                    know. But, you knew then, it was part of your life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including Canada, I understand, sometimes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: So, all of us in elementary school were very much clued into things.
                    They were largely related to war, but they stuck with you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the same experience. What were you taking at
                        Cornell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I took government. They didn't call it political science at that time.
                    They had a very good department. I graduated from Cornell in 1952.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any information while you were in Cornell
                        about the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, I was very interested in the State Department, but I must say right
                    away, as you probably know, at that time, unless you were fairly upper class the
                    idea of going to Europe was unheard of. Today kids in high school might spend a
                    summer in France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Europe was devastated pretty much too so it was not
                        the greatest place to visit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: But, nevertheless, you studied and you had this interest and you
                    followed what was going on. In 1952 I was facing, as a lot of us were at this
                    time, the question of being drafted for the Korea War as well as “what are you
                    going to do?” There were plenty of opportunities to work for the government.
                    CIA, then a new outfit, I recall was coming around and recruiting. The Foreign
                    Service was considered the creme de la creme. Because of a blood pressure
                    problem I was declared 4F, which in a sense devastated me. I was the kind of
                    coward that feared being marked as being different. And, as you recall, 4F
                    during World War II was pejorative. Not that I was a hero, but I would rather
                    have faced going to Korea than seeing my friends go off.</p>
                <p>So, what I did do was pass the junior management program, which was a civil
                    service job somewhat similar to the Presidential Intern thing now. I came down
                    to Washington in 1952 and got a job with the State Department, the part of it
                    that was then the International Information Administration (IIA), which was a
                    forerunner of USIA before it split off from the Department. It was interesting.
                    I was doing congressional correspondence for that organization, which was
                    important at the time being the height of the McCarthy era, the height of
                    McCarthy's attacks on VOA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little bit about the sort of correspondence you got
                        in and the pressures on you re how you answered these things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I was 21 plus and very young and didn't have much responsibility. It was
                    a question of the usual congressional correspondence. Why do we have such a
                    program? Why are we doing this? Can you do something for my constituent? I
                    wouldn't say there were pressures on me, I just did my job.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I came down in September, 1952 to take that job and stayed for a few days at the
                    YMCA on G Street for $3. I had taken a train down from Ithaca and then took the
                    trolley from Union Station. It was a different city at that time. But, in early
                    1953 I began to think I would take another swat at seeing if I could overcome
                    this 4F business. So, I reapplied at a different draft board. My first draft
                    board was in New York. This time I applied down here as a Washington resident,
                    and did pass the physical and was inducted here and went into the army. This
                    made me feel a lot better that I was one of the guys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the army from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: From May, 1953 to May, 1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you serve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I was lucky enough to get into heavy weapons training at Camp
                    Breckinridge, Kentucky. I was then selected for what was known then as the CIC,
                    Counter Intelligence Corps, because I was a college graduate and knew Russian at
                    the time to a certain extent having studied it at Cornell. I went into the CIC
                    school, which was at Fort Holzbird, Maryland and had a four or five months
                    course. CIC was a lot of interrogation. It was counterintelligence and also
                    helping out the military investigations with issues which could have involved
                    intelligence. I was then sent to Japan and spent a year in Tokyo with the CIC.
                    Because I knew some Russian at the time, they assigned me a unit that followed
                    the activities of the Soviet mission in Tokyo. The Soviets had not yet set up an
                    embassy. I believe at that time they had not yet signed a peace treaty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure they ever have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: They later had an embassy and I'm not sure what happened afterwards. The
                    big problem with the Soviets there, of course, was espionage. The second issue
                    was that the Soviets had mounted a very energetic drive to bring back to the
                    Soviet Union the younger people whose parents had fled the Soviet Union in 1917.
                    Most people went west to Paris, the more well to do, the less well to do by and
                    large went east to Harbin, China, Tientsin, China. And then when the communist
                    Chinese came in in 1947, a lot of these people picked up stakes and went to
                    Japan, after the war. So, by the time I got to Japan in 1954 in the army, there
                    were a lot of Russians there. The younger ones had never lived in Russia. So,
                    there were a large group of Russians there, many who spoke Japanese and English.
                    The Soviets were trying to lure these people back to the Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>We were new at the counter intelligence game and it was sort of a strange
                    operation and we really didn't know what we were doing. For example, I was 23
                    years old at the time and told that a Soviet visitor was coming who had served
                    in the Soviet mission before. He was staying at such and such a hotel and I
                    should see if I could get him to defect. But, it was an interesting and exciting
                    time. My Russian improved. And, then my tour was up and I was sent back to the
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it still the occupation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: No, the Japanese had adopted a constitution. You couldn't call it an
                    occupation, although our troops were there in great numbers. But, the government
                    had been turned over to the Japanese by that time.</p>
                <p>I left the army in 1955 and then in the fall of that year I enrolled in the
                    Harvard Russian Institute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had the GI Bill by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, I used that. It was to be a two year course leading to an MA. Along
                    the way I became a little concerned...what would I do, why would I stay two
                    years to get an MA, usually an MA is one year? What I really would like to do
                    was join the Foreign Service and the MA isn't going to help me that much in the
                    Foreign Service. I took the Foreign Service exam after the first semester in
                    December, 1955 and passed it. I spent the next semester still at Harvard and
                    then got the call from the Foreign Service that indeed I could come down and
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember anything about what you were asked in the
                        oral exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: The oral exam was totally different. The written exam was also
                    different. There was a very big language portion which I took in Russian and did
                    very well on it. The oral exam, as I recall, was up in Boston and there was a
                    panel of what seemed to me to be old Foreign Service officers. I was alone there
                    and they were just throwing questions at me. They were heavily weighted toward
                    what did I know, substantive questions, not how I would react. Nowadays you are
                    all play acting. But then it was how quick were you on issues and how deep was
                    your knowledge. It was what they could discern about your real interests in the
                    Foreign Service from what you knew, had studied and concerns were. It was not
                    hypothetical situations. One can argue both ways what is the best type of
                    exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you came into the Foreign Service when? HURWITZ: In
                        September, 1956.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Will you describe a little bit the composition of your
                        class and a little about the training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: We went into our A100 course and FSI in those days was a red brick
                    apartment, which today I think would occupy the space around where at New State
                    in the front the flag pole on the right is. The class was some 30-35 people. A
                    considerable number of women, although it was all white. A little more than half
                    of the men were veterans of one kind or another. The oldest member was 35, a
                    navy officer who had been in World War II. A lot of them were from eastern ivy
                    league schools. The age was much younger than today. I was 25. Very few people
                    had had prior work experience, coming directly from school, graduate school or
                    the military. They all regarded the Foreign Service as a career. It was not
                    something I heard later in B/EX, “Well, I would like to try it, try something
                    new.” Very few people, as was the case with myself, had traveled around a lot.
                    Nowadays you take off for a couple of years, perhaps, and do a lot of
                    traveling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any impression of the State Department as an
                        organization at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, it seemed to me, through the eyes of a rather young person, to be
                    rather August. You were very impressed with what you saw. At that time there
                    seemed to be giants, names that you knew, like Dean Acheson, although he was no
                    longer Secretary, John Foster Dulles, George Kennan. These were names that you
                    had known from just knowing things the way kids knew more things in those days,
                    at least kids of people I knew. So, it seemed like a very big deal. It didn't
                    feel like just another civil service job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the end of the A100 course they have this time when
                        they read out where you are assigned. How did it work out for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I was assigned to INR and for me it turned out to be a good job,
                    although I would have preferred to have gone overseas. But, in those days two
                    elements of the assignment process were just taken for granted: 1) you had no
                    real choice, although you could express a choice, and 2) nobody had any idea
                    that they might be assigned to anything other than political work. It was taken
                    for granted that this is what you came into the Foreign Service for and nobody
                    was going to say you were going to be doing consular work or admin or GSO. There
                    was no such thing as that cone business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in INR from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: I was in INR from the end of my A100 course, which was something like
                    February 1957 until May 1958. In May, 1958, for me to have gone to Moscow would
                    have been going to heaven.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk first about INR. What were you doing in
                        INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I was in a unit that dealt with Soviet internal affairs and my field was
                    Soviet economics. There were others doing it, a lot of holdovers from OSS
                    people, Russian emigres—Uber Richter did agriculture, Paul Gecker, Walt Pinter,
                    who later went on to Cornell University and is still there as a professor of
                    history. In the office doing external affairs was Jack Matlock, Sol Polansky,
                    who later went on to be ambassador in Bulgaria. Hal Sonnenfeldt and Boris
                    Klosson were in the office. So, it was old Russian or Eastern European
                    hands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Russian internal developments in 1957/58 were obviously a
                        matter of great interest to the United States but in a way very difficult to
                        unravel. You couldn't go out and run polls. Where were you getting your
                        information?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: If I recall correctly, it was largely FBIS, Pravda. There was also an
                    output from CIA that we looked at, but I can't recall exactly what it was. It
                    was largely open sources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: FBIS being the open monitoring service which is actually
                        published and available to anyone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: And, of course, there was embassy reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On embassy reporting, what was your impression of the
                        reports that were coming out of there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I was there a short time and really can't recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we look upon the situation inside the Soviet Union
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, this was the time of the anti-party group when Khrushchev was
                    consolidating his position. When he first came in in 1953 after Stalin's death
                    he was sort of sharing power with Malenkov and Bulganin. He later dispensed with
                    them. How things were settling down in the wake of Stalin's death in March of
                    1953 was a major issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time was there much talk about the various
                        nationalities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: No, that really came later. The question of the nationalities,
                    especially in the Baltic area, was always kept alive by the various Baltic
                    communities here, but other issues, no. There might be some efforts to bring to
                    the attention of the government the emigre exposes. But, a lot of emigres had
                    been written off as being super anti-communist. People who had been communist
                    and later discovered the truth, or what they said was the truth. So, you really
                    couldn't evaluate it. It turns out that a lot of it was actually true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think many of us had this impression because these
                        were not very impressive people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After INR, in 1958 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: In 1958 Llewellyn Thompson had just recently arrived in Moscow and he
                    wanted a staff aide. Now, prior to me, not acting as staff aide, but living in
                    the residence, Spaso, was a bachelor officer who had come from Indonesia. He had
                    a job in the embassy but because of the housing shortage and Spaso was a big
                    rambling house, he lived there. Well, Thompson wanted to have a staff aide who
                    would actually live in the residence and also take care of the ordering of his
                    food from commissaries in Frankfurt and deal with the household staff, do his
                    accounts, etc. So, I went out and considered it one of my greatest opportunities
                    in my life, and lived in Spaso.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>It is a curious story, though. Once I got out there, Thompson really didn't give
                    me anything to do particularly. At one point, Mrs. Thompson, Jane Thompson, was
                    saying that “Tommy, Ed has to have an office right here at Spaso and I will work
                    with him on a daily basis.” Thompson said, “Oh, no, no, he has to come to the
                    embassy every day.” So, I went to the embassy every day and Thompson gave me his
                    correspondence. He got lots of letters from the States. The Soviet Union was
                    just opening up to tourism, etc. He would throw these to me and I would answer
                    them. He was very anxious, correctly so, that these letters be answered politely
                    and with as much information as could be given to the writer. I remember one
                    case, for example, where he got a letter from a kid who was collecting soil from
                    around the world. He wanted some Moscow dirt. Already becoming an adept
                    bureaucrat, I said, “Okay, I will assign this letter to be answered by the
                    agricultural attach�.” Well, he let it sit until finally what happened was that
                    the kid getting no answer from the American embassy in Moscow, wrote a letter to
                    the Soviet embassy in Washington which dutifully sent the kid some dirt.
                    Probably they went out in the back garden of the Soviet embassy in Washington
                    and dug up some dirt and sent it to him, but at least they responded to him. We
                    found out about it because the kid's congressman wrote to the State Department
                    saying, “See, our American embassy doesn't help us out, but the Soviet embassy
                    did.” Thompson was a little annoyed at that. This was precisely what he was
                    trying to avoid with these letters.</p>
                <p>So, I did that sort of thing. I did deal with the staff. But, still it took up
                    only a little of my time. The rest of my time I was spending very fruitfully
                    going around to lectures, but that is another story. It turns out the reason
                    Thompson didn't give me anything to do was very curious. We had an inspection,
                    Ed Gullion was the inspector. He later became ambassador to Vietnam. Gullion
                    brought in all the political type officers and staff aide into his office, one
                    by one. When my turn came he said, “Sit down Ed. I have always wanted to see one
                    of you.” “One of me? What do you mean?” He said, “I have always wanted to see an
                    FSO who was a member of the CIA.” I said, “But, I am not a member of the CIA. I
                    am an honest FSO.” He said, “Well, the ambassador thinks you are. Let me go back
                    and check.” There were secret files apparently and it turned out I was an FSO.
                    But, Thompson thought because he wanted a single officer and they sent out a
                    Russian speaker that I was really full time CIA. We settled that, of course, and
                    from then on I did a lot more work in the residence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your perspective, how did Llewellyn Thompson operate
                        in the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Thompson was very self-contained. He wasn't a very articulate guy. He
                    played a lot of things close to the chest. But, he had long experience there
                    during the war. He knew a lot of people. He was able to get along with the
                    Soviet leadership. And, this was a time when Khrushchev would show up
                    occasionally at the embassy, Khrushchev would deal with the diplomats, other
                    Politburo members would come to the Fourth of July. It was a totally different
                    atmosphere from either before or after during the Brezhnev period. So, we saw a
                    lot of the Soviet leadership.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you went around to lectures, etc. What were you
                        getting out of these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: There always had been during all my tours in the Soviet Union, a system
                    of lectures. Some were completely open to the public, some were not publicized.
                    I was an inveterate walker, walking the city endlessly and would see notices on
                    clubs, writers club, etc. about lectures on political, cultural subjects and
                    would go. My Russian by then was getting very good and in short sentences (”I
                    want a ticket to get in” or “What time is it?”) they couldn't distinguish me
                    from maybe a Latvian or someone like that, so I got into a lot of these things.
                    The lectures might be straight party line, but the questions often were
                    incredibly revealing about how people felt, their complaints, their living
                    conditions. People would say things you would never see in the press. Why are so
                    many people denied housing? I have been living in a hovel in a basement and
                    nobody is interested in my welfare, I can't get any food. Things that were
                    diametrically opposed to what you would be reading in the Soviet press.</p>
                <p>I recall one that was very revealing and we used it quite a bit. I heard a
                    lecturer say point blank at a time when this was not supposed to be known that
                    Castro was a communist. He was getting full support from the Soviets. This was
                    at a time when Castro was trying to force himself off as a home ground
                    revolutionary having nothing to do with the Soviet Union. I remember we got a
                    call from the guy who was then assistant secretary for ARA. I did this
                    throughout my career and turned up a lot of very fascinating stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the Soviet Union this time from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: This was 1958-60.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to take any trips outside of Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, yes. I went to a lot of interesting places. Most of them by train.
                    For example, one of the more interesting trips was to Yakutsk, way up in eastern
                    Siberia. I went to Vilnius. I went to the out of the way places, Kishinev, which
                    is in Moldavia; Kirov, which is in western Siberia and had just opened up. I did
                    an enormous amount of traveling by train.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would a typical trip work? What were you trying to
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: You were just trying to see what was going on. On the typical trip you
                    would go with somebody else, very often a Brit, Canadian, or Australian. We
                    would go to a town and just look around. Go to the market. Go to bookstores and
                    try to buy books that were not on sale elsewhere. We had a very active book
                    buying program but everybody participated. There was a publications procurement
                    officer, but everybody picked up stuff. We would go to restaurants. At that time
                    restaurants were crowded and you were virtually always seated with people who
                    were already at a table. If they felt nobody was listening and they felt you
                    were an American, which was easy for them to determine, they would really open
                    up on what the problems were. So, we were able through these trips into the
                    countryside, where you have to realize that you may have seen this in Visket,
                    but you go 50 kilometers outside of Moscow and you are going back a hundred
                    years in time—people pulling water out of wells with the yokes. Through this we
                    were able to present a picture of the Soviet Union which was totally different
                    than the one that the propaganda machine was trying to purvey and making it
                    clear to what extent the Soviet effort to mount a space program or to what
                    extent the emphasis on military development was really costing the Soviet Union
                    in economic terms, an enormous amount.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems with the KGB during these
                        trips?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. I was young and silly, I think, my first tour. Rather early on I
                    began to notice the same people around. Someone I had noticed in a crowd last
                    week was there again. So, I began to play a few games with them, which was a big
                    mistake. For example, going down into the subway and then waiting until the last
                    minute to board a train to try to avoid them. I should have realized that from
                    their standpoint that is not a game, that it appears suspicious or malicious.
                    So, I had a few run ins. They got annoyed and began to follow very closely.
                    During my second tour I didn't do that at all and I can't say I wasn't followed
                    all the time. When you went outside of Moscow you would be followed. The local
                    KGB or police were always much more enthusiastic and concerned about having
                    something happen on their turf.</p>

                <p>HURWITZ: The only real incident I ever had was in 1970 when the Jewish Defense
                    League in New York was really being very nasty with Soviet diplomats and
                    families. It was really scurrilous what they were doing—spitting at wives, etc.
                    So, one day I was taking my morning run in January and as I was running around
                    the area where I lived a car came up onto the sidewalk where I was running and a
                    guy got out blocking my way. He said, “Hurwitz, some day you are going to fall
                    off the platform of the subway or walking under a building and a brick is going
                    to fall from the top of the house.” From that day on for two weeks, it was lock
                    step. If I went into a bookstore and stood in front of a shelf, there was a guy
                    at my shoulder. They never touched me. They were very disciplined. This went on
                    for two weeks and then it ended with a crescendo and stopped. The crescendo was
                    that I was in a car with my wife coming back from a reception and there was the
                    follow car which was right on my bumper. I stopped for a light, they stopped and
                    somebody got out (I didn't see him) and went up to the back window and smashed
                    it in. Then it stopped. Sol Polansky was in the embassy at the time and also
                    shared a little bit of that. They may have singled us out. But, their purpose in
                    doing this was from their standpoint perfectly logical and reasonable. We kept
                    telling them in New York, for example, “Look, this is New York City jurisdiction
                    and we can't do anything about it. We have no control over the courts.” They
                    couldn't understand this and they turned out to be right because in the wake of
                    all this what happened after they started harassing our people we had some laws
                    passed protecting diplomats.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a very difficult period for you. But, back to the
                        time you were there first, 1958-60. You were there during the U2 time. How
                        did that work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I got married in Moscow to the daughter of the Norwegian ambassador. She
                    came in 1958, we met and got married in 1960. Our plan had been to go out of the
                    country, to Vienna for a honeymoon. I think those plans were interfered with by
                    the prospective visit of Eisenhower. In fact, the Soviets were building a golf
                    course some place for him. But, then the U2 stopped the visit. We couldn't
                    resuscitate the Vienna trip at that point. I was leaving pretty shortly. Yes,
                    the U2 was a big deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about demonstrations against the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Demonstrations were the order of the day depending on the issue. In
                    July, 1958 there was a huge demonstration outside the embassy in connection with
                    our having landed troops in Lebanon. It was the typical well organized
                    demonstration, by the numbers, with the very carefully done placards saying
                    “Hands Off Lebanon” and that sort of thing. There is an extraordinarily wide,
                    broad street in front of the embassy, Tchaikovsky Street, and it was just solid
                    with people. There was the throwing of ink wells, breaking of windows and that
                    sort of stuff. But, here again, throughout all of this I was never really
                    concerned about my safety vis-a-vis these goons, as we called them, or the
                    demonstrators. It was all thoroughly orchestrated and controlled and almost
                    nobody had any real spleen. The average person, whether organized to do this or
                    not, really liked the United States. That is the strange part of it. So many
                    conversations that I had made that clear. So many people, especially the older
                    people, were appreciative for what the United States had done. So many people
                    would talk about “I remember the canned ham, spam, and the jeep”, etc. Even
                    during the darkest days of the Cold War, the United States was still loved by
                    the average Soviet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get out into the crowds during these
                        demonstrations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: At that particular one, the Lebanon one, I had been at the ambassador's
                    residence, which is about a fifteen minute walk from the embassy, for lunch. The
                    demonstration had begun while I was having lunch there and the street was
                    filled. I later went back and stood around the fringes of the crowd, without,
                    again, the slightest bit of concern for my personal safety. It is not as if you
                    are in a Pakistani demonstration or something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impression during the time you were there of
                        Khrushchev?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Khrushchev was considered a wily, but very unorthodox by Soviet
                    standards, person. An earthy, peasant type, who was interested in not having a
                    real confrontation with the United States. He was somebody who Thompson could
                    talk to. He came to the embassy. He talked to any number of American visitors of
                    the Rockefeller type. He was interested even at that time in seeking some kind
                    of common arrangement to avoid confrontation. It was a totally different
                    atmosphere from Stalin and from what came later with Brezhnev. It was an
                    “otopel”, a thaw from what had gone on before. It was a period when Solzhenitsyn
                    was being published and the theater was opening up. A period of blossoming of
                    something that had been suppressed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling that sort of on the cultural side
                        things were more open?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, by all means. We had our first contingent of IREX students. We had
                    the Sol Hurok exchanges. We had “Porgy and Bess” coming there. You know, when I
                    was there for a young Foreign Service officer, it was absolutely...I was in
                    seventh heaven. We had Adlai Stevenson, Eleanor Roosevelt, Carl Sandburg,
                    Saroyan, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Gary Cooper and Edward G. Robinson. All
                    of these were opportunities for enormous outpouring of interest on the part of
                    Russians. It was a very active and interesting time. Perhaps the most
                    influential, the most striking evidence of this was a triumph of USIA and US
                    policy initiative there, the US exhibition in 1959. The big kitchen debate
                    venue. This was really a masterpiece because it was all geared to American
                    consumer items. Things that blew the Soviets' minds. It was done in a very
                    effective way. There were American hairdressers doing Soviet women. There was a
                    huge book exhibit at which we knew the books would disappear. Some genius in
                    USIA had the idea of having a Yiddish book section which was fantastic. I stood
                    there frequently and watched people gaze up at these books and be almost afraid
                    to touch them. I had many really revealing conversations at that area. I would
                    reach up and pull down books trying to encourage other people to pull them down.
                    They were sort of quaking. As I say, the books disappeared in enormous numbers.
                    It was really a great triumph and opened up people's eyes in the Soviet Union,
                    those who may have believed America is okay if you are rich but for the working
                    person it is no good. They had this theater in the round, a 360 degree film,
                    which even the Soviets would say you couldn't fake. It showed, for example, a
                    Ford plant with the workers leaving the plant at the end of their shift, going
                    out into the parking lot which was a sea of private cars. So, that was a really
                    beautifully executed...</p>

                <p>HURWITZ: I wasn't there at that particular debate. Nixon said a few things later

                    just...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, much so. I was just reading one of the letters I wrote home. We had
                    a number of dances, Mrs. Thompson arranged this, to which ballerinas were
                    invited. I remember writing home that I hoped to be able to dance with Ulanova,
                    who was the queen of Russian ballet. Well, it turns out I danced with somebody
                    else who later became famous. That was something that faded away in time during
                    the Brezhnev years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression whither the Soviet Union at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: There was no inkling on my part that it would come to grief later. That
                    the propaganda was totally just that and the realities were completely
                    different. That there were great dissatisfactions. But, that even at that point
                    they were beginning to live better. They had gone through this period of terror,
                    had gone through the war, deprivations of all kinds, but things were better.
                    Whether they would continue to get better, I didn't really consider. But, even
                    then you knew it was physically an enormously rich country. I had the feeling
                    that the people (and this became clear later) despite everybody saying that they
                    wouldn't work, that the system simply discouraged real work, could be motivated
                    to work and that the average person was against war and really did want peace.
                    The people couldn't really be mobilized to fight against the United States
                    unless they were invaded. So, I think I felt the Soviet Union was not destined
                    to come apart by any means, nor was it destined to rule the world, that neither
                    Khrushchev nor the people in charge were interested in doing that sort of
                    thing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Because I had been in Japan in the army, I was interested in studying
                    Japanese, having been very taken with Japan. My second choice for language
                    training was Korean, to make the Japanese sound really plausible. Well, I was
                    sent to Korean language training, which I'm glad of in retrospect. FSI didn't
                    teach Korean in those days, so I was sent to Yale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long was the period of studying Korean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: It was ten months at Yale. Then in September, 1961, I went to Korea to
                    Yangtze University which had a course basically for American missionaries
                    learning Korean. It was not a good course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember Yangtze University because I was barracked
                        there during the Korean War. I used to monitor the Soviet air force. I had
                        gone to the Army language school to take Russian and that was where we were
                        located. Can you describe an American taking Korean? What are the
                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, the problems were that there were no real text books and very few
                    tapes. The reason I went to Yale was not because Yale had any established
                    academic program in Korean. What Yale was doing was playing host for a crash
                    course for people who were doing just what you were doing with the Soviets, that
                    is monitoring. These air force enlisted men were really focusing on listening to
                    numbers and that sort of thing. When they finished this course, if they were
                    good enough, they would be sent to Korea and go along the fringes of Korea,
                    either up the coast or along the DMZ, listening to North Korean military
                    broadcasts or communications. So, that wasn't really good. I did well in it
                    because I studied hard and the teacher, a Korean, took me aside and worked with
                    me. When I went to Yangtze, I did six months with that group, and then I did six
                    months alone with an instructor.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Right. I joined the embassy in July, 1962, the political section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at Yangtze, one of the preeminent schools
                        of South Korea, were you able to get any feel for the students, the
                        campus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: No. I went to Yangtze in the afternoon. The morning I spent with an
                    older, very interesting, Korean woman, a Methodist laywoman, who had been in
                    jail during the Japanese occupation and was part of the independent movement.
                    She had a little office near where I lived where I went to study. One of her
                    other students at the time was Jim Laney, who was a Methodist missionary at the
                    time and is now ambassador. I studied in the morning with her and in the
                    afternoon I went to Yangtze and was in this course. I had nothing to do with the
                    regular student body at that time. Later, when the student demonstrations
                    against the Japanese treaty in 1964 started, I got a little involved.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I came right on the heels of the Park Chung Hee military takeover. You
                    had the student riots of 1960, which deposed Syngman Rhee and then you had in
                    May, 1961, the Park Chung Hee military takeover. So, the embassy was dealing
                    with a military government, which was not committed to democratic ideals by any
                    means.</p>

                    largely. I stayed there until January, 1966.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little about personalities. What was your
                        impression of how Phil Habib operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Phil had to be every young Foreign Service officer's hero. Phil knew
                    everybody, played cards with the Prime Minister, went hunting with this
                    minister, was constantly on the move. He was a very brilliant guy, hard worker,
                    terribly loyal to his staff, moved by the highest standards of morality and
                    fairness. A good boss in the sense you would write something and he would look
                    at it and say, “Hurwitz, I wouldn't have done it exactly this way, but get it
                    out of here, send it.” He was not a nitpicker. He would back you 100 percent.
                    Really a fine guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: It was Sam Berger when I first got there and then it became Winthrop
                    Brown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your impression, how did Sam Berger get on with
                        Habib?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Very well. The DCM at that time, Magistreti, was sort of cut out. Berger
                    was not really a Korean or Japanese hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He got his real renown for being a labor officer in
                        England where he knew the Labour Party when nobody else did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, and he was close to Governor Harriman. Phil, at one point had also
                    been a labor type. I guess that is how they knew each other. Berger, I think,
                    gave Phil a rather free hand and sort of bypassed Magistreti, who didn't seem to
                    be doing very much. And that continued when Brown came in, with his DCM, Ed
                    Dougherty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came into the political section, how did we look
                        upon the Park Chung Hee government? This was very early on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: The effort was to try to get Park Chung Hee to come around as fast as
                    possible and restore civilian government. To try to make sure he didn't ride
                    roughshod over civil rights or the free press. There was a strong authoritarian
                    bent to them, which was hardly surprising in Korea at that time. As I recall we
                    were trying to get them to reinstitute normal government instead of ruling by
                    military fiat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your particular focus while you were in the
                        political section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: It wasn't really divided up that much. I did deal with the DRP, the
                    government party. Kim Jung-pil was head of the government party. My Korean by
                    that time was pretty good, in fact, at one point, because we didn't really train
                    Korean speakers and we really didn't have the teaching materials, I was probably
                    the best speaker of Korean. So, I dealt a lot with opposition types too who
                    didn't speak English. I dealt with them without an interpreter which was useful.
                    I did a lot of traveling around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the opposition with Kim Dae Jung?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Kim Dae Jung wasn't really a figure at that time. Kim Yong-Sam was the
                    leader of the Democratic Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our impression of the opposition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Not particularly favorable. We dealt with them and tried to give them a
                    little support and encouragement, but they were really not top notch people at
                    the time. Kim Yong-Sam was not very impressive at the time. But, he was long
                    lasting and was there when I went back in 1974-75.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting about Park Chung Hee as far as his
                        effectiveness and how we felt about him as far as our policy was
                        concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I was a pretty low man on the totem pole there. Park was a fact of life.
                    You couldn't say, “Let's deal with somebody else,” he was in there and in
                    control. We didn't try to undermine him in anyway. Dan O'Donohue and Phil may
                    have at some point felt this was dictatorial, but my feeling was that these guys
                    were within the ball park for certainly that part of the world and the
                    opposition was not stamped out. One newspaper DongA Ilbo was pretty darn
                    independent, critical. So, while we tried to soften the rough edges of the Park
                    regime, there was no effort to somehow depose it or go public with strong
                    criticism.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we monitoring the students at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because they had proved to be a force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, they tried to be a force again with something that the United
                    States was very much in favor with and that was the settlement with Japan in
                    1964. It led to a whole series of street demonstrations. The students then, as
                    now, were very, very tough. These are not placard baring students, these are
                    students that arm themselves, throw rocks and fire bombs, etc. I must say the
                    Park regime handled those demonstrations extremely effectively. Only one person
                    was killed, if memory serves me. A number of students commandeered a truck and
                    one of them fell off. But, the students were very destabilizing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Spring was always the time. As I say now, we both heard
                        the same news reports that students are holed up in Yangtze University
                        threatening to blow themselves up if there isn't unification with North
                        Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. And that sort of unification is nonsense. Even if the North would
                    say, “All right, let's unify,” you have real big problems. At one point for the
                    North Koreans to come hat in hand and say, “Let's unify,” that would have been a
                    great propaganda plus for South Korea. They would have welcomed it. Now, they
                    don't need that propaganda plus and don't need the expense like the Germans had.
                    Unification is not something that you simply say, “Let's do it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find social life in Korea in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Work social there was a lot of. You would take politicians to lunch
                    where you would go to the tea house. Koreans didn't invite you home that often,
                    although with a number of people I simply knew, like my landlady or my Korean
                    teacher, they would. The normal thing the Korean politicians, both opposition
                    and government, did was the gisieng party, the equivalent of the geisha party.
                    There was lots of intra and inter embassy dinners. You had facilities in the 8th
                    Army clubs and things like that. Life was very nice there. I did a lot of
                    outdoor hiking, the mountains are right there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the Japanese treaty, we were obviously for this. How
                        did the political section operate to make it known?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: I can't remember. I do remember being told to monitor various
                    demonstrations, but I can't recall how we made known our position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling at that time about the threat from
                        the North?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Very serious, as it should be and always has been. The only time we
                    miscalculated, I think, was when Carter came in much later and there were
                    serious plans made for the withdrawal of American troops. But, that was later.
                    It was a serious thing. There was constant infiltrating of Korean agents along
                    the coast or across the DMZ. The regime, as could be expected, used this to try
                    to justify very tight controls on the opposition, but indeed (I think this came
                    clearer in my second tour in the 70's) they did make some headway with students.
                    There was an appeal there that resonated among students. This was a time when
                    you began to see things in print and even in newspapers and certainly in some of
                    the intellectual journals that was quite directly anti-American, using
                    terminology that sounded a bit North Korean in style. But, the threat is real,
                    it is only 30 miles away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your impressions about the relations between
                        the embassy and the American military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: That was a big issue and depended on the ambassador. Sneider, who was
                    there in the '70s spent a lot of his time at the American military types and
                    very little time with the Koreans. I thought the relationship was basically
                    good. There was no question on the part of the UN Command, which was basically
                    American, that the embassy was in charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that Berger and later Brown were
                        able to get along with the military camp? There have been very strong
                        commanders who...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, the relationship was good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1966 and where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Then I came back to INR to the East Asia division. My bag was the
                    Chinese involvement in Vietnam. This was the period when Alan Whiting was there.
                    Fred Green came in later from, I guess it was Yale.</p>

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Until 1968.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alan Whiting was there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, and then Fred Green later took over the job. Nethercut was there.
                    Jim Leonard, who later went on to become an ambassador of some kind with
                    disarmament, was there. Bob Drexler was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alan Whiting apparently had written this book “China
                        Crosses the Yalu,” that said there had been miscalculations on our part in
                        Korea, and the same thing could happen in Vietnam. And there were others who
                        were saying this was different. Did you get any feel for that sort of
                        tension on what China is going to do in Vietnam? What we can do and what we
                        can't do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: No, to my recollection the feeling was that China had no need to
                    intervene with the kind of intervention that we had over the Yalu. That Chinese
                    assistance plus Soviet assistance plus what the Viet Cong showed themselves able
                    to do, would be enough. I don't think we ever worried about full scale Chinese
                    intervention. In those days too, there was a realization that the Vietnamese
                    would not really be happy to have the Chinese there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were looking at China regarding Vietnam, was the
                        split with the Soviet Union pretty apparent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: It was just becoming so. The split philosophically was clear and the
                    Chinese had sent all these Soviet experts home, but, of course, it reached a
                    crescendo a month later with the Damansky Island incident, the border incident
                    with the Soviets. China, too, you must remember, at that time they were really
                    obsessed with their own cultural revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression about what we knew about China
                        from the INR perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: There was a lot of speculation, especially during the cultural
                    revolution. It depended on who you read. We all had opinions. I was by no means
                    a China scholar, I was just following the FBIS and the reporting out of Hong
                    Kong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the people you were working with in INR beginning to
                        realize the enormity of what the cultural revolution was doing to the

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, I think so. Have you talked to people like Jack Friedman? After
                    Nethercut left he was the division director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I will have to get to him. I like to pick up what other
                        people were thinking at the time. What was your work essentially?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: My work was pretty much confined to Chinese intentions and Chinese
                    involvement in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you did this were you looking at clues in the FBIS and
                        running them up against the model of the Chinese crossing the Yalu and
                        seeing if we were getting parallels and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Not so much crossing the Yalu, just what they were sending, what they
                    were saying. Of course, crossing the Yalu type of approach was an eventuality if
                    it came to that and was something that you really were concerned about. But we
                    didn't think it a high likelihood.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Then I went to do the Far East portfolio on the Soviet desk. I took

                    the Sino-Soviet split, the Damansky Island episode. I do recall wondering why
                    the desk was set up in this way. In other words, is it better to follow China's
                    relationship with the Soviet Union from the Chinese side or from the Soviet
                    side. Obviously a bit of both has to be done. I really didn't have enough to do.
                    I remember I made this joke with Sam Wise, who was in the office at that time,
                    that when my phone did ring, I would blow on the phone to indicate blowing the
                    dust off. It just wasn't an active job and I was glad to get out of there. John
                    Hemenway was in the office then. He later became an outspoken critic of the
                    Foreign Service. I guess he had been kicked out, which was an easy thing to do
                    in those days. The Soviet desk was a lot larger on the multilateral side than
                    perhaps it should have been at that point. But, as I say, I didn't stay and
                    didn't get wrapped up in the issues.</p>

                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From our analysis, what brought this about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: It was just a high point in tensions between the two countries. China
                    was then going on to pursue all these territorial claims going back to Tzarist
                    days. It was a growing feeling, I suppose on Mao's part, that he wasn't going to
                    follow Soviet leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From our perspective, how were the Soviets looking at
                        this? Were they taking the China threat seriously?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, yes. Throughout my whole career when you could get people to talk
                    about this, China was public enemy number one. China at one time was supposed to
                    be one of our brotherly socialist countries, but the Soviets feared China much
                    more than the United States. Of course, this eventually led to the Nixon opening
                    of China.</p>
                <p>The common wisdom was that world communism was monolithic, that it was under the
                    leadership of the Soviet Union and that other brotherly countries were little
                    brothers that would take big brother's orders. There were people who said this
                    was not the case, things had developed differently in different countries, China
                    will never submit. Nobody really much believed that until it began to happen.
                    You had academics predicting it.</p>

                <p>HURWITZ: I didn't leave Soviet affairs, I went then to Moscow as head of the
                    internal political section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Moscow this time from when to when?</hi>

                <p>HURWITZ: From 1969 to 1972.</p>

                <p>HURWITZ: The ambassador then was Jake Beam, he had just gotten there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: He seemed to be pretty much low key. I don't think he spoke Russian at
                    all, if any it was very, very minimal. He seemed to be not heavily involved. I
                    don't know why. Maybe he was already getting beyond his most active period. He
                    did go on to write a book, but I have not read that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: The political section was divided into two parts. One was multilateral
                    and one was internal. I was head of the internal section and had three people
                    under me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. It was 1969 and Brezhnev came in in 1964.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, there was a big difference. The regime closed in on itself with
                    respect to contacts. When I was there in 1958-60, Politburo members would show
                    up for the Fourth of July and there was a lot of contact. It was an atmosphere,
                    I recall, for example, in 1958 at the Queen's Birthday Party at the British
                    embassy, a lot of diplomats went in their cords suits and I remember standing
                    with Kirichenko, who was a member of the Politburo, in a dark black suit and he
                    looks at me and says, “Do you think I am dressed all right?” That came to a
                    sudden stop and you were lucky if you got a few people from the America Section
                    or a few of the technical ministries. No Politburo people or Party people would
                    go around. Q: Was there any sense that the embassy was being somewhat bypassed
                    by the Kissinger/Dobrynin relationship?</p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, some things we only learned about later. Even Kissinger's memoirs
                    talk about back channel. The most glaring example of this was made clear to us
                    out there when Kissinger came to Moscow in 1971 or '72 and was there for at
                    least a day without Beam, the ambassador, knowing about it. He had brought on
                    his plane Dobrynin. So you have the situation where Dobrynin is chatting with
                    Kissinger all the way across the Atlantic. Beam was left out of the picture
                    entirely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In many ways one might say that Beam was particularly
                        selected in order not to be a challenger.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, you could conceivably say that. Kissinger cut out not only the
                    embassy, but the State Department too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this reflect itself on what you all were
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: It didn't affect my work. My work was very low level. We were seeking
                    out information where we could get it. The newspapers became much less
                    revealing, although they had never by any means told the full story under
                    Khrushchev, they told less and less of the situation as time went on. So, I was
                    doing again a lot one on one, man -in-the-street type of conversations. I would
                    go to lectures, etc. An example during my first tour, although there were others
                    later, right after Pasternak won the Nobel Prize, the press was full of
                    denunciations of the Nobel committee and Pasternak was a turncoat, etc. I went
                    to a lecture at the University of Moscow, a student lecture, and the lecturer is
                    standing up there denouncing the book, denouncing Pasternak, saying the book
                    says this and it is wrong. Then one student leaps up in the back of the hall and
                    points his finger at the lecturer and says, “Have you read the book?” The
                    lecturer had to admit that he hadn't read the book. That was the end of lecture,
                    consternation.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>This sort of thing didn't make the press and it was the kind of thing that we
                    reported on. We reported on food shortages, salaries levels that were never
                    published. It was the kind of thing that Kremlinologists were doing carefully
                    with the analysis of the press and the journals. One of the great coups really
                    along these lines was Marray Afeshbach who was analyzing data from seemingly
                    innocuous Soviet statistics. But, if you put them together with other obscure
                    statistics it showed terrible developments in infant mortality or in alcoholism
                    or in population welfare in general. A lot of our effort was trying to determine
                    what was really going on, where things really stand. It was not a question of
                    talking about policy, you knew what they were going to say. And, certainly at my
                    level, and even at Beam's level, it wasn't a question of making demarches
                    frequently on what the Soviets ought to do. That was done by Kissinger, by
                    Nixon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting about the Soviet attitude towards
                        Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, the Soviets, and this became clear in so many ways, didn't know
                    what to think about Vietnam. Yet, if you absorbed the line and you were inclined
                    to spout it yourself, it was easy for a Soviet student or a man in the street to
                    parrot that line. More often than that though, you came across this sort of
                    conflict. The Soviets through many, many years of experience almost
                    automatically wrote off what the regime told them. If the regime said so, it
                    can't really be true. I can't think of any specific instance, but there were
                    many instances where I struck up a conversation with somebody and after you got
                    through all the praise for what the Americans did for them in World War II, he
                    would then go into, “We don't know what is going on in Vietnam. I don't know, it
                    is a question. Maybe you should be there, maybe you shouldn't be there, but if
                    our press is saying that you are doing wrong, I am not so sure.” The Soviets
                    faced that problem in later years. Almost everything they said was almost
                    immediately discounted, and that was true about Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up disquiet about what China was up
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Absolutely. That stems not only to the concern about this huge neighbor
                    that is making claims about Russian areas, but it is also a prevalent Russian
                    racism that extends to the Chinese, and their own “black” people, the Central
                    Asians. They are terrible racists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There had been a great push in the late '60s, Lumumba
                        University and all that. What were you getting both times about third world
                        students and their indoctrination or lack thereof in the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: There were many, many incidents between black African students and
                    Soviet students. Both sides were very unhappy with the situation. The Russians
                    were unhappy with these guys going out with Russian girls or flaunting money,
                    which even the limited money third world students might have, seemed like
                    luxuries to what the Soviets had. And the Africans were unhappy with the way
                    they were being treated. One would have to question in retrospect was this much
                    of a plus or just throwing away a lot of money at something that had a
                    counterproductive effect. I seem to think it was counterproductive. It certainly
                    worked with some. I think it worked with Afghans, but they were neighbors and
                    that would be a special case. It worked with Cubans because the Soviets followed
                    up with enormous influx of technology and bought the Cuban sugar. But, in other
                    cases, I'm not too sure how that really paid off. I don't think it paid off at
                    all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find since you were in internal affairs for the
                        second time that there was a certain change of focus yet about looking at
                        the nationalities as nationalities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, it was beginning and again more so with the Baltic states. My view
                    at the time I think was pretty much borne out, was that Central Asia was not an
                    area that was either a tender spot at the time nor would it really develop into
                    one. Central Asia with some exceptions, Uzbekistan is probably an exception,
                    really benefitted—Kyrgyzstan, no question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, it was very obvious that it was on the receiving end
                        rather than the giving end.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: That was the debate that took place sub rosa all the time. By the time
                    Khrushchev came in with glasnost, people could talk about it publicly. The
                    debate was whether Central Asia took more from Moscow or was forced to give
                    more. In most cases they took more. And, they were Islamic to the extent in most
                    cases they were circumcised and they married and died with Muslim rituals, but
                    other than that there was no real interest in Islam. That has sort of almost
                    artificially been stimulated now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Orthodox Church during this time, the

                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: I used to go very frequently but there wasn't much movement. Khrushchev,
                    liberal as he was in other areas, was not very friendly to the Church. For years
                    you would go to church and there would be only old people there, basically old
                    women. We always used to go to the Easter service, which is bigger than
                    Christmas, and you would have the midnight service and then there would be a
                    procession around the church (Christ has risen). At all these events, outside
                    partially held back, restrained by the police, there would be a big crowd of
                    Komsomol types who had been dragooned into this. Although this was one instance
                    I think where the political line, atheist line, was pretty much in line with
                    what most students did honestly think. That is, the Church is corrupt, was a
                    narcotic to the masses. This, of course, was stimulated by the press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Jewish community at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, even during my first tour, we began following very closely the
                    Jewish question. I did it partially out of curiosity to see what it was like.
                    The congress was beginning to get interested in seeing what the situation
                    was—not immigration that was too far in the future. Remember in 1948 Stalin was
                    gearing up for the Jewish doctors plot but he died fortuitously. So, part of
                    every officer's itinerary when he went to a town was to see whether there was a
                    synagogue. Now that led to some odd situations. I remember looking for the
                    synagogue in Lvov, which was a big center of Jewish settlement years ago. There
                    was no active synagogue and I couldn't find it. The Russians very, very rarely
                    had a phone book, and even if they printed one they were always unavailable, but
                    they did have these information kiosks where you went and asked for an address
                    or phone number and paid your three kopecks. I used to have these little jokes.
                    I would go to a kiosk, and my Russian for a brief sentence was accentless, and I
                    would ask for the number of the American embassy and they would get very
                    concerned, they didn't know it. In Lvov I went and asked for the address of the
                    old synagogue. She was very disturbed and may have even called somebody. So, I
                    walked around town and finally went into a small bakery shop. The guy looked
                    Jewish to me and I asked him where it was. He knew and pointed down the street.
                    I went down there and it was now an indoor basketball court which was ideal
                    because under the old system the men sat downstairs and the woman sat in the
                    gallery so you had a place to play basketball on the floor and the spectators
                    would sit around the top. We followed that in every city we went to if there had
                    been a Jewish population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there something that was identifiable as a Jewish
                        community?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: In Moscow, yes. In my first tour we went frequently to the main
                    synagogue and in those days everybody was old who was going in. Around the
                    synagogue on Saturday morning were old Jewish beggars. There would always be one
                    or two Jewish guides who were working for the government who seeing you were a
                    foreigner would try to separate you from the people so you couldn't talk to them
                    and offered to bring you inside and talk to you. You tried to avoid that. That
                    happened wherever there was a synagogue. That was in the '50s and the beginning
                    of tourism and the Soviets quickly learned that they had to control the Jews
                    that might be coming to either see relatives or see what it was like. That
                    changed drastically in my second tour for one reason, the Six Day War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the Israeli tremendous victory over
                        the Arabs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. That energized the Jewish population, particularly the young who
                    had nothing to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It also meant they were no longer losers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Right. It gave them pride. So, when you went to the synagogue on Friday
                    night, the street was filled with kids dancing and just talking. We had an
                    embassy officer who was assigned to go down there every Friday and just stand
                    around and talk to people because you found out lots of things because the
                    Jewish population by this time was willing to talk. This was sort of a turning
                    point from a group that had been very frightened to a group that was becoming
                    self assertive. Now, the older ones were still sort of frightened because they
                    remembered the worst. These younger kids didn't remember the late forties. The
                    Soviets gradually, even under Brezhnev, began to open up. There were Yiddish
                    traveling theater groups that played for a few days in various cities. And then,
                    of course, you had the opening up, the immigration infusion which began in the
                    early '70s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the political section involved in the
                        immigration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: At first there was real immigration, they allowed it. We got involved in
                    the whole issue of Refuseniks when they were shutting it down. That happened
                    when I was on the Soviet desk in 1979. Back to the 1969-72 period, immigration
                    was just beginning to get underway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any Israeli representation of any sort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: During my first tour there was an Israeli embassy which was closed after
                    the Six Day War, so by the time I went back in 1969 it was closed, there was no
                    representation.</p>

                        Were they very apparent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, yes. The Egyptians were there in full force, the Egyptian military
                    people were there. I remember I got friendly, and it was sort of touchy for him
                    but he was interested, with an Egyptian air force major who lived in my complex.
                    He had me to dinner once or twice and we talked. He was a very nice fellow. It
                    started because somehow they were delivering my “Herald Tribune” to his mailbox.
                    But they were there in pretty big force as well as the Syrians and the
                    Iraqis.</p>

                        the Soviets with the Arab group? Was this a marriage of convenience or was
                        there more to it? This was the Kissinger period when there was sort of the
                        feeling that everything that happened in the Middle East was somehow
                        instigated by the Soviets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I didn't work directly on that but, yes, I think the view was that we
                    were backing the Israelis and the Soviets were backing the Arabs and that was
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because, when you talk with people dealing with the Middle
                        East they were saying that this was a home grown thing and the Middle
                        Easterners were taking advantage of both the United States and the
                        Soviets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I don't think we viewed the Soviets as stimulating any of this, but that
                    they were to some extent clients which was taken as a matter of course, I
                    thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the feeling towards the Soviet economy during
                        the 1969-72 period? Looking at this Brezhnev period, how was the
                        economy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: They were going through some difficult periods then, although it was
                    much worse in 1981 when I went back for a couple of months TDY in Moscow as
                    political counselor. It was far worse even in 1986-88. But, already in the '70s
                    you were getting shortages, hidden price rises, items disappearing and
                    reappearing either at smaller quantities for the same price or higher prices for
                    the same amount. We all saw big problems, although I don't think anyone in the
                    embassy had a big enough picture or privy to enough information to make global
                    estimates as to what the Soviet economy might do or was doing. Things just
                    didn't trickle down. Cement production might have been the greatest in the world
                    but didn't mean a thing. Later at lectures in Leningrad we would hear things
                    like, “The USSR is the largest producer of shoes in the world. Leningrad was the
                    center of shoe production yet what we do with our shoes, the lecturer was
                    saying, “is to take them directly from the factory to the warehouse. We don't
                    send them into the retail network because nobody wants to buy them. So, we just
                    let them rot in the factories.” We were all beginning to see what was
                    essentially a basic flaw in the Soviet system, and that is that there was no
                    connection between production and consumption. The factories produced to meet a
                    plan, not to sell. We were reporting this kind of stuff, but I don't think
                    anybody drew the conclusion at that point that if this continues they will be
                    exhausting resources for no real gain. You could see the waste there. They were
                    living high on the hog with oil exports, but not really doing anything with the
                    proceeds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The thing we were really concerned about was the military
                        threat and all accounts were that the Soviets were building up a tremendous
                        fleet, had very advanced aircraft, tanks, artillery, etc. I would hear
                        tourists come back and say, “How can the Soviet army be that much of a
                        threat when the elevators don't work?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: We constantly reported on these anomalies that whatever the overall
                    statistics say for production of A, B or C, it simply is not evident in the
                    civilian economy at any rate. What is evident is exactly what you said, the
                    elevators don't work, things break down, people 50 kilometers outside of Moscow
                    were living Tolstoyan lives in terms of food transportation and facilities.</p>
                <p>But, I think what became clear and was becoming clear at that time was that there
                    is a real separate approach to the economy—the best in resources, the best in
                    facilities, the best in minds were devoted to the military production. And, this
                    is something that we in the embassy really couldn't see. At the time there were
                    obviously overhead photos, but this was something that I didn't see. And, going
                    back now, I worked in the historical office for a while, you would see some of
                    the reports CIA was doing and you would be looking down on pictures of
                    submarines in various places and see what they had access to which didn't exist
                    in the embassy, at least at my level. So, you couldn't see the best. If you
                    looked at what we saw and the perceptive tourist saw, not just the Kremlin and
                    things like that, yes, the feeling was that these guys were going to hell, they
                    were not going anyplace. What we didn't see was the elite military kind of
                    devotion of resources.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back but also at the time, was there a mind set,
                        do you think, within not just the embassy, but within the government, and
                        maybe the United States in general, of the Soviets as being a threat and not
                        looking at the other side, the major weaknesses that brought it down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, there were things that brought it down that were not evident at
                    the time at all, in fact, didn't exist. No, we saw the threat. Washington
                    through all these intelligence reports was aware of the military capabilities.
                    We tended just prudently to accept a lot of what the Soviets said about “We are
                    the wave of the future.” We did see them active in all parts of the world. So,
                    it was perfectly reasonable and prudent to consider the threat real. That we in
                    the embassy and some other people who visited saw the weak parts of the Soviet
                    Union, the economic weaknesses, the grumbling, public discontent, lack of
                    initiative, yes, that was there but you still didn't say that despite all this
                    other stuff it really was not going to work. I think we felt it would work.</p>
                <p>What we didn't see at the time and neither did the Soviets see was that there was
                    something else that would begin to work (and this is all retrospect, although we
                    played a role in its beginnings), and that was that information could not be
                    controlled. They tried, there was jamming, but in time technical advances just
                    made it almost impossible to control. And the Soviets, I think were faced with a
                    dilemma. If they were to bring the rest of the country along, to match the West
                    economically, technically and militarily, they had to have contact with
                    scientists in the West. They had to know what was going on elsewhere. That is
                    the kind of dilemma. How do you keep abreast of what is happening and get
                    nuclear scientists believing we are the best when they know that everybody else
                    is doing a lot better? We contributed to that from the very beginning with the
                    radio. I remember I had a funny feeling...I was in Donetsk, which is way in the
                    south of either the Ukraine or Russia. It is an old coal mining area and where
                    Khrushchev is from. I remember standing in the square, I had gone there in 1971,
                    of Donetsk and looking around and feeling...I had been listening that morning to
                    see whether VOA...that was another thing we carried radios with us to test VOA
                    or Radio Liberty reception. Well, Radio Liberty and VOA came in very well and I
                    was just thinking that these people need this information from the outside the
                    same way that they need bread that they were buying at the store. The Soviets
                    couldn't have it both ways. They couldn't show the world through exchanges and
                    things like that, that they were doing fine and keep out the rest of the world.
                    And that was something that hastened or made the fall inevitable.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I came back to be the Czech/Bulgarian desk officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you doing that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: From 1972 to 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the Czech/Bulgarian desk rest within the
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: That was in the Office of Eastern European Affairs, which I believe
                    until shortly before my arrival had been split into a northern tier and southern
                    tier. Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Romania being in the south and Poland,
                    Czechoslovakia and Hungary in the north. That was joined together and the
                    officer director was John Baker, who had been a second secretary in Moscow in
                    1958. I was on my way to Moscow, in the Paris embassy cafeteria, when I read in
                    the “Herald Tribune” that he had been PNGed, but that is another story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place Bulgaria/ Czechoslovakia is sort of
                        a....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: They have to combine two countries and one desk officer because of
                    staffing problems and those were two countries—Bulgaria wasn't a very active
                    portfolio, but Czechoslovakia at that time was much more so because it was the
                    time we were negotiating the endless gold/claims issue. So, it was simply a
                    question of how you could double up and not over burden an officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Geographically it didn't make much of a hell of a
                        difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: No, it was a question of work load. But, I found being the desk officer
                    for two countries, even two relatively inactive countries, was still pretty much
                    of a burden because you always had double duty. You had to write national day
                    things for two countries, two sets of dates to keep in mind, two sets of
                    programs that were going on. So, even though they weren't front burner stuff
                    from a Seventh Floor standpoint, it was still a considerable amount of work.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>I should add, I almost forgot, I was at the same time the desk officer for the
                    Baltic states, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia. This was largely a matter of
                    ceremonial duties having to go to national day events and read and write the
                    Secretary's greetings to each of these countries. Of course they were all
                    variations on the same theme of keep up the good work and we will continue not
                    to recognize the forcible incorporation of your country into the Soviet Union.
                    It was an interesting portfolio.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take this in pieces. First let's talk about the
                        Baltic states. What was the attitude of the Department about these
                        states?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: The attitude of the Department was very clear, we did not recognize
                    their incorporation into the USSR. They maintained and were fully accredited
                    their diplomatic missions here. We did have, in retrospect, a strange stricture
                    there and that is that at that point we would not recognize as a Baltic diplomat
                    anybody who had not been in the Baltic diplomatic services at the time of the
                    Soviet takeover in 1940, so we were dealing with some pretty old guys. Now, that
                    later changed. The Lithuanian charg�, I remember, on one occasion, he was well
                    into his '80s, he struggled up to my office and eased himself into the chair
                    beside my desk and then said he had forgotten why he had come to my office. But,
                    it was largely a public relations operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You having been in the Soviet Union, what did you feel?
                        Did you sort of think this wasn't really serious stuff, this was for
                        domestic politics, or did you think there was a glimmer that something might
                        happen soon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, no, it was clearly for domestic politics. On the other hand having
                    been in both Lithuania and Estonia, in my first tour in Moscow, and having seen
                    Tallinn, Estonia, the atmosphere was as if in an occupied city, there was no
                    question but that these three countries were not meant to be part of the Soviet
                    Union. Whether they would have in the long run fit into the Russian empire
                    without communism, that is another story. It was definitely a takeover. I never
                    foresaw the breakup of the Soviet Union, but I did feel that there was a lot of
                    rationale for not recognizing this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you in that position monitor anything we said about
                        the Soviet Union to make sure we didn't say something which might
                        absentmindedly acknowledge the occupation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh yes. I monitored, the EE desk monitored as well as the local
                    communities. There were a lot of Baltic-Americans, so to speak and they were
                    very careful about this sort of thing. Now, occasionally we had to justify
                    things that we were doing in the Baltic states. I must say this is a rather
                    interesting and a very sophisticated kind of a question. We claimed, the US
                    government claimed, that we were running these USIA programs in the Baltic
                    states. This was not because of any recognition of their domination by the
                    Soviet Union, but simply as a means of keeping in touch. It is an old story. If
                    you completely isolate or refuse to recognize something then the people who are
                    in that particular entity, in this case the Baltics, don't have the opportunity
                    to get in touch with Americans to make their case known on the ground. So, we
                    monitored closely any contacts we had, but we were frequently put in the
                    position of defending some of those contacts to the Baltic community here that
                    wanted none whatsoever. Eventually they came around and saw that contacts, while
                    the Soviets might want to trumpet these contacts as an indication that we
                    recognized their sovereignty, nevertheless they performed a real service in
                    keeping alive contacts and giving some hope to people that they weren't simply
                    being just swept under the rug.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any congress people who were after you on
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. I can't recall any specific ones but there were and the reactions
                    of congress were important to us. But, I must underline that as time went on the
                    whole question of...indeed the one big issue which came up at the time was the
                    Helsinki Final Act, which the Soviets....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the CSCE?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. I believe this
                    was signed in 1975. Leading up to it the big dichotomy that I remember was on
                    the one hand the Soviets were claiming that this was a recognition of post World
                    War II borders, that they wouldn't be changed by force and that they would in a
                    sense be recognized. And, of course, the Baltic community didn't like that here.
                    On the other hand, it enshrined an agreement signed by the Soviets the concept
                    of free exchange of ideas, press access, etc., the so-called basket three, the
                    third item on the agenda. We went ahead and signed it and I think everybody came
                    to realize, more so than anybody the Soviets, that this was really an important
                    win for the West. All the dissidents in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union
                    began to cite this as a reason for demanding their rights for their country. The
                    Soviets had agreed that this would be the case—family exchanges, easy access,
                    easy egress. And this did become sort of a legal hook that the dissident
                    movement could really be pegged on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is one of the contributing factors to the dissolution
                        of the Soviet Union, when looking back on it. But, even our Secretary of
                        State, Henry Kissinger, was very dubious about that. This was not his thing.
                        He sort of came into it at the end but almost tried to undercut it, from
                        what I have gathered.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I am not really aware of that, although it would be in character.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have talked to people in interviews who were on the
                        negotiating side and found that he was saying things to Dobrynin, the Soviet
                        ambassador, which sort of undercut what our people in the field were doing
                        because this was not Henry Kissinger's thing. Well, moving down to Bulgaria.
                        In the 1972-74 period what was the situation as you saw it and what were our
                        interests there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, you know Bulgaria was really just a blip on the screen. Bulgaria
                    was rather an obedient servant of the Soviet Union. It was nothing close to what
                    people used to say was, the 16th republic of the Soviet Union, but on the other
                    hand Zhivkov played ball thoroughly with the Soviets. On the other hand when I
                    left Moscow, knowing I was going to become a desk officer, I took a trip to both
                    Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, and I must say coming out of Moscow directly to
                    Bulgaria was almost like going to the West. Here in the middle of Sofia there
                    was a traffic sign with arrows pointing to Rome and to Athens. There was
                    relatively a bustling, over flowing market of food, stuff you would never see in
                    the Soviet Union. There was Coke on sale all over. There were discos and that
                    sort of thing. There was a Jewish population of those who remained, and they
                    were free to go. In the Soviet Union this didn't start until 1974-75, the
                    ability for the Jews to get out if they wanted. In Bulgaria most of the Jews had
                    left, they were allowed to go soon after the war. Those who remained, I talked
                    to a number of them, had no problems. A lot of them, strangely enough, spoke a
                    version of Spanish having arrived originally from Spain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My goodness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. In fact I went to the synagogue there and there was an old guy on
                    duty, so to speak, and I started to say something in Russian, feeling that
                    everybody did speak Russian, and he said, “Hablo Espanol?” He told me the story
                    that he spoke Spanish at home.</p>
                <p>We really had no contentious issues because there wasn't a human rights problem.
                    The maltreatment of the Turkish population had not really begun full swing, at
                    least it didn't become a major issue at that time. Either we ignored it or the
                    Turks ignored it at that time. We had just before I arrived signed a consular
                    agreement with Bulgaria.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I don't really recall. I think there were some approaches and that they
                    were being rather cooperative. It wasn't as if they were thumbing their noses at
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we were training drug-sniffing dogs. I was in
                        Athens during part of this, 1970-74, and all of us in that area were
                        concerned about the flow of narcotics, mainly hashish at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Who was the ambassador when you were there?</p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Telly Torbert. He was there for my full tour. In fact, during my tenure
                    on the desk, the relationship with Bulgaria was on a more even keel than it had
                    ever been. We had the first sort of high level visit by a deputy premier, a new
                    ambassador had come who spoke good English. So things with Bulgaria were either
                    looking up slightly or were not an issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself trying to explain that Bulgaria was
                        not really an absolute satellite of the Soviet Union?</hi>

                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, that and the fact that we had no outstanding contentious issues
                    between us. Bulgaria in the UN or any international forum, of course, touted the
                    Soviet line, but on other issues that were contentious between us and the
                    Soviets at the time, arms shipments, treatment of their dissidents or their
                    minorities or their Jews, Bulgaria was rather clean and we had no
                    complaints.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turning to Czechoslovakia during the 1972-74 period, four
                        years after the Soviet crack down in 1968, what was the situation as you
                        viewed it from the desk and what were our issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: The Czech government was pretty much a mess. They threw out all of their
                    professionals in 1968 so you had pretty much a group of hard liners. Our major
                    issue at the time was this gold/claims. During the war the allies, had come into
                    possession of a stash of Czech gold, which was hidden someplace or in a bank
                    some where, and we took control of that. That was the Czech side. We had all
                    these outstanding claims on the part of US citizens who had had their property
                    nationalized in 1948. So, these were long standing negotiations on how to
                    resolve this issue. It came to fruition after my tenure. But, the question was
                    how much they would settle these claims for before we gave them the gold
                    back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who handled the negotiations? Did we have a claims
                        person?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: There was a commission, but I forget the details.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the day-to-day work of our embassy? Was it a
                        difficult place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Czechoslovakia was a fairly difficult place. You know the Czechs
                    historically it seems after World War II have been real nasty guys. They have
                    done the Soviets' bidding and done it in a rather nasty way in terms of
                    supplying arms to the IRA or developing syntex, an explosive, and sending it all
                    around. There was one incident, for example, when I was on the desk of an
                    American/Jewish leader who was visiting Czechoslovakia and disappeared. He was
                    later found floating in the Vltava River. At any rate, he may have been done in
                    by the Czechs, he may have been done in by some Palestinians roaming around
                    Czechoslovakia then. Czechoslovakia was kind of a training ground for
                    terrorists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They and the East Germans, at least at the official level,
                        seemed to jump into the whole nasty business with both feet.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. The guy who despatched Trotsky in Mexico City in 1940 was a Czech.
                    They just seemed to be prepared to do the Soviets' dirty work in many cases. So,
                    our relationship was very cool. Their ambassador here, Spa_ek, was a very urbane
                    fellow and he tried to sort of turn things around. He was a music lover and had
                    a lot of people to their beautiful embassy residence for either concerts or just
                    plain receptions. He may have been fighting this image but the image was there
                    nevertheless and reasonably so. We were also in the process of trying to
                    negotiate a consular agreement with them. I recall there were a number of
                    contentious issues. One of them was the circumstances under which a person born
                    in Czechoslovakia, but who was a nationalized American citizen, could go back to
                    Czechoslovakia and be assured of not being arrested for something he did
                    before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the general view at that time of the Czech
                        contribution to the Warsaw Pact? I would have thought if you were a Soviet
                        Warsaw Pact commander you would be a little dubious about the Polish army
                        and really want to keep it away from your supply lines, more than anything
                        else. But the East German army would probably do his bidding and how about
                        the Czech army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: The Czech upper echelons was cleaned out after 1968. I think that they
                    would be pretty much willing to rely on the Czechs. They were traditionally very
                    industrially advanced and made good weapons. I think they relied on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the desk point of view was there any feeling that
                        maybe Czechoslovakia would break up into parts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: No, no. All that was very much sublimated, not only for Czechoslovakia
                    but for the Soviet Union. Slightly off the subject, there was a certain amount
                    of cohesion which I think resulted not simply from force, but, certainly in the
                    Soviet case and I think in the Czech case as well, the pride that comes from
                    being a member of a nice country club where they are somebody. The question of
                    breakup never entered anybody's mind.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: For the first month, Art Hartman asked me to be a staff aide or special
                    assistant up in EUR, so I did that. Then I went to CU where I worked as a deputy
                    to Yale Richmond, who was a long time exchange type for the Soviet Union. When
                    cultural exchanges were shifted over to USIA, he went to USIA. I stayed in that
                    job for about three months. Then I was assigned to Korea, as political
                    counselor. Phil Habib broke my assignment to CU to send me out to Seoul.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will move to Korea in a minute, but what was your
                        impression of how Art Hartman ran EUR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: He was very competent, very good. I was just sort of looking over
                    cables, not sitting in on the meetings. The big issue at the time was the
                    Turkish invasion of Cyprus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that was in July, 1974. That always struck me that
                        EUR all of a sudden got stuck with Turkey and Greece, which wasn't up to its
                        sophisticated standards having just been transferred over to EUR from NEA.
                        All of a sudden people used to dealing with France, England and Germany, had
                        these two squabbling NATO members on their hands.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>What were you doing in CU?</p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Exchanges. This was becoming pretty much of a growth industry. It had
                    been coming along all the time since my first tour in Moscow with Sal Hurok and
                    all those exchanges beginning. Then there was a kind of freeze period after
                    Khrushchev kicked out, but then it started to blossom again. It had been shut
                    down for a while because of the 1968 Czechoslovakia event, but came back. It had
                    been given a great shot in the arm by the 1972 visit to Moscow of Nixon. All
                    kinds of agreements were signed covering health, energy, environment,
                    transportation and exchanges. So they were really bustling in that era. I can't
                    remember any specific problems or issues, but it was a major portion of our
                    relationship with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Korea from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: December, 1974 to late 1975. I had personal problems at home and cut my
                    tour short staying not quite a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are back in Korea. What was the political situation at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: There was a great deal of stability. The Park Chung Hee regime had
                    somewhat settled down. They were in the early stages of their economic upswing.
                    They had cleaned up Seoul to a great extent. Seoul was bustling, buildings were
                    going up even at that time, a subway had been put in, there was traffic all over
                    the place. When I was there the first time the only vehicles, a part from trucks
                    on the street, were jeeps. Beggars, who were prevalent in the early '60s, were
                    all gone. Korea was in the process of being transformed. What had been in 1961,
                    from our standpoint, a basket case economically, was now bustling. Certain
                    things they did were positively mind boggling to me. They had transformed those
                    bare, scraggly, granite slopes of the mountains into lush forests. They planted
                    fast growing pines turning the brown/gray mountains into lush green forests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They would have tree days, wouldn't they, where everybody
                        would go out and plant trees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. A lot of this was good old regimentation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: That was just one example that sums up how the place was bustling. They
                    had problems though because a lot of this economic growth took place at the
                    expense of the workers being exploited, if you look at it from an American
                    viewpoint—low wages, long hours, lousy working conditions. So, you did have a
                    burgeoning labor problem and that was a source of discontent. Some of the
                    laborers were being organized. Union members were being thrown into jail. You
                    had cases of political dissidents. The harassment of American missionaries who
                    were trying to work with the labor unions or these political groups. So, that
                    was one of the major issues at the time.</p>
                <p>You also had a new constitution propagated by the president which was very
                    stringent, the Yushin constitution. That was a sticking point in our
                    relationship. I think a lot of the problems never really have gone away. In
                    Korea, as you know, you always had a very active, sometimes explosive, student
                    movement. Some of their leaders were very left wing and we began to get examples
                    in the press there of complaints of American domination, toadying to the West,
                    and that sort of stuff. It smacked of communist propaganda. Some of these kids
                    were simply naive, but some of them, the regime felt and I think with some
                    justification, were being manipulated to a certain extent by North Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is going on today.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. I must say I was amazed to see some of those pictures of Yonsei
                    University recently on TV where students with iron bars were beating the hell
                    out of a policeman on the ground. They are very easily incited and explosive and
                    get very, very violent. It is something that the regime was always afraid of. I
                    remember in 1964 when they were concluding this treaty with Japan students were
                    out in the streets every day and the government handled it well, they didn't
                    kill anybody...the only person killed was a kid who fell off a truck that they
                    had commandeered...but it required a great deal of self control. Now, what
                    happened in Kwangju in 1980, I don't know. That is another story, another
                    regime. But, basically there is a problem. We may have said one thing but I
                    think all along with the DMZ 30 some miles away from Seoul we felt there was
                    something to worry about. The regime wasn't simply sending up a smoke screen
                    when it talked about communist threats...Mr. X is a communist so we will put him
                    in jail. That sort of argumentation may have been abused, and obviously it was,
                    but it did have some grain of truth to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find relations with the US military during
                        this time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, they were good. Part of the reason they were so good was that Dick
                    Sneider, the ambassador, was on very good terms with the UN commander, Richard
                    Stilwell. I think Sneider had a long political/military background and was very
                    comfortable dealing with the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a key person in the Okinawa reversion with Japan.
                        He was a Japanese hand, I think. Were you having any problems dealing with
                        the dissidents like Kim Dae Jung?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, Kim Dae Jung by the time I got there was under house arrest, I
                    think. He was arrested in 1974. We saw him on occasion. He once came to lunch at
                    the DCM's house. We kept in touch with him. But, I must say, Sneider, for what
                    ever reason, had very little truck with the opposition, the missionaries, the
                    labor leaders. He was very cool to them, unlike Habib who was all over the place
                    and saw everybody. His door was open to anybody and he didn't care about
                    offending the government in any way. Sneider was different. Personally, he
                    simply didn't get along with these people, he had no time for them.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, the missionaries were not his bag at all. I always
                        felt he was uncomfortable with the so- called human rights which
                        granted...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, he was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, that wasn't big during this time, it came a little
                        later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>At the same time they had good connections with the US military which was
                    extremely important and really with the Park government, I think.</p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, they did, that is true. If we had done what a person like
                    Congressman Fraser wanted us to do, I think we would have been in big
                    trouble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is very difficult. Did you have any connection with the
                        missionaries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Not so much the missionaries, but with the opposition. My Korean at that
                    time was very good and I liked to use it. I saw a lot of the opposition types.
                    The missionaries I didn't know so well my second tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the view towards the new Yushin constitution?
                        That was just getting started when you were there, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: There was a definite feel that Park Chung Hee had turned the screws on
                    tightening the situation and with the kind of growth and prosperity it lead to
                    more people being inclined to question this. In the old days Koreans, apart from
                    the students, were much more willing to take things as they came. As time went
                    on and the country became more stable and more prosperous you had more people
                    speaking out, and I guess that is what tipped his hand towards a constitution
                    with tighter control.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about relations between Korea and Japan? We have
                        always gotten in between on this, too. The Koreans don't like the Japanese
                        but can't get away from them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, in a sense they really don't want to get away from them. There is
                    a sort of love/hate relationship with the love bit being very surreptitious. You
                    would find down back alleys back issues of Japanese magazines being sold. Most
                    people at that time spoke Japanese. I guess that is diminishing rapidly. But, I
                    think any serious Korean knows that Japan is a real factor in the area and they
                    simply can't have a Greece/Turkey kind of relationship.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I came back and went as deputy to Bob Fearey, who was then head of MCT,
                    which was part of M as a combating terrorism outfit. It was very small, three
                    people, Fearey, myself, and another fellow.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I was there until August, 1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. This was the low point of my Foreign Service career, bouncing
                    around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this happens, I did the same at one point. I think
                        it is interesting to get a glimpse at this counter terrorism because later
                        this is turned into a real growth industry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, well, it was starting then, this was the heyday of the
                    hijackers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the situation was as the State
                        Department saw it and what your office was doing with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: This had been set up very recently before my arrival. Fearey was an old
                    Japan hand, I don't know where he is today. He didn't seem to be a very
                    energetic director at the time. I think we were gearing up as a government to
                    handle this issue in a coordinated way. Once a month, or perhaps it was once
                    every two weeks, there was a meeting that State chaired of all the various
                    agencies that were involved in terrorism—CIA, FBI, Defense—and we would exchange
                    information, have briefings. I remember at one briefing a guy was showing us
                    various weapons that terrorists use. The whole thrust of the thing at the time
                    was really protecting our missions. We had had our ambassador to Lebanon killed
                    in 1975, Frank Meloy. I believe we also had the assault on the embassy in Sudan
                    where the ambassador and the DCM were killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cleo Noel and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Right. Three American soldiers had been kidnaped in Eritrea, and that
                    was a big issue. They were finally freed. Another big thing that we followed
                    very closely was hijacking of the El Al plane that was taken to Entebbe. There
                    was a lot going on and we really didn't have the staff to handle it. This whole
                    thing was in its early stages of development from the standpoint of the
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the feeling the State Department had to do something
                        but didn't know quite what to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, the thing was getting off the ground. We were not staffed by high
                    ranking people. Fearey I believe was an O-1 at the time. It was part of M,
                    Management, rather than being attached to the Secretary. I don't think there was
                    enough coordination at that point between the various agencies. I am sure
                    technically also it was rather primitive compared to the various approaches
                    taken today. The whole question of infiltration of groups, we weren't really
                    sure of the groups, and, of course, they change over time. The big enemy was the
                    PLO and the various Palestinian organizations. I would say it was fairly
                    pedestrian. It would take time before it began to develop into something.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1976 you left the counter terrorism office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, because Phil Habib wanted me as Korean country director, so I was
                    desk officer for Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Phil Habib at that time was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: He was assistant secretary for EA, East Asian Affairs. He didn't stay
                    very long. He almost immediately went up and became Under Secretary for
                    Political Affairs. Art Hummel then became assistant secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1976 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Until I had my difficulties with Dick Holbrooke. I lasted there until
                    May, 1977.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about the 1976-77 period. How did you
                        find the view of Korea first with the end of the Ford administration and
                        then moving into the Carter administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: The big issue when I came on the desk, one I think would have
                    strengthened Kissinger's view of the world, was the attack on and killing of the
                    two soldiers in the DMZ. Do you remember that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had just arrived in Korea as consul general as had Tom
                        Stern. We had all arrived in July. Dick Sneider laughed and said, “It is
                        nice and quiet here. There won't be any trouble, just keep your head down.”
                        Could you talk about the tree chopping thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I technically wasn't on the desk at the time, but they brought me up
                    from MCT to be part of a task force. That was a rather hairy situation.
                    Kissinger was really very ticked off. We were moving troops, naval forces and
                    were pretty close to a very, very strong reaction to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to capture this time because I think it was
                        an important event. Could you explain for someone who wouldn't know, what
                        happened up in the DMZ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: As I remember it, the American side wanted to remove a tree that was
                    obstructing the vision, line of sight, of the North Korean installation and
                    post. It was important that we have visual access to that thing. So, they were
                    in the act of chopping the tree down when they were set upon by a North Korean
                    patrol. This is all inside the DMZ. One of the North Koreans actually got a hold
                    of the ax and used it on two Americans soldiers who were killed. Then there were
                    some kind of skirmishes and the North Koreans withdrew. I don't think any shots
                    were fired. This happened when you were there?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: The reaction here was really very, very tough. I remember at one point,
                    one Saturday morning, Hummel had gone in and was going up to see Kissinger and
                    said why don't you come along. This was the only time I got to see Kissinger.
                    The door to Kissinger's office opens and he is ushered in and he beckons for me
                    to follow him so I follow him. He says, “Oh, Mr. Secretary, this is Ed Hurwitz,
                    the desk officer. Is it all right if he comes in?” Kissinger said, “What do you
                    mean is it all right, he is already in.” Then Kissinger was immediately on the
                    phone to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.</p>
                <p>At any rate, that was the first and only time I was brought into the Secretary's
                    office, so I don't know the details of what was being discussed. But, it was a
                    question of moving aircraft carriers, which we did move. And, it was a question
                    of being very, very tough. I think this was just prior to the opening of the
                    Republican National Convention. Kissinger, himself, was under attack by those in
                    the Republican Party who didn't like him. So, for whatever reason, he was very
                    disturbed by this incident and determined to do something. In the last analysis
                    we didn't do anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we went in and chopped down the tree.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, we did chop down the tree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were B-52s flying around and we were telling the
                        Koreans we were there. There was a lot of toing and froing. We didn't know
                        what the North Koreans were about. Did we get any feel for why they did
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: No. I think we chalked that up to what we chalk most things up to, the
                    inscrutable ways of the Koreans. Like six months ago moving troops into the DMZ.
                    That may have colored, at least for the remainder of the Ford administration,
                    our approach to Korea. If it hadn't been for the election and Jimmy Carter and
                    for Pat Derian in Human Rights Affairs and to a certain extent, Richard
                    Holbrooke, I suppose as forgiving as ever of any Korean tightening up in the
                    name of stability. What happened, of course, was a complete switch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Carter made the promise during the election campaign,
                        before he was in power, that he would essentially take our main military
                        ground division, the 2nd infantry division, out of Korea. I know when we
                        were in Korea at that time we thought this was a stupid move because it
                        would uncork things, but what was the view from the desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: If the desk was me the view was pretty much, “I will do anything I am
                    told to do.” This was not a high point with my career in a sense I was very
                    skeptical and really didn't think it was a good idea and sort of dragged my
                    feet. People from other agencies were brought in to write up how we were going
                    to do all this. How we were going to move out. They brought in Armacost, I don't
                    know what he was doing at the time. A big role in this was played by Mort
                    Abramowitz, who was at that time the DAS of ISA in the Pentagon. And, of course,
                    Holbrooke was new. And, they were gearing up to do this paper on why it should
                    be done and how it was going to be done.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, we began getting through the embassies in the area (New Zealand,
                    Australia, Philippines), expressions of deep concern on the part of the host
                    governments. Why were we doing this? It had worked in the past. It would be a
                    very destabilizing move.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, in the context we had just pulled out of South
                        Vietnam...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I have a strong feeling that the whole Vietnam experience was to a great
                    extent responsible for this, a part from Carter's own views about human rights,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think both the action and reaction were predicated on
                        Vietnam. Carter was saying we were not going to get involved in a land
                        conflict.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Holbrooke had had a long Vietnam experience and I think this played a
                    role there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, also the other countries were looking upon the fact,
                        “Is the United States a reliable ally?” So, it was Vietnam being played in
                        Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, “Is the United States a reliable ally?” is part of it, but I think
                    a lot of it was just very specific to this instance. Nobody knows what North
                    Korea is going to do. This has been a cheap insurance policy. Why must they be
                    pulled out now? We don't know what North Korea is going to do, but we have a
                    feeling that the only thing that has prevented North Korea from moving south had
                    been the presence of American forces. To change this now could be
                    disastrous.</p>
                <p>I don't know, I moved off the desk in somewhat less than a year, so I don't know
                    how this was dropped. It was clearly dropped. I believe the reaction of the
                    allies had a lot to do with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Certainly the embassy was not supportive.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: That probably helped. I certainly deserve no medal for heroism on this
                    score, although my lack of enthusiasm may have been evident enough to further
                    muddy the situation with Holbrooke. But, that was simply a clash of
                    personalities. A clash in the sense that I wasn't his type of guy and I could
                    see that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, could you tell me about Richard Holbrooke, the new
                        assistant secretary. Now he is being touted as maybe being a candidate for
                        Secretary of State. But, he was controversial and I know he was not viewed
                        with any great enthusiasm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: No, he sees everything that the press has called him since he has gone
                    to Bosnia, that he is extremely intelligent, extremely creative, extremely
                    self-confident. But, at the same time, as Tom Friedman, yesterday in his foreign
                    affairs column in the “New York Times” said, he is a manically self-promoter,
                    which is true. In fact, during his tenure in EA there was an article in the
                    Washington Monthly about how his main concern was playing tennis with Teddy
                    Kennedy. So, this is not only my opinion by any means. But he is a very, very
                    talented guy. He was young, brash, extremely self-confident, 35 at the time I
                    believe, and he made a big splash.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can recall when he arrived in Seoul for the first time
                        all the dignitaries were out there and all and he appeared with a tennis
                        racket under his arm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Koreans don't go for that. They like their leaders to be very
                    austere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. This did not signify that he took the whole situation
                        very seriously in the Korean eyes. Well, tell me what was the clash?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I simply did not react fast enough for him. I was not a bellower by any
                    means. I can't remember the exact details, but at one point I hadn't done
                    something or sent something over to the White House in time, and it turned out
                    that that was a good thing because it was a bad recommendation from the
                    Department and was later junked. But, he had me up there and was pounding the
                    desk. So, finally what he did was to have Bill Gleysteen, who was the principal
                    DAS call me into his office one day and explain that Dick really wanted to have
                    somebody else in that job. I had been there when he arrived and he would have
                    moved me out but at that point he was being sort of kind, but now he wants to
                    make the move. He was shifting me over to be director for Australian/New Zealand
                    affairs. So, I spent my second year in EA in that job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be 1977-78?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Right. By the way one should mention the very increased attention to
                    human rights in Korea during the tenure of Pat Derian, who very frequently came
                    to EA meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about Pat Derian? How was she
                        viewed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, she was viewed as sort of an outsider who was coming in with these
                    off -the-wall ideas which were good ideas but inapplicable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any attempt to explain, for example, Korea and
                        the military situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, I'm sure there was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Korea a particular focus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: It was. We did have the problems of labor leaders, missionaries and
                    students. You also have the problem just prior to this, and this was before the
                    new administration came in, you had the scandals here with the KCIA and the
                    little envelops full of cash.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and it was called Koreagate too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Right. The defection of a KCIA officer here in Washington. So, that
                    further soured people on Korea. A lot of people, particularly in the new
                    administration, were prepared to think the worse. I think this may have played a
                    role in the decision to try to take the troops out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the Koreagate business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of things were you involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I was present during the interrogation of this guy who had defected.
                    Slapping the Koreans on the wrists when the whole thing hit the press. Of
                    course, no slap could be greater than that given in the American press. We
                    certainly didn't pooh-pooh it and say, “Carry on, don't worry about this.” We
                    made a big deal out of it. Now, maybe a greater deal would have been made if
                    Carter had been in at that point.</p>

                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, yes. As I say she came to the meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did coming to the meetings mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, that there was a new emphasis now on human rights and that we
                    would be a strong advocate of human rights and would call the Koreans' attention
                    to it when we felt they had done something wrong. I think the Koreans, for their
                    part, took it very seriously. They, as well, may have concluded that the troop
                    withdrawal rumblings were in part motivated by their internal moves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see from your perspective any movement on their
                        part?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: They never shut their door to this, never kept Congressman Fraser out,
                    for example. We did make representations and they listened to us. I think the
                    Koreans we dealt with knew what the problem was. At no point did they do what
                    the Soviets would do when you bring this up—it is an internal affair don't
                    bother us. They certainly knew they had to keep on the right side of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you are dealing with Korea from the desk, was their
                        any concern or reflections of the fact that there were some congressmen who
                        were practically on the Korean payroll, either through rice matters or
                        ....?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, but that wasn't an issue that we followed. I wasn't about to say
                    let's investigate Congressman X. No, that wasn't an issue in my time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you moved on to the Australian /New Zealand desk. In a
                        way this must have seemed like cold potatoes or something like that after
                        your previous jobs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, it was, but it was a new area entirely and sort of interesting.
                    There were a lot of things going on. Our relations with the South Pacific were
                    developing. It was hardly front page news, of course, but it did get me a trip
                    out there to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa. The issues involved with
                    Australia and New Zealand was New Zealand not letting US naval ships pay a port
                    of call unless we specified that they didn't have nuclear devices or anything
                    aboard. That finally evolved into New Zealand leaving ANZUS, I understand. Is
                    that right?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: At the time they had not. There was an ANZUS meeting here in my tenure
                    in Washington. It was an interesting tour but not a gripping one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Carter administration trying to be more flexible
                        with New Zealand on this nuclear issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, I think so. That was the bedrock of policy, you know, you don't
                    negotiate for hostages, which we probably do, and you don't acknowledge the
                    presence of nuclear weapons. We didn't deal in a cavalier way with New
                    Zealand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other administrations sometimes like to have a good
                        confrontation thing, but this wouldn't have been done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: No, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Australia? There is always the problem of our
                        involvement with various classified intelligence gatherings.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: The biggest thing, perhaps, was our ban on the importation of kangaroo
                    skins.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why, because kangaroos are cute?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, we considered them endangered, but of course the Australians
                    didn't because they were running all over the place. What else was a big issue?
                    One issue was Australian concerns about Americans pulling out of Asia. I think
                    they regarded Carter and this whole Korean pull out plan as a serious step on
                    the part of the United States to withdraw from Asia, and they were very unhappy
                    about that. We had to reassure them constantly. I remember, Robert Oakley, who
                    was the other DAS at the time in charge of Southeast Asia, Australia and New
                    Zealand, was supposed to go out and give a speech to some Australian foreign
                    affairs organization. He couldn't or didn't want to do it so he sent me. The
                    text that I developed was very big on the idea that we were not pulling out of
                    Asia, it was very important to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that Carter was trying to get disengaged from
                        Asia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: I think so. I think the Vietnam thing was still very warm and there was
                    always this fear that we would become embroiled in another war overseas. I think
                    this was still a strong impression. People have a lot of complaints about
                    Carter. Later when I got to the Soviet desk we saw them again in their reaction
                    to the invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything else we should talk about on Australia
                        and New Zealand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I can't think of anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, 1978, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I got a very severe back problem and had to go to the hospital and was
                    out of commission for really the bulk of 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move to 1979.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I went on the Soviet desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were back from a bit of floating around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Right. The Soviet desk was a part from Carter's reaction to the Afghan
                    incident, less effected by the new administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were on the Soviet desk from 1979 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Until 1982.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to the Afghan business, which is a major
                        turning point for Carter and all, could you talk about our relations with
                        the Soviet Union in 1979? This is a little further into the Carter
                        administration which was trying to have a new look towards the Soviet
                        Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: I don't recall any major change. I was deputy director for exchanges,
                    back on exchanges which were then going full blast. The first thing I did while
                    on the desk was to go to the Soviet Union with a big delegation under
                    Congressman Brademas, who at the time was Democratic Whip. There were all kinds
                    of exchanges going on at that point, just prior to Afghanistan. There were
                    parliamentary exchanges. We had the Soviet chairman of their supreme court. The
                    atmosphere was very congenial on all sides. Some of these exchanges were of real
                    practical value in health, space exploration, energy. Of course, Afghanistan
                    changed that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you finding the Soviet internal affairs section a
                        little more tolerant with exchanges prior to the Afghan business? Was their
                        a loosening up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Not tremendously. They operated with many of the same problems. Let me
                    give you an example. We were in the throes of negotiating a renewal of the
                    overall umbrella agreement, under which all these separate agreements fit, and
                    were trying to get things, for example, for exchange graduate students. We were
                    trying to have the Soviets open up the fields, the specialties, in which we
                    could send graduate students to. They almost never agreed and we hadn't reached
                    any agreement on this renewal either. In other words they wanted to keep people
                    either in pre-revolutionary fields or in technical fields. Someone could go over
                    and study botany, but he couldn't study mass media in the Soviet Union. You
                    couldn't study anything in the humanities after 1917. By the same token we
                    wanted their people to send people over who weren't just milking our technology
                    by studying very technical subjects. We wanted them to study subjects in the
                    humanities. They never agreed to that.</p>
                <p>Another point of concern to them and this sort of reflects traditional Soviet
                    approach, was to have a clause in the exchanges agreement which in effect would
                    require us to turn back to them anybody to had defected under the exchanges
                    program. There had been a number of ballerinas, etc. who had defected. So, we
                    wouldn't agree to that. Indeed I was in Moscow as head of the negotiating team
                    to try to renew the agreement in December 1979. We couldn't reach agreement on a
                    number of these issues and decided to adjourn around December 15 and then resume
                    after the New Year. Well, I left December 18, or so, and the Soviets invaded
                    Afghanistan on December 27th, so the whole deal was off.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>It turned out that much of my tenure on the Soviet desk as head of exchanges was
                    involved in dismantling the exchanges. We had the requisite task force after the
                    invasion and we were getting instructions from the White House as we would
                    react. Of course, you had the famous Carter reaction. He was very much
                    surprised. How could the Soviets do this? Some specific instructions from the
                    White House were also a little strange and were not in the last analysis to our
                    benefit. For example, the closing of our consulate, which hadn't gotten open
                    yet, but there was an advance team, in the Ukraine in Kiev. We did have a
                    consulate in Leningrad, but we felt it was important to have a consulate in
                    Kiev. We were told that this would be one of the steps and that we were to get
                    together on the desk and cook up other reactions. Well, these are all piddling
                    reactions and in the last analysis didn't help us very much, like shutting off a
                    lot of these exchanges. Maybe when there isn't much alternative that is what you
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of our first reactions to almost anything is an
                        embargo and 1) it doesn't work and 2) it gets us into more trouble in other
                        places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, we didn't have any third countries to worry about, but it did shut
                    off a lot of very useful exchanges. I always think we got a lot more out of
                    these exchanges than the Soviets did. Perhaps not on the technical side, but
                    without the agreement we couldn't get in, while the Soviets have access to our
                    press and our people and we have only the agreement to pry open a lot of these
                    institutions. So, it didn't do us any good. But, you are right, what else are we
                    going to do?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Don't stand there do something, you know. You mentioned
                        before the defection of some people, ballerinas, that you were involved
                        with. Can you explain how you were?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, there was the defection of this ballerina from the Bolshoi. I
                    think her name was Lasova. Her husband's name was Gudanov. They were both ballet
                    stars. It was a very interesting case. She was the one who defected in New York
                    and got into the hands of American authorities in New York. However, later she
                    said she wanted to go back. The Soviets agreed to have a meeting between her and
                    our side because she was physically in their custody again. So, I was sent from
                    the Soviet desk along with a guy from L (Legal Office) up to New York for an
                    interview in the presence of the Soviets of this woman. We landed at La Guardia
                    and called our UN mission which was handling this for the State Department. They
                    said they didn't know where she was. The Soviets hadn't yet set the meeting up.
                    I ran to one of the airline desks in La Guardia and asked them what Aeroflot's
                    schedule was departing from New York. They said that it was going to leave at
                    4:00 pm and it was then about 1:00 pm. So, we jumped into a cab and raced out to
                    La Guardia and it turned out indeed the woman had just been taken off to the
                    plane by the Soviets. She was sitting on the plane. At that point somebody else
                    was aware of this, I think it was the FBI, and they had stopped the plane from
                    leaving. So, there she was sitting on the plane and the Department wanted
                    somebody with a little more status than Hurwitz and called in David McHenry, our
                    UN ambassador. He negotiated with the Soviet UN ambassador in New York. It went
                    on for two or three days and the passengers stayed overnight on the plane at
                    least once. Finally it was arranged that on neutral territory, and the closest
                    we could come to neutral territory was one of these mobile lounges, we would
                    meet and have a psychiatrist from the Public Health Service, me, McHenry and an
                    interpreter from the Department. My Russian is good but I felt we really needed
                    a professional interpreter for this for nuances, etc. And, indeed the woman
                    wanted to go back and there was nothing in her demeanor or in anything that she
                    said to indicate otherwise. Meanwhile a couple of times I had gone out to the
                    parking lot where her husband was with none other than Joseph Brodsky, who was
                    then involved in this thing giving moral support to the husband. But, she left.
                    I don't know what ever happened to her. Gudanov went off to Hollywood and
                    appeared in a film. I don't know what has happened to him, he may have gone
                    back.</p>
                <p>That was one of the cases. There was another case in Los Angeles of a couple who
                    defected from the Bolshoi. It was happening a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Our policy was open and shut, the policy we have now. We are not
                    returning anybody against their will, but neither would be hold anybody against
                    their will and that was the issue here with that woman. I detected nothing to
                    indicate that she wanted to stay, nor did the psychiatrist see anything that
                    would indicate drugging or anything like that. But these were the issues that we
                    followed in those days. I remember in Los Angeles telling a Soviet consular guy
                    who had come down to San Francisco, “What sort of nonsense is this? Why are we
                    here? Why don't you just let them go?” I said that Bulgaria let their people
                    out, and they did. Bulgaria had a lot of circus performers, operatic singers.
                    They let them go and let them come back. But the Soviets made it a life and
                    death issue. Well, now they know that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up any reflections of this Soviet build
                        up to do something in Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I certainly wasn't. One of the things we were watching at the time were
                    sort of mutinies on the part of Afghans against the regime. The regime then was
                    Amin who had taken over from the guy he had killed, Taraki. Amin had been an
                    exchange student in the States, but what we didn't know, we always classified
                    Amin as being installed by the Soviets. What we miscalculated, I think, was the
                    Soviets viewed Amin as somewhat a threat. I think they even saw him, because of
                    his studying in the US, as perhaps an American plant. But, no, I don't think
                    anybody foresaw this at all. I don't know about the intelligence, I wasn't privy
                    to special intelligence reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even today it is a little bit murky why they did it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: We always thought it was a stupid move on their part and indeed it was
                    something that hastened the demise of the Soviet Union. It was something that
                    was totally unnecessary. That is another thing. We always regarded Afghanistan,
                    if not completely neutral as slightly tilting towards the Soviet Union. I went
                    back, in fact, and looked at FBIS and you can see speech after speech that Daud,
                    who was overthrown by Taraki, made tilting towards the Soviet Union. The Soviets
                    supplied all their military. The Soviets were in bed with their military. So, I
                    don't know what got into Brezhnev's mind. The way they handled it too was a
                    disaster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After they went in in Christmas time of 1979, all of a
                        sudden within the United States like whenever anything like this happens,
                        big red arrows were drawn on maps by political commentaries pointing toward
                        the Persian Gulf and all. By those who were dealing with the Soviets and
                        trying to figure out what the hell they were up to, ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>At that time what was the thinking of why the Soviets did what they did in
                    Afghanistan?</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, to my recollection it was not necessarily a drive to warm water
                    ports, or something like that. It was more an extension of the Brezhnev
                    doctrine. That in retrospect they had some real concerns about Amin and where
                    Afghanistan was heading. This might have been a move to head off a move by Amin
                    to bring Afghanistan closer to the West, which would have meant that they had on
                    their borders a problem. Certainly from Brezhnev's standpoint they would have
                    seen it that way. Brezhnev had given us the Brezhnev doctrine in respect to
                    Czechoslovakia. Of course, they weren't about to do anything with China,
                    although they were in constant friction with them along the border. Their
                    European borders, with the exception of Finland, were totally secured. And their
                    arrangement with Finland was very secure. Now, Afghanistan could have in their
                    terms represented a problem, one they were fully confident they could solve.
                    They thought they could pull this off in a matter of days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have talked to Jim Bishop who was there as political
                        counselor, and he said they were trying to figure out and the Afghans were
                        trying to figure out why the Soviets were in there. They felt they might be
                        supporting the Amin government at first.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, it was terrible intelligence on their part, terrible misjudgment
                    and terrible lack of real knowledge of what their interests should be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time did you find that there was a conflict
                        with the NSC, whose head at that time was Brzezinski, who was always seeing
                        perfidious plots on the part of the Soviets, because of his anti-Russian,
                        pro-Polish bias? Did you feel the NSC was trying to push us as far as we
                        could go?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: No, I don't think so. We chalked a lot of the reaction up to Carter's
                    sense of, perhaps, disillusionment. He had been disillusioned before, under
                    false allusions before, tending to trust people. He said something to the effect
                    that he was surprised.</p>

                <p>HURWITZ: I don't think so.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: No, I think we viewed Afghanistan as something quite a part, strictly
                    Soviets. Nobody was attributing what was happening in Iran to the Soviets at any
                    point as far as I recall. I think Afghanistan was viewed as something very
                    special for the Soviets.</p>

                        out ways we can be nasty to the Soviets?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Absolutely. We drew up charts. Mark Parris drew up a very neat chart
                    showing what we could do and how we could do it with a time table. Yes, we
                    definitely were ordered to sit around and brain storm in a group to figure out
                    what we could do that would hurt them and most desirably not hurt us. But, in a
                    lot of cases we couldn't come up with something that wouldn't hurt us as well.
                    The closing of Kiev is a good case in point.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, those were private terms. We definitely didn't want to interfere
                    with the commercial ventures. This was part of the game to figure out something
                    that would hurt them a lot but not hurt us, and this was hard to do. One thing
                    we didn't want to do was to interfere with the commercial side.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Olympics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, we boycotted the Olympics.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling that this wasn't....?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Not on the desk, I think we all went along with boycotting the Olympics.
                    I don't remember any of us being any great sports fan or in any way enamored
                    with the Olympic principle. I think it probably was a good thing. I don't like
                    the Olympics much myself.</p>
                <p>One thing, by the way, in 1980, on the Olympics, the Soviets came to the winter
                    Olympics in 1980. Did they or did they not, I can't recall. At any rate, we were
                    concerned that there would be defections from any number of Eastern bloc
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were they held?</hi>

                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Up in Lake Placid. So, they wanted somebody up there who had some
                    experience in handling defections so they sent me up, which was very nice. I
                    stayed in lovely quarters. They had a regular FBI team up there and myself and
                    we didn't get any defections. But, that was the name of the game in that era,
                    defections. But, of course, they boycotted Los Angeles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You stayed there until 1982. When the Reagan
                        administration came in was there a change as far as exchanges were concerned
                        and attitude towards the Soviet Union at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: No. The FBI was playing its usual game of trying to keep Soviets out,
                    but the reaction to the Soviet Union, bilateral relations, really was not very
                    different during the time I was on the desk. I know that Reagan came in and
                    talked about the evil empire, but even he did as much with Russians in a sense
                    as Nixon did with China. I can't recall what kind of opposition there was to
                    Star Wars, for example. I don't think there much at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well a lot of this came later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I am saying that if you want to take an issue where Reagan had a
                    different point of view, his view really wasn't much different than the general
                    view of the Soviet Union, which was part and parcel of our policy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it you were carrying on until 1982?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it mainly shutting down meaning there wasn't much

                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: A lot was shut down, but we did let a lot go through in the last
                    analysis. We picked and chose. Those exchanges which we felt we liked and were
                    as apolitical as you could get— health, environmental protection—they went
                    forward pretty much. The larger, big ticket issues like the Bolshoi Ballet, no,
                    that was stopped. But, some exchanges kept going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought we might stop at this point and pick up next
                        time when you left the Soviet desk in 1982. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I went to Afghan language training.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we will pick it up at that point.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is September 6, 1996. Let's talk a bit...do they
                        call it Afghan or Farsi language training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: They called it Dari. I got to Afghanistan and found that absolutely
                    nobody used the word Dari, they all called it Farsi. This was an attempt to
                    create a language which really was not different at all from Persian Farsi. The
                    accent yes, and certain words, but it was basically South Carolina versus
                    Boston.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I took what was called Serbo-Croatian, it was pure
                        Serbian. I picked up an awful lot about the Serb mentality and the Serb
                        outlook from my teachers at the Foreign Service Institute. When you were
                        taking Dari did you get much of a feeling about Afghans and their outlook
                        from your teachers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, I had only one teacher and I was the only student. He was very
                    nice and is still here. He was a very good teacher and treated me very kindly
                    having me at his house a couple of times, arranged to go out around the town
                    with me just to keep me talking, and introduced me to a lot of his friends. I
                    later found out, though, that he was not typical of all Afghans. If you really
                    wanted to learn something about the Mujahideen, you couldn't get it through his
                    sort of ethnic background. He was Afghan, yes, but he was I believe of Uzbek
                    nationality, a pure Persian speaker, not a Pashtun speaker at all. When I got to
                    Afghanistan it was quite clear that the differences in mentality, in outlook,
                    and the differences in martial characteristics were very distinct, very
                    noticeable. The Pashtuns, who were bearing the brunt of the struggle against the
                    Soviets, were very different, very much warlike, different basically from the
                    city dwelling Uzbeks or Tajiks who made up the population of Kabul. I am not
                    saying it was irrelevant by any means, but it was less relevant to what we were
                    really tracking which was the course of the resistance, the prospects of the
                    resistance. So, to answer your question, yes, I got a good insight into this
                    particular segment of Afghan culture, but none into the other, and I don't know
                    how you could overcome that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Afghanistan from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I arrived in June, 1983 and left in February, 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Afghanistan in June, 1983 when
                        you arrived and what had you been prepared to see and picking up from the
                        desk before you went out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, the war was going on. Brezhnev had died and Andropov was very ill,
                    so the Soviets had not yet shifted gears on Afghanistan, they were going full
                    blast. I think the situation differed in my view than what the desk was talking
                    in the sense I saw and reported this in very negative style in a cable, a much
                    more gloomy outlook for Afghanistan then the story that was coming out of
                    Washington. Now, the story that was coming out of Washington to a great extent
                    was propelled by saying what we wanted to hear on the one hand and saying
                    something that was really useful at the same time, and that is that the
                    resistance is very strong. It is disunified, but perhaps there will be attempts
                    to unify it and then succeed. In any event they are giving the Soviets a very
                    hard time.</p>
                <p>My view, when I got there, was that the Soviets were really dug in. That the
                    opposition, resistance, and this was a view that was only strengthened and
                    confirmed to me as time went on, was incredibly disunified, squabbling among
                    themselves, and that there was on cause for optimism. In fact, I did a calendar
                    year end telegram, titled something to like, “The Soviets Were Settling Down or
                    Digging In.” Of course, later, two major changes occurred. Gorbachev came in in
                    March 1985 and in a speech described Afghanistan as a bleeding wound. And the
                    second major change was the supplying of the Mujahideen with the stinger
                    rockets, which really curtailed the usefulness of the main Soviet weapon in
                    Afghanistan, the helicopter. It turns out that my assessment, not knowing what
                    was coming down the pike on these two elements, was wrong. As events turned out,
                    the Soviets pulled out.</p>
                <p>However, one crucial part of my assessment turned out to be very correct and that
                    is that the opposition would not unify. They were very seriously divided, having
                    other things on their mind a part from just winning a war. This was clear
                    because things were happening in Kabul and elsewhere that made it very clear
                    this was no way to fight a war, the way they were doing it. Supplies were coming
                    into Kabul, there was all kinds of commerce. The opposition, the Mujahideen and
                    various groups, were letting this happen because they would be taking bribes. In
                    other words you would have a Mujahideen group in control of one particular
                    section of a road and you would have supplies coming in which the Soviets needed
                    and which had they been cut off would have strangled Kabul, the only
                    administrative unit that meant anything at that time. Yet, the goods and fuel
                    came through and commerce continued. The market in Kabul was awash with all
                    kinds of consumer goods. You could buy Japanese radios, German refrigerators,
                    automobiles. My point is that the Mujahideen didn't cut this off. Each group was
                    more interested in building up its own strength and reserves. They didn't think
                    of the war in national terms, but in terms of their individual group.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>There is one very interesting point on this score. I had a small Sony shortwave
                    radio and I used to twirl the dial trying to pick up VOA and BBC in Farsi. I
                    would pick it up and report it. I found out that every now and then, as I zeroed
                    in on frequencies, you could hear local shortwave radio/telephone. They didn't
                    have regular telephone lines and there was no such thing as mail, and you could
                    hear these individual outfits talking to each other...”the truck is coming
                    through and everything is fine, we took care of the payment.” I reported on this
                    as well as an indication that this is not a real war. I always used to raise the
                    analogy of Vietnam back in Washington arguing with people who were drumming up
                    this optimistic viewpoint, which was fine from a public relations standpoint,
                    but not if we were deluding ourselves. I would say, “You know, these people
                    aren't fighting like the North Vietnamese fought. They could have won the war
                    two years ago if they had decided to do that, or could have done that.”</p>
                <p>What it comes down to is that we see in the aftermath of Afghanistan that you
                    don't have a unified resistance and it is no longer a resistance, they won. But,
                    they are still at each other's throat. So, that part of my assessment was
                    correct. The basic part about having reason to think that the Soviets would pull
                    out, I was wrong, but for reasons that I don't think anybody foresaw at the
                    time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in 1983, what was the situation as far as
                        where you lived and where you worked? What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: The main function at the embassy, I should point out, really was to keep
                    in touch, however we could, with the Mujahideen. I won't say that we really had
                    direct contact with them, we didn't. And, I can't recall a single instance where
                    there was such contact. Our major product was to keep tabs on the war. We did
                    this by going around town. Lee Coldren was at the embassy at that time, an old
                    Afghan hand, who was an inveterate antique and rug buyer. He had a lot of
                    contacts from a previous tour. I would go one way and he would go another way
                    around town, and we would talk to people. A lot of people were very interested
                    in getting out stories of a battle in Herat or a skirmish just north of Kabul.
                    We collated this stuff and did a weekly cable, a sitrep, it was called. This was
                    a long cable which basically catalogued everything we picked up during the week.
                    Now, here again the purpose was to report on this war, which was pretty well
                    isolated from the world. We did have an occasional Western correspondent going
                    in or listening from Peshawar, something like that. But, largely the war wasn't
                    getting all that much attention. Our function was just to get this news out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your job was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I was Charg�. And there is a whole story connected with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, let's hear it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: The story is that as you know after this April revolution of 1978 you
                    had a pro-Soviet government that wanted to come in and introduce all kinds of
                    horrendous, from the Muslim standpoint, reforms—land reforms, putting women into
                    schools, etc. This really was pretty good, but the Afghans weren't having much
                    part of it. There were all kinds of strange groups at that time. I don't think
                    it has ever been satisfactorily answered, but one of them kidnaped and killed
                    Spike Dubs, who was the ambassador. After that we, of course, drew down the
                    embassy. Up to that time the embassy was an enormous thing. The AID mission was
                    enormous. There were perhaps a 1000 AID people, families and employees in the
                    Helmand Valley where we had a big irrigation project. We had enormous property.
                    We had cars all over the place, schools, commissaries. USIS had its own
                    compound. And, of course, there was a complete drawdown by the time I got there.
                    The embassy was only 18 people, including six marine guards. Most of the big
                    embassy was build in 1963 or 1967. It had big grounds with an athletic field.
                    That was simply occupied by a very few officers. The USIS operation was closed
                    including an enormous, beautiful USIS library. I don't know where the books are
                    now. So we were a small, besieged band, you might say. No families, of course.
                    The only way in and out was Air India from New Delhi. There definitely was a
                    feeling of being besieged. There were nightly rocket attacks. However, none of
                    the Americans really felt threatened, we were not the bad guys, and the law of
                    averages was certainly on your side. So, it wasn't particularly dangerous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the Afghan government at that time and what
                        sort of dealings did we have with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: The Afghan government was communist, the first secretary of the Party
                    and also the president was Babrak Karmal. He was an early revolutionary even
                    under Daud before the so-called April Revolution of 1978 had been brought in by
                    the Soviets right after their invasion. In fact, the plan was to have him sort
                    of right on the tail of it. They had hoped to be able to either kill or capture
                    the guy who was then in charge, Hafizullah Amin, but that job the Soviet police,
                    the ministry of interior people, botched to the extent that the guy who was in
                    charge of the operation, the first deputy minister of the interior, while being
                    taken back to the Soviet Union, committed suicide on an Aeroflot plane on the
                    way. The botched bit was killing Amin too soon so he couldn't hand over the
                    reigns of power to Babrak Karmal. It was all faked, of course. Anyway Babrak
                    Karmal was a creature of the Soviets.</p>
                <p>So, he was in power. We, of course, never dealt with the government outside of
                    the protocol section of the foreign ministry. The protocol chief was a very
                    cultured guy, he didn't speak Russian. He had spent many years in the US and was
                    always embarrassed about what was going on about him, but, of course, couldn't
                    do anything. So, that was the only point of contact that we had.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it ever contemplated at that point, either by the
                        Afghans, as far as you know, or by us, to close down our mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: No, that issue never really came up. Our justification for staying there
                    was adequate. Basically it was that our staying did not involve recognition of
                    the Afghan government, only recognizes our continuing relationship with the
                    Afghan people. I never presented credentials. As a matter of fact my going to
                    Afghanistan is a long story and I will only give you part of it. We always felt
                    that the Afghans, themselves, would turn down visa applications, so when I was
                    sent there we never told them that I would be charg�, for one thing. We just
                    asked for a visa for me. So, I went in and we never sent a note to the Afghans
                    saying I had arrived in any capacity. We sort of tried to have it both ways and
                    I think we basically succeeded having a presence there which we felt it was
                    necessary to do, and also to show the Afghan people that the West cared. So, it
                    worked out. They let me in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am so used to the conventional things like when you have
                        somebody arrested or you have to get something cleared, or there is a vote
                        in the UN, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: We never dealt with them on any issues except our survival. I can't
                    recall any complaints we made to them. We really didn't treat them as a
                    government. I mean our survival as an embassy. For example, at one point a
                    Soviet soldier had defected, managing to get into the front door of the embassy
                    and was there for a couple of days. Immediately the Soviets surrounded the place
                    with Afghan troops while Soviet troops were in the background. I went to the
                    protocol guy in the foreign ministry and complained to him. That was the sort of
                    thing we did. When a Soviet helicopter was hovering over the embassy, we think
                    to try to take pictures of our communications stuff on the roof, I again went to
                    the foreign ministry and complained. At one point Soviet aircraft, the airport
                    was quite close to the embassy, landing or taking off would drop flares to
                    divert heat seeking missiles as they landed and took off. A lot of these flares
                    would hit the embassy grounds, a number setting some dry grass on fire. So, I
                    fired off notes to the Soviets and went to the foreign ministry. So, it wasn't a
                    normal embassy in the sense that you make a demarche about an issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You raised the subject of a Soviet soldier defecting. How
                        did that work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, he stayed a number of days. A nice young kid. And, then we did
                    what we always do. I knew Russian very well at the time and I talked to him. He
                    decided on his own that he wanted to go back. I said, “All right, we will have
                    to do this. We will have the Soviet ambassador come and have a meeting.” I gave
                    the young man a couple of days to think it over. The Soviet ambassador came and
                    sat down with his aide and myself, the embassy Agency guy and this kid. He said
                    he would like to go back, plain and simple like that. We gave him his AK47 which
                    he had brought in and he was on his way. I don't know what happened to him. He
                    was probably sent off to prison but undoubtedly released soon after Gorbachev
                    came in. In fact this may have been in 1985 when Gorbachev was already in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you didn't have meaningful contact with the Afghan
                        government, what about with the Soviets. They were sort of the pro-consul
                        and you spoke Russian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I spoke frequently with the Soviets. I can't recall that I talked about
                    why they were there, etc., although I may have. I did call on the Soviet
                    ambassador and that sort of thing. He was an immovable real apparatchnik. He had
                    been a very high official, the first secretary of the Tartar autonomous
                    republic. He wasn't the type that you would talk to about maybe you were doing
                    the wrong thing, nor would he give a bit of information. He was a pleasant
                    enough guy, but nobody who you could talk seriously to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Soviet military forces
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I did a lot of walking around town and they were all over. My impression
                    was that they were bad. Everything that we see now in Chechnya, you saw a bit of
                    then. We had a Soviet military hospital directly across the street so you could
                    see these guys going in and out. I didn't talk to many of those. There was
                    graffiti written on the walls. I remember one that had to do with _________. The
                    guy said, “I would rather be home digging ditches in ___________.” And then you
                    saw them in the marketplace very shabbily dressed. There was a lot of drinking.
                    Their main purpose in Afghanistan apart from avoiding action, was to go if
                    possible to the market and buy these things that I just talked about—the Sony
                    Walkmen, the tape recorders and tapes. Little shops were filled with pirated
                    Russian language tapes of Russian dissident singers who were very popular
                    because you couldn't buy them in the Soviet Union. Of course, to buy anything
                    they needed money and, of course, they were very badly paid. So, they sold
                    whatever they could get. Gasoline from their jeeps. We had to get rid of one
                    Marine who was involved in giving a couple bottles of Scotch to some soldier in
                    exchange for the guy's AK47. The food shops were filled with caviar. We would
                    buy caviar, 4 ozs, for a dollar. In fact, one of the communicators, had sent
                    home two or three footlockers full of caviar.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>Again, on this issue of Soviets selling things to get money, and this was before
                    the days of the crumbling Berlin Wall when this became common, just before I had
                    gotten there there had been a little flood in the embassy basement. Stored in
                    the basement at the time was the unaccompanied baggage of the previous security
                    officer. As a favor to the guy they took these footlockers out of the water and
                    opened them up so that anything inside would dry out. They found them full of
                    Soviet uniforms. We wondered what was going on. Then, a little later, the
                    successor to this security officer, received a letter from “Soldier of Fortune”
                    magazine. They had received his last shipment and were waiting for more. There
                    was a big market for the uniforms. Well, the guy got into a lot of trouble. This
                    was going on. This is what the Soviets were doing. They were really disheveled,
                    slovenly, no military baring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any reports about how they were
                        conducting themselves on the battlefield?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: No, we were not. I can't recall anything specific along those lines.
                    But, I have no reason to believe they distinguished themselves in organization
                    or valor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is interesting because it is still a time when in the
                        United States, despite the fact that people on the ground were seeing this,
                        they were still being described as ten feet tall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I can't ever remember pointing this out in a cable. I probably didn't.
                    But, that was not the feeling from those who had seen it. Here again, the
                    embassy was located on the main street going to the airport and part of our
                    portfolio, so to speak, was to watch these convoys as they went by. They were
                    just a bad looking group. A tank or an armored personnel carrier would pass by
                    and guys would be lying on it with shirts off, etc. You don't expect them to be
                    spruced up in a battle area, but on the other hand there was no evidence of
                    discipline. They were in many ways a lot like the troops that were in Chechnya.
                    They were conscripts, morale was low, and they seemed to be poorly trained.</p>

                        whom you had contact? If so, what were you getting from them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, we didn't have any contact with fighters, so to speak. We had
                    contact with merchants, travelers, businessmen, who had been in the area. So, we
                    never directly discussed what different factions wanted. We kept reporting on it
                    because it was a matter of record and almost a matter of course that there were
                    these groups...Massoud, just north of Kabul, a Tajik, Persian talking group and
                    the groups around Qandahar which were Pushtuns and never the twain would meet.
                    That was all obvious then. Our line was that they would sort this out among them
                    and we kept pushing and pushing, but without success. But the fault lines were
                    very clear and noticeable. You could have troops, and this happened once I
                    recall around Qandahar in the east near Pakistan, being assaulted by a major
                    Soviet push to eliminate a group, and if the large and very, very effective
                    force under the direction of Massoud just north of Kabul had just gone behind
                    the Soviets and attacked them from the rear it would have had an effect. But
                    Massoud wouldn't move to help the Pushtuns. And I have talked to a Pushtun in
                    Pakistan and mentioned this to him but he said it wouldn't have mattered because
                    the Tajiks couldn't fight. Even if they had come up behind the Soviets nothing
                    would have happened, they would have run away. So, there was this constant
                    bickering, which has turned into deadly combat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when we started introducing stingers into
                        Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware that this was going to happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: From the press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Soviets making noises about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: I can't recall whether they did or not. Certainly not to me directly. Of
                    course, the Soviet line when you did discuss the situation was “Why are you
                    helping these criminals, these gangster?” They pointed to Babrak Karmal and
                    said, “Look, you have a man here who is interested in the welfare of the people.
                    Schools are operating, little boys are taught how to read, girls are going to
                    school. Health care is being made more available.” I must say in Kabul, as I
                    look back on this later, there was a lot in what was happening that we would
                    have had as a country no objection to. More equality for women, more education,
                    a reduced role for religion in public life, a little bit more fairness in
                    distribution of the goodies that society produces. I put these things in writing
                    to the Department. I wrote about how the people of Kabul, which were basically
                    the people I had daily and direct contact with, have very little problem with
                    the kind of society that was developing and that they were as much afraid, if
                    not more afraid, of what would happen if you had these groups coming in and
                    taking charge. I recall in one cable sent towards the end of my tour having been
                    in Kabul almost three years, I said that I had not seen one “Russki Go Home”
                    sign. I had not seen one work stoppage. I had not seen one act of animosity
                    towards a Soviet soldier. The merchants were eager to sell to the soldiers. Now
                    you did have acts of violence but they were set up by Mujahideen who infiltrated
                    from time to time. There were a couple of bombs that went off in
                    restaurants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about newspapers, media, Americans and others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: There was nothing available, although VOA came through fairly well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about representatives of American media?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: None whatsoever. The only American, who was not media but a serious
                    observer, was Sig Harrison, who has written on Korea and Afghanistan. I think at
                    that time he was associated with Brookings or something like that. But, he was
                    the only visitor I remember coming in. Oh, the Baltimore “Sun” got someone in
                    once. He happened to be Finnish but a Baltimore “Sun” correspondent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Soviet rule was in place where you could see it and
                        the Soviet role was not particularly oppressive. Our policy was to build
                        essentially a backfire against this. How did you feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: I think the over all goal of having the Soviets leave was absolutely
                    correct. Let me just step back a little. If the Afghans were not Afghans but
                    let's say Polish or some other little bit more excitable group, I'm speaking
                    basically about the Tajik, the Persian speakers, who were by far the majority in
                    Kabul, then I think you would have seen more resistance. It gives the wrong
                    impression to say this was really benign. They simply accommodated very well. I
                    am not sure any other group would have accommodated.</p>
                <p>Getting back to our overall policy. I thought our over all policy of somehow
                    opposing it was right. As I say in the beginning I was pessimistic that we could
                    really pull it off because the opposition was so terribly disunified and at each
                    other's throats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One time when the Soviets went in in December, 1979, in
                        the States you were looking at maps showing arrows pointing down towards the
                        Persian Gulf and all that. Had we figured out what they were doing
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: My best guess is that it was really a result of some sclerotic thinking
                    on an aging Kremlin. It was the stupidest move they could have made. I, in fact,
                    went back to old FBISs from about the time they went in or just before and in
                    statement after statement everything the king of Afghanistan, Daud, who later
                    became prime minister, said was completely neutral vis-a-vis the Soviets or the
                    Americans. Or, it was indeed tilting towards the Soviets. Their military was
                    almost totally supplied by the Soviets. The Soviets were infiltrating all over
                    the place over the years. They had had a long, long relationship with
                    Afghanistan going back to pre-revolutionary days. So, what was developing at the
                    time was even more acceptable to the Soviets than their relationship with
                    Finland in a sense. What did trouble them was that after Taraki was killed,
                    Hafizullah Amin came in and they were very suspicious of him because he had been
                    an exchange student in the States. They may have felt that he was getting out of
                    hand. But, there would have been ways of handling that without invading the
                    country and getting so mired down in this thing. It was simply a mistake. I
                    don't think the question of moving beyond Afghanistan came into their minds.</p>
                <p>Now, another element of miscalculation may have been that they thought we were
                    moving in, which was the furthest thing from our minds. The real solution to the
                    Afghan problem was to leave it. Who was that senator from Vermont, Aiken, the
                    one who said about Vietnam, “Declare victory and leave.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Benign neglect.</hi>

                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, and let this place slide into the oblivion which it so richly
                    deserves. But, nowhere could that be said more aptly than about Afghanistan. So,
                    I think it was just a gross miscalculation on its part. I think Gorbachev
                    realized that. Gorbachev could have turned up the heat a great deal. They really
                    hadn't put that much into it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They really hadn't. It was just enough to get them in
                        trouble but not enough to get them out of trouble.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, that's right. It was a lot like Vietnam in a sense. Well, we did
                    put a lot more into Vietnam than they did there. We had 500,000 men there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, they had 100,000.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, something like that. And our casualties were greater. The bases
                    that we set up and the logistics that were evolved. Well, it was a terrible
                    mistake on their part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I left in February, 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing a change in the Soviet Union at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, they were beginning to feel out the UN which was beginning to be
                    involved in negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see the Soviets being able to pull out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, to declare a victory and leave, that sort of thing. Here again
                    nobody could identify what was at stake for them. Nobody really thought about
                    it. They had nothing really to lose except face.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the negotiations were going on what were you getting
                        from the people in Kabul?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Nothing. On the ground it just continued. There was no sign while I was
                    there that things were letting up.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel about your reporting to the desk?
                        Was the desk wanting you to say things that you didn't want to say? Taking
                        stands that you didn't feel was justified?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I never got much feedback. I know the Agency was not happy. And, I know
                    INR was not happy either. I came back on consultation and got some complaints
                    from INR that I was taking too gloomy a view. But, nobody ever put anything on
                    paper and it didn't particularly hurt my career in any way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we able to monitor what was happening to our AID
                        projects or were they just sort of write-offs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Outside of Kabul they were write-offs, you couldn't leave. I don't know
                    what happened to all of this obvious infrastructure that we had in Helmand
                    Valley. Before I went there we had negotiated the sale of a school that we
                    owned. But, everything else was at a complete standstill and we couldn't monitor
                    it. We had about 18 people at the embassy which included 2 guys from NSA, 2 guys
                    from the Agency, 6 marines, a security/admin officer, a GSO, a female secretary,
                    two reporting officers, a political officer/DCM and myself, the Charg�. So, we
                    couldn't get around very much.</p>
                <p>What I did see in terms of US infrastructure or projects was, for example, about
                    20 cars rusting away, trucks, this whole USIS complex, food from the commissary
                    that we had to bury so that people couldn't get their hands on it, tons of
                    whiskey and beer.</p>
                <p>Indeed I recall once when I was in Kyrgyzstan, Dick Moose came out in August,
                    1993. This was the time when we were just getting geared up in Kyrgyzstan having
                    opened in February, 1992 but didn't get fully started until l got there in
                    March, 1992. By that time people were thinking of building a big embassy and I
                    said to Moose, “Look, I feel very much influenced by my Afghan experience. You
                    really have to wait and see what a country is going to develop into what our
                    relations really should be, what our interests are, before we start putting a
                    lot of stuff on the ground.” For some reason we poured billions into Afghanistan
                    over the years all for nought. That was one lesson I think we have since learned
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for three years and must have gone out or

                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, it is very interesting, I think the marines loved it. There was
                    always a bit of excitement not knowing what was going to happen next. I went
                    around town being interested in what was going on. One of my real sources of
                    enjoyment, I would go about three times a week, was to go to the local used book
                    market. I would find the most interesting things from the Soviet standpoint and
                    send them in or buy books for the Library of Congress. I got a commendation from
                    the Library of Congress. In fact I got a $1000 award for what I did. Finding
                    things like Soviet classified military manuals on sale. The guy selling them
                    couldn't read Russian nor Farsi, he was basically illiterate. You would buy them
                    by the pound. I found one military manual in a junkyard. I sent it in and later
                    got feedback from the Agency. It was a manual on how they updated certain
                    aspects of the MI-8 helicopter. Now the Agency had gotten the MIA manual but
                    this showed what they had done with the civilian version to make it military.
                    They were very pleased with that. But, I found a certain degree of excitement in
                    this. And, there was always the rug buying. Afghan had been considered one of
                    the world traveler's objectives in the '70s. A lot of people overdosed on
                    drugs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was part of that drug route.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Right. A lot of tourists went there because this was excitement, the
                    silk route. There were shops where rugs were continued to be made because they
                    had nothing else to do, the war wasn't affecting them. They all came into Kabul
                    but there were no tourists to buy, so we would go shopping for rugs.</p>
                <p>There was one restaurant which was located in a big Intercontinental Hotel which
                    had at most two guests a day in it. We would take the pouch out to New Delhi
                    which was sort of scary. First of all there was no radar in Kabul and very steep
                    mountains ringed the city so you could get into trouble if you don't have visual
                    contact. And then there were shooting of rockets every now and then which
                    brought down a couple of planes.</p>
                <p>It was a post that had enough excitement so it never got boring. There was a
                    fairly active diplomatic community. The NATO countries were there as well as
                    Pakistan, Egypt, Japan. We had friendly relations with quite a few embassies and
                    there was a lot of socializing. There was a very strict 10:00 pm curfew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was not a bad idea. It gets you home on time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Right. The dinners began at 6:30 pm and were over at 9:15 pm and your
                    were gone.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had a curfew when I was in Korea and loved it. It
                        brought our teenage kids home and we didn't have to stay out late.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. I did a lot of reading.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left did somebody replace you in more or less the
                        same manner?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. However, the guy who replaced me didn't last very long and he then
                    was replaced by the guy who closed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left in 1986?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. The last Soviet troops left in February, 1987 and we closed it
                    because with the departure of the Soviet troops all hell broke loose, as anybody
                    could have predicted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like a terrible mess today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: It is a mess. What happened in the embassy is very interesting. The
                    front door was welted shut, we kept paying all the local employees. Indeed,
                    about three months ago, the FSN of the Year was an FSN from Afghanistan. He
                    managed to come out. I met him in his hotel room here and we had a long talk
                    about what is going on. He somehow goes to Peshawar and manages to find his way
                    with help through the mountains, picks up money (dollars I assume) and brings it
                    back in and pays the staff. For doing this he got the award. He says the embassy
                    is still all right. Nobody has bothered with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, in 1986 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I came back here and was in the so-called Capstone course run by the
                    military out at Bowling Air Field. It is a course that the Pentagon runs for
                    newly promoted flag officers. In other words for guys promoted from colonel or
                    Navy captains to admiral. State had just become involved in this the previous
                    year. One State guy participates. It is a three month course and I found it very
                    useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there more to add the foreign affairs
                        element?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. It was extremely useful for them. They were very interested in my
                    experiences throughout the course.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Then I took a Russian refresher course having been assigned as consul general to
                    Leningrad. I went out to Leningrad in September, 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Leningrad from 1986 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: September to end of August, 1988.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got to the Soviet Union this 1986-88 period, what
                        changes did you find from your previous tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, I had been there in 1981 for two months as acting political
                    counselor, and then I went back in 1982 for a month as acting political
                    counselor, so it wasn't as if I hadn't been there since 1972 when I last left. I
                    had also made a number of trips with congressional delegations while I was on
                    the Soviet desk. In 1986 if you read the press carefully you could see it was
                    much more open, but on the ground there was very little difference, if any. It
                    did begin in Leningrad, in fact, Leningrad was the spawning ground of a movement
                    that later became very important. What began in Leningrad was a kind of real
                    grass roots, organizational kinds of public activity in opposition to the
                    government in one way or another. I remember I was walking along the street one
                    Saturday and I saw down one side street a lot of young people, a big group.
                    There was a guy on a truck with a camera and I thought they were filming a
                    picture, which they often do in Leningrad because it is an old city. It turned
                    out from the press that this was a group of young people, environmentalists,
                    architectural historians, who were demonstrating to preserve one of the old
                    buildings that was going to be torn down. I later wrote in a cable describing
                    this because it was so unusual in the Soviet Union. I said that this had to be
                    organized with complete sanctions from the government, but let the group try to
                    demonstrate on other issues. Well, it wasn't officially sanctioned. It turned
                    out to be something that caught fire in Leningrad, the preservation of the old
                    buildings, and spread to such issues as factories that were spewing out
                    pollution. You found groups demonstrating around factories. There were rather
                    large Jewish demonstrations in Leningrad. The Moscow press covered the first
                    demonstration I had seen. In time these groups took on a life of their own. They
                    began to be called informally, “not formal,” and you began to get interviews in
                    the press. This really did mark a change and is something that never stopped.
                    Indeed, it went into areas that no government would be pleased about. There were
                    anti-Semitic groups which had their own demonstrations. There was a bubbling
                    up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel there was a lack of will on the part of the
                        authorities for sitting on these people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: No, no. It was clear that the Soviets had made a conscious decision to
                    let this go forward. And as Gorbachev sort of defined what he was doing, it
                    became clear that this was very conscious, and I think on his part quite
                    calculated. He wanted to instill life into the system and he realized you can't
                    do this by fear from above. You have to bubble up from the bottom. I believe he
                    realized you are not going to get to where you want to go without having people
                    be creative. Without having people bring to the public's attention issues that
                    have to be solved. Basically the Party is not interested in solving a lot of
                    issues, they want to let things go as they are. People are watching their own
                    goodies, their own perks, and don't want to rock the boat. This means you are
                    just going to fall further and further backward. He realized you have to let
                    these problems come to the fore before you can deal with them. This process
                    continued.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you beginning to see an either disquiet or concern
                        among the Soviet intellectuals by the growth of easier communications within
                        the West, with word processing, faxes, etc.? It was rapidly changing how
                        people do things in the Western world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: It wasn't specifically put on those terms, but there was a growing
                    realization that they were falling further and further behind. Just before I
                    went out I read a report done by a group of academics from the Academy of
                    Sciences, social scientists, and they were very much aware of how much the
                    Soviets were falling behind in terms of ideas. And this, of course, is one of
                    the things that helped bring everything down. The Soviets realized that to go
                    forward you had to plug into the West, you couldn't keep computers out. People
                    would get them one way or another. The trend was not to keep things tamped down
                    like they had for decades, but if they wanted to move forward they would just
                    have to open up. They had no choice. The late-''80s were the beginning of
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, 1986-88, which was towards the end of
                        the Reagan administration, had you sensed a change in the administration's
                        attitude towards the Soviet Union at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I think Reagan sort of moved from evil empire to a fairly businesslike
                    approach to the Soviets. I think he started, and certainly Bush carried out, a
                    policy which I thought was very sound. That is not to jump on the Soviets at
                    every turn, let Gorbachev develop in the way he wants to, because basically that
                    is in our interest. As you recall, Bush took a lot of heat later that Gorbachev
                    hadn't supported the break up of the Soviet Union fast enough. Leaping into
                    something like that and saying, “Hurrah, go to it!” would have been dangerous I
                    think. It could have created some concerns within the Soviet Union that what was
                    happening was only playing into the hands of the West.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find our contact with the local authorities,
                        the mayor, local parties, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, that was easy, with the exception of the first secretary, Solovyov,
                    who was a candidate member of the Politburo, very high ranking. I only sat down
                    with him when Matlock, our ambassador in Moscow, came up and called on him. But
                    other than that it was not difficult at all. We saw the whole range of
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you continuing your practice of going out and going
                        to these lectures?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. Sometimes I went three times a day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have been interviewing Gary Matthews who said he picked
                        up the idea from you. Did you see a change in the environment of these
                        lectures?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. Some of them were completely public, some were not. I went into the
                    Army Club, for example, on a number of them and finally I was asked not to come.
                    They were quite frank, and as time went on became much more frank. For example,
                    I went to this army lecture in the officers' club and the lecture was on
                    discipline, the whole atmosphere in the army. What was said would never have
                    been said unless it was really tightly controlled. They were complaining about
                    their terrible rasing system, the way the non-coms treat...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really did not help the discipline of the Soviet army
                        to continue that....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: They were talking about religious activities in the army which they
                    didn't like. There was a frankness there. At one lecture, really an open
                    lecture, you bought tickets to it, the lecturer was complaining that attendance
                    in church in Lenin Oblast, which is the city and the area around it, out numbers
                    all sporting events, all plays and theater events over the course of a year. The
                    most eye opening lecture was by the economics editor of Literaturnaya Gazetta
                    from Moscow, who came up from Leningrad and spoke at the Writers Club. It was
                    the most incredible indictment of the Soviet system that I ever heard from a
                    Soviet in a Soviet setting. It went from A-Z about everything they had done was
                    wrong. Marxism is a hoax. Marxism economics is a hoax. Stalin was a criminal.
                    The reason our army stood strong at Stalingrad was because Soviet soldiers would
                    be shot in the back if they tried to retreat. Just A-Z. I wrote a long cable on
                    this and got a commendation on it. People were just amazed in the Agency. But,
                    this told you where they were going. This was December, 1986 as I recall. He
                    talked about Sakharov. He talked about a riot that had just taken place in
                    Kazakhstan in which two Russians were killed. And stuff that was not yet getting
                    into the press, but within another period of time it would. So, there was a
                    distinct change in the way they approached problems.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to talk to the intellectual?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they talking about a new age or was their
                        disquiet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: There was both. I think it was very unsettling for Russians. I have been
                    amazed that the changes happened in the Soviet Union without more turmoil than
                    we have seen. There has been almost no turmoil, except in the Caucasus, and that
                    sort of thing. But, when you realize that not only economically was everything
                    pulled out from under them, but also intellectually. Jettisoning the whole
                    ideology was beginning in 1986 and had gone pretty far by 1988. So, yes, people
                    would talk about it. Some people would be disturbed. Most people were happy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to see much happening in the universities,
                        where often ideas bubble up from the students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, you know Soviet students traditionally have not been in the
                    forefront of the dissident movement or new ideas the way they are in most other
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I don't know. Maybe it is a stage in their lives they have not been able
                    to break out of. Unlike American students who break out very early, they were
                    unable to break out of the strict discipline that they had. They always seemed
                    to be very interested in getting ahead, like we portray now our students in the
                    '50s. That may have changed, I don't know, but I never found in my early years
                    in Moscow and then in Leningrad, that the students were in any way in the fore
                    front. Students with special interests might be Jewish students for example, or
                    those people who were very interested in architecture, who had their own
                    interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the Jewish intellectual
                        group? How were they pointed? Were they pointed just to get the hell out and
                        go to the States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: There were two major concerns. The first one was that the Soviets had
                    sort of clamped down on the Jewish people getting out. Brezhnev let an awful lot
                    go out in the '70s, but that came pretty much to an end with the Afghan war. So,
                    when I went there the major issue was Refuseniks. Secondly, as time went on, and
                    I mentioned to you the sort of freeing up of the atmosphere did lead to a rise
                    of sort of home ground anti-Semitism, a movement called Pamyat, and there was a
                    growing fear on the part of Jews in Leningrad that anti-Semitism was bubbling
                    up. The economy at that time was in terrible shape and they felt, as in the past
                    in other countries, they would be the scape goat. I know when I was there we had
                    not only Pamyat meetings, but a number of incidents in Jewish cemeteries where
                    stones were overturned. So, we were all concerned that this might develop into
                    something serious. It really hasn't. This is an amazing thing, a very
                    encouraging thing. But, despite all the economic turmoil throughout the Soviet
                    Union, we have seen only a flourishing now of Jewish life. You pick up the “New
                    York Times” and synagogues are opening, Yiddish is being taught. If that had
                    developed the other way it would have presented us with a major human rights
                    problems and would have been bad for the Jewish community in Leningrad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a particular brief in Leningrad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, yes. That was part and parcel of US policy since the '60s that we
                    would follow this issue and so we did. The main thing was Refuseniks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what a Refusenik was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: A Refusenik, an English word with nik tacked on, is someone who has been
                    refused visas to leave. In my time a number of them left. One must bare in mind
                    that Leningrad traditionally was a hard place, very backward in political terms
                    place. A good example was this lecture I mentioned which was a complete eye
                    opener. That guy had to come from Moscow. In fact, I wrote something shortly
                    thereafter because it was another example of what we noticed that whenever
                    Gorbachev wanted to push the reform line in Leningrad he had to send somebody up
                    from Moscow to do it because the Leningrad party line organization was very
                    conservative. Over the years our consulate had more trouble in Leningrad with
                    officers being PNGed or officers being roughed up, than Moscow had. When I got
                    there the atmosphere was quite good and I can't remember any incidents like that
                    at all. But, just before I got there somebody got roughed up. Oh, somebody was
                    PNGed while I was there. A guy who was aggressively Jewish, he has since left
                    the Foreign Service and is very active in Jewish affairs in the States, was
                    PNGed. He had great contacts and great Russian. But, that was an exception.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about on just the normal consular things? This was a
                        time when more Americans were coming in. Did you have troubles with American
                        tourists?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Lots of problems. We had a small consular section, really just one
                    officer who did consular work. There were a lot of tourists and many the kind
                    that just got into difficulties. I don't mean sailors and people like that, but
                    elderly people. A number of them got sick and one or two died. The other type
                    were student groups. Their problem was usually drinking. We had one 16 year old
                    kid who literally drank himself to death by drinking a bottle of vodka and he
                    died. He was the only child of a divorced woman. A real tragedy. The other one
                    was a 18 year old girl who committed suicide by slitting her wrists and then
                    jumping out of a fifth floor window. We had a consular officer who handled that
                    very well.</p>
                <p>My view on consular work is that we really should bend over backwards because
                    this is where the rubber hits the road, probably the only contact an American
                    citizen has with an American embassy and State Department. We had some good
                    people who did a good job. For example, on one woman who was in the hospital,
                    Larry, who was a political officer who spoke good Russian and the duty officer,
                    went to the hospital to see her. This woman sent us back an article that
                    appeared in the St. Petersburg, Florida newspaper praising the State Department
                    and how solicitous the people were. This is the sort of thing that really
                    counts. Tourism was big business. Boat loads of people would come in from
                    Scandinavia. Big tours. I would talk to groups once a week.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Gary Matthews was telling me that one of the problems
                        about Leningrad was that after there would be big meetings in Moscow of
                        American delegations they would send them off to Leningrad to see the
                        Hermitage and all which meant on weekends he would end up escorting them
                        around. Did you get into that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Congressional delegations required that but not too many came through.
                    However, the tourist groups didn't require that at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about dealing with the Baltic republics during this
                        time? Any changes?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, something had changed and I must say that I wasn't quick enough to
                    see it. We got a note from the Estonian foreign ministry that from now on they
                    would like to have their visas issued by the consulate in Leningrad by simply
                    sending a note from the Estonian foreign ministry to us asking to have a visa
                    put into a Soviet passport. Previously the visa request had come from Moscow on
                    a Soviet ministry of foreign affairs note. I said that I didn't like this idea
                    because I think they were just trying to have us recognize somehow the Estonian
                    foreign ministry when our position has always been that we don't recognize
                    forcible cooperation. Moreover, we were never suppose to deal with anything
                    other than the cities. We were only accredited to the cities, not to the
                    republic. In retrospect, what was probably on the way was actually an attempt on
                    the Estonian ministry to exercise some independence from Moscow, but you could
                    see it both ways. I took it the conservative, negative way. A positive way would
                    have been to bring those guys in. Of course as things developed with the Baltic
                    states during 1989-90 with students fighting and Soviet troops marching into
                    Lithuania, this could have been a feeler along those lines. My reaction was not
                    to have anything to do with it and we didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left Leningrad in August 1988. Why don't we pick
                        it up the next time after that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is September 25, 1996. Ed, so you left in August,
                        1988 to go where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I came back to the Department to INR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I was director of the office of research and analysis for Soviet Union
                    and Eastern Europe. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union that office is divided
                    up. Basically we covered the entire European bloc so to speak including the
                    Baltic states. On the EUR side, the Baltic states were in EE rather than
                    SOV.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in INR from 1988-91. If anybody was going to be
                        in research and analysis I can't think of a more exciting time except maybe
                        in 1917 or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, that is very true. In retrospect it was an incredible time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time you arrived at your assignment what was the
                        prognosis whither the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, you know perestroika, glasnost, the whole Gorbachev dismantling of
                    the Party as they knew it at the time was in full swing. Rather early on, at
                    least in my tenure in INR, there was a feeling that this would definitely lead
                    to some very big changes, although nothing close to what actually happened. For
                    example, I don't remember the exact date, although it couldn't be later than
                    early 1990, there was a conference under the auspicious of the CIA held on the
                    so-called farm down in Virginia which was attended by intelligence reps from US,
                    UK, Canada, Australia and possibly New Zealand. The upshot of that was one
                    conclusion that in five years we would see a Soviet Union that was quite
                    different from what we were seeing then and speculation along those lines
                    centered on somehow the break away from the Union of such states as the Baltic
                    states and Georgia was thrown in at that time because there had been
                    demonstrations involving loss of live by that time. So there was an awareness
                    quite early and although we didn't see the collapse of the Soviet Union, we saw
                    bits of it breaking off. That was a fairly wide spread consensus. I don't think
                    anybody demurred from that, including our allies.</p>
                <p>We also saw vast changes were underway in Eastern Europe. There again while I
                    don't think we foresaw in 1988-89 that it would move as fast as it did it
                    certainly took no special skills or foresight to detect a trend there. Where it
                    would end was the only question. A lot of these trends, at least in Eastern
                    Europe, had been underway for quite a while. The crack down of the Czechs in the
                    spring of 1968. The Hungarians gradually pulling away. So, I think our analysis
                    was good as far as it went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that there were skeptics who were saying this
                        was all very good but the Soviet Union is going to be the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. I thought you were going to talk about people who might be saying,
                    as indeed some did, that this is really not very important at all for the Soviet
                    Union. That what was taking place was a kind of arranging the deck chairs on the
                    Titanic, not that people saw it going down but something being relatively minor
                    reform at the fringes and we still had a very powerful, very aggressive Soviet
                    Union, nothing had changed. This was the position of a lot of people slightly to
                    the right. It was a fairly common theme you found in the press.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>I think those of us who were closer to what was going on really saw what
                    Gorbachev was up to. I think we really thought there was more to it than that.
                    Gorbachev wasn't interested in having the Soviet Union fall a part but he was
                    basically intent on changing the purpose, the functions, the power of the Party.
                    He understood that the Party in its primary role it had in every field, whether
                    science, culture, politics, military, and the way dissent of any kind had been
                    suppressed also meant that there couldn't be any creativity, any bubbling up
                    from below. There couldn't be any necessary seeking out of real solutions and
                    the Soviets had real problems at the time. He was really aware of that and
                    wanted to unseat the Party from its position of primacy, which was a very basic
                    feature of the Soviet Union. We saw that. I think we called that and put this in
                    stuff that went forward. I believe that the people in military, DIA, I don't
                    think CIA had an ax to grind, but certainly DIA did and a lot of the
                    administration. There were conflicting views, I think in the case of DIA, based
                    on turf and based on the realization that a lot of what they were doing depended
                    on the existence of a Soviet threat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the 1989 events in Berlin, Czechoslovakia and Poland,
                        you must have been called upon to look hard at the intentions of the Soviet
                        Union on this. What were you seeing as the whole Eastern Bloc came a part?
                        It was 1989 wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. The first step in the fall of the wall was the Hungarians clipping
                    their barbed wire fence between Hungary and Austria, which really was the first
                    breach in the physical iron curtain. And, of course, East German tourists that
                    had been in Hungary just funneled across the border into Austria.</p>
                <p>I think rather early Gorbachev made a decision that Soviet troops would not be
                    used to help stem this tide of refugees flowing into Austria and Germany and the
                    tide of liberalization that was sweeping Czechoslovakia and Poland. In Poland it
                    was quite clear that they did not move. They didn't move in 1981 when martial
                    law was declared. Gorbachev had made it clear and I don't know if we had any
                    prior knowledge of this, but later it appeared in the press that he told
                    Honecker that the Soviets would not intervene to help the East Germans either.
                    So, there had been a major shift from the old Brezhnev doctrine of 1968.
                    Gorbachev said to the East Europeans that they were on their own. The Soviets
                    were not going to help defend them. And, of course, that was crucial. What kept
                    Eastern Europe, Eastern Europe, was the commitment of the Soviet Union to keep
                    it communist. Once that commitment was lifted, Eastern Europe was bound to
                    go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find during this time there were extraordinary
                        demands on INR to figure out what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: There were extraordinary demands. We used to sit around the table twice
                    a day in INR with all the offices in the morning with the assistant secretary
                    and in the afternoon we would prepare or inform the front office what items we
                    suggested be in our daily intelligence summary. There were also summaries
                    produced by others in intelligence communities. Unfailingly our office was
                    producing twice as much of these things. It was the top issue of the day. I
                    should say one thing though, this was in the era when there was really growing,
                    frank conversations, meetings, messages, between the Secretary and
                    Shevardnadze.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shevardnadze being the Soviet foreign minister and James
                        Baker being our secretary of state.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: There was really an extraordinary degree of exchange and frank
                    discussions. I think the administration handled the whole situation rather well.
                    I think from the beginning they did handle it in a very balanced way and fended
                    off people who were totally dismissing the changes taking place as cosmetic
                    touch up of communism. I think Baker and Bush really understood that big things
                    were underway and they tried to encourage it, but not in a gloating way and not
                    in a provocative way. I think it was handled just right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In many ways we were probably fortunate because the Reagan
                        administration, although it had been making changes, still had its number of
                        ideologues and all that where as the Bush administration really was a much
                        more internationalist, not as ideologically committed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: That's true, but I dare say, I can't imagine Kissinger taking a very
                    different approach. After all Kissinger went through his period of detente with
                    Brezhnev when there was less reason for expecting the Soviets to be interested
                    in real dialogue and real change. And, Brzezinski as well, although Brzezinski
                    has this pretty harsh outlook toward the communists.</p>
                <p>You asked about the demands. There were great demands, particularly when you had
                    these meetings. One of INR's main job was to prepare what was called the red
                    team paper. In other words, we prepared a paper for all of these meetings at all
                    levels from deputy secretary up to the president. As I say meetings were taking
                    place rather frequently at the UN, there were summits, international meetings.
                    The red team paper was suppose to set out what the Soviets might say. This was
                    what they were thinking and the talking points that they might raise. So, there
                    was a lot of work.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There must have been quite a sense of exhilaration. The
                        Foreign Service officer thrives when things are bustling around and
                        happening. Did you find this at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. We were lucky to have at INR a good mix at the time of Foreign
                    Service officers and really expert civil servants on both sides. It is true that
                    with some exceptions civil servants tend to be a little bit slower in their
                    approach to things and more deliberate, not as keyed to the rapid response.</p>
                <p>I don't know if you want to go into it here, but INR has always had a problem
                    that if you have Foreign Service officers in there, which I think is a good
                    idea, you take for granted their energy, their zeal, their quickness, their
                    awareness of what policy might want, but on the other hand you question
                    sometimes whether they have the substance expertise. I found out in my own case
                    I lacked quite a bit when it came to Eastern Europe and that incredibly arcane
                    subject of Yugoslavia. I can say something on that if you like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, please do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I recall that I was very bearish on Yugoslavia's collapse. I tried to
                    down play to some extent, not to see a really momentous outcome from the
                    problems that the Yugoslavs were having either with at the very early stages in
                    1988-89 between the Serbs and the Kosovars and later between the Serbs and the
                    Croats which developed into warfare, to say nothing of what was coming down the
                    pike from Bosnia. I tended to see it all as more or less what was happening in
                    the Soviet Union, the tendency to loosen the communist ties that bound. But, the
                    Yugoslav types, one was a Foreign Service officer and one was not, were taking a
                    much more drastic approach. I remember one of them saying what was going on now
                    between the Serbs and the Croats in 1990-91 was serious, but if this should
                    spread to Bosnia then we will really see a blood bath and a momentous flow of
                    refugees. This was all said in a paper. I remember distinctly saying, “Look, I
                    am going to let this go forward, but I don't buy it really. I think you are just
                    being alarmist. Yes, it is a worse case scenario and get it in there somewhere
                    as a worse case scenario, but don't predict it.” Well, he predicted it and he
                    was right. So, it is very hard for one person to be an expert in everything.
                    But, INR does need this mix of real experts and more activist types. I think
                    they are working on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I worked in INR on the Horn of Africa at one time and I
                        had the Foreign Service approach which is a little quick and dirty, I would
                        say, and maybe a little simplistic, but, often responsive for what the job
                        calls for. However, there isn't the depth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>What was the role of INR? You say you produced these red team papers stating what
                    the Soviets were thinking for all these conferences, etc. But, what was your
                    interaction say with the desks, etc.? How did INR fit into that?</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, you know, that is another problem with INR. Very often you would
                    have the feeling that the point of contact is not laterally at the lower level
                    but at a higher level, what you feed your assistant secretary either orally or
                    written. Or what you feed as an INR analyst in the form of a memo directly to
                    our assistant secretary who forwarded them to the EUR assistant secretary. But
                    in a lot of cases, unless you had personal working relationship with the desk
                    officer, you really didn't deal with the desk officer very much. Having been a
                    desk officer, I know why this is the case, and having seen desk officers at work
                    on Yugoslavia. The desk officer is pretty much an action officer. On the Soviet
                    desk they are over loaded with questions about day to day operation of the
                    embassy, personnel matters, visitors, CODELs and that sort of thing and very
                    often they don't have time or don't want to make time for INR. A lot of the desk
                    officers, except when an issue comes up as something they have to make a
                    decision or a proposal on, are not really interested, or at least they don't
                    evince much interest in the longer view of policy or course of action. I think
                    that is probably true. I don't know to what extent the Mexico desk officer sits
                    down and thinks “Whither Mexico?” as much as he thinks, “Oh, my god, the DEA
                    Administrator is going to Mexico next week and I have to prepare.” I can't say
                    that INR is as aware of a culture in the Department as I am about INR being a
                    backwater, not too good for your career. What does INR say? “It is a culture
                    that doesn't seem to be replicated at the higher level, particularly if somebody
                    has come in from the outside like secretaries and deputy secretaries. They are
                    more interested in longer term analysis.”</p>
                <p>So, we did not deal with...now the analysts might have more so than I did with
                    their real counterparts on the desk. But, that is about as far as it went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the assistant secretary for INR at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: First it was Morton Abramowitz, who was an extremely good and bright
                    guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine what was happening in the Soviet Union was the
                        major focus at that time? Was Abramowitz very much involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. Morton wasn't there that long. He left four or five months after I
                    arrived. He was very good on a worldwide basis. He had a deputy assistant
                    secretary who technically oversaw our office as well as some other geographical
                    offices. He wasn't too good, didn't have much of a background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who took Abramowitz's place?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: A guy called Doug Mulholland, who was a CIA officer at one time and then
                    had gone into retirement and was called back. Mulholland had no particular
                    expertise in my area. He was a very fine gentleman, very low keyed guy. He
                    didn't get involve in the nitty gritty leaving that to his deputy assistant
                    secretaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So often it is not whether the person in charge knows the
                        subject, but whether they are well connected above that is important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, Morton Abramowitz certainly was. And Mort was good because he
                    asked good questions, he had good insight and instincts. I can't say that about
                    his successor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things about the Bush administration in foreign
                        affairs was, it was said, that James Baker had a small coterie around him,
                        many of whom had come from the Treasury and it was a rather closed circle
                        and many decisions were made within that group. Did you have the feeling
                        that there was good entre for your product?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, there was. There again I talked about things going straight to the
                    top and not going straight down. I think Baker paid a lot of attention to our
                    stuff. There was also the policy planning staff, those people came down and saw
                    quite a bit of us and asked us to do things. I am quite aware of this closed
                    circle angle with Baker, but it wasn't anything that shut out INR. I think INR's
                    access and their regard for INR was as high as any I had seen in the Department,
                    and I had been in INR before. If anything, INR got its foot in the door, at
                    least in written stuff, as much as anybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't think of any time in our history, other than
                        during war, where there would be as much of a challenge on intelligence
                        organizations to try to keep up with what is happening as those few years
                        you were in INR. What was your impression of the input of the CIA at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: I can't say that I saw everything. There were things at all levels of
                    classification. I would get to see things on occasion when I would be called to
                    the INR front office and shown a piece of paper. In terms of analysis, I think
                    the CIA was pretty accurate. They got bad press for making the Soviet Union seem
                    ten times taller than it actually was, but I think that oversight, if it was an
                    oversight, was justified. If you are a scholar you can go out there and say in
                    ten years the Soviet Union is going to be no more and you walk away. If it goes
                    wrong, so what, you were wrong. But, if you are an intelligence agency that is
                    giving advice to government that is in place now and has to react now, you don't
                    say this and that to everything because the Cold War is over. I think very
                    rarely there were disputes on how things seemed to be working out between them
                    and us. I think they did a fairly decent job. I cited that meeting we had down
                    there in Virginia. There basically was quite a bit of consensus. Now, that does
                    not include DIA which constantly took the line that nothing much was happening,
                    the Soviet Union was as big and aggressive as ever and would continue to be that
                    way. But, we didn't pay much attention to DIA stuff. I think the CIA got a bad
                    rap on not having predicted the down falling and making the Soviet Union appear
                    much stronger than it actually was. Until the time that it actually fell a part,
                    everything was basically in place that you could see...they had the weapons, the
                    tanks, the deployments, the armaments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing a change at all in the Soviet economy? I
                        am wondering if it was almost a problem that anybody who served in the
                        Soviet Union as long as you have, would begin to say, “Well, this is kind of
                        the way it is.” and not see that there are some things where the Soviets
                        were really beginning to slip?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: That was all obvious. I thought you were going to say those of us who
                    served in the Soviet Union [used their] economic prowess and their ability to
                    carry on. That was often a problem, but it turned out more skepticism rather
                    than less was the right way to approach it. But, invariably you would get
                    somebody to go to Moscow and he would come back and here people were saying that
                    the Soviets are strong and the second greatest power in the world. You even had
                    some experts like Galbraith back in the '70s, predicting that the Soviets might
                    even be the wave of the future. He would come back from Moscow and say, “Wait a
                    minute, go fifty kilometers outside of Moscow and you are 150 years in the
                    past.” So, being close to the Soviet Union would have made you predict disaster
                    sooner then other people. Certainly by my tenure in INR the problems the Soviets
                    were facing were very clear, although you can't be a futurist in dealing with
                    short middle term issues like readiness, like prospects for leadership changes,
                    so you have to take a relatively cautious approach. But, the real, basic
                    problems in the Soviet economy were very clear by 1988. There were falling oil
                    prices, oil being about the only thing they exported. Transportation breakdowns.
                    Shortages all over. Crumbling infrastructure. Lack of information and contact
                    with the outside world, which is the key to progress now and one reason they
                    fell. All those things were pretty clear. There again, I can't say the CIA, or
                    the Department for that matter, was remiss in not saying “hey, wait a minute.
                    Hang on for a couple more years and they won't be so....”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were on the red team, how would you figure out
                        what the Soviets were thinking? What was the thought process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, let's say you assume the question of the Middle East is going to
                    come up, either because both sides have agreed beforehand that is going to be on
                    the agenda or because it just looks like a good possibility. You had at the time
                    a guy who specialized in Soviet policy towards the Middle East and a few other
                    areas. So we sit down and discuss what they have been saying recently, what they
                    really want, what things on the ground look like, that is to say economic steps,
                    troop movements, visits they have had. Let's go back over the last time we
                    discussed this with them and see what changes their might be or what they are
                    likely to bring up, what's on their mind. Then we include that Middle East
                    question in the paper we would send forward. It typically took the form of a
                    talking points paper, but not suggesting replies. That was something that INR
                    didn't do. We just explained what the Soviets might say and the desk at the same
                    time was preparing a paper, including the same stuff but without the depth or
                    explanation.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. They, too, were very self absorbed. The internal stuff was taking a
                    lot of their time and effort. I think perhaps one of the most fundamental moves
                    that Gorbachev made in the very early days when he came in in March, 1985, was
                    pulling out of Afghanistan, which was a key move in a key area for them. And, I
                    think it signaled that times were changing.</p>

                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, Premakov's big role in that at the time we were rolling back
                    Saddam's forces out of Kuwait and it looked like the Iraqis were about to give
                    up. Premakov went off to Baghdad and tried to get involved bringing the Soviets
                    into the final settlement. That was considered a nasty thing to do. I know the
                    press really took off against the Soviets for that and we were very annoyed by
                    it. But, basically, the Soviets surprisingly kept their hands off. I don''t know
                    how that was signaled to us that they wouldn't get involved at all. Of course,
                    Iraq had been a very substantial ally in the area. The Soviets always propped up
                    Saddam with military equipment and support against Israel. The fact that they
                    let this go on without much squawking really indicated the extent to which they
                    were opting out of real active diplomacy.</p>

                <p>HURWITZ: No, not really. The Wall fell in November, 1989 and I think the
                    unification came about officially October, 1990. There was a lot of talk about
                    how Eastern Europeans would be very nervous with a united Germany. How France
                    might be nervous. How a divided Germany over the years had seemed to work to
                    everybody's advantage. Even that the Germans, themselves, were a bit concerned
                    about how they , as a country now would react finally being united for the first
                    time since Hitler was in power. So, there was this nervousness on everybody's
                    part. But, it certainly did not enter into US policy. I can't recall being asked
                    at any time to do a paper analyzing what a united Germany might mean in the
                    sense of an alarm bell going off. I did do things on Eastern Europe's approach
                    and concerns about a united Germany, but nothing that I can recall would impinge
                    on or in any way effect our really firm insistence that Germany be united and be
                    part of NATO.</p>
                <p>Allowing Germany to enter NATO as a united country was a big sticking point for
                    the Soviets for a long time and one that Gorbachev stuck his neck out over. Now,
                    the issue of whether the Soviets would stand for this was on our plate. Whether
                    this would upset the Soviet union. That is to say, Gorbachev let their former
                    ally, their most advanced partner in the Warsaw Pact, switch camps and join
                    NATO. That was a big issue and we were discussing that pretty actively. Would
                    this not be some kind of straw that would break Gorbachev's back. I think it
                    added to Gorbachev's problems but we were not going to back track. I credit Bush
                    pushing very hard for that, and Baker too. I am sure they spoke to Gorbachev
                    about it. They supported him by saying this was going to be a good step and it
                    shouldn't cause Gorbachev to collapse and neither were we going to crow that
                    this is a great anti-Soviet step, a defeat to the Soviets. So that worked out
                    rather well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The problem of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Did they
                        start to break away while you were in INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Everything really collapsed just before the Gorbachev coup. They had
                    this meeting outside of Moscow at one of the official dachas where all the
                    representatives signed on to what was essentially the breakup of the Soviet
                    Union. The Baltic states had left before August, 1991.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned that there was going to be a coup
                        against Gorbachev at that time or that something was going to happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I personally, and INR and the State Department, too, was basically
                    taking the position that we do not want to be seen as either gloating over what
                    was happening or pushing Gorbachev out or pushing for the break up of the Soviet
                    union at that point. You may recall that instance where Bush went to Kiev and
                    said something to the effect that you don't want to break things up too fast. He
                    was roundly criticized by the press and roundly criticized by the same people
                    today for relying too much on Gorbachev as a leader and somebody who could
                    oversee this breakup in an orderly fashion, which would not destabilize the
                    situation. By the same token today, the government has been taking flak for
                    relying too much on Yeltsin, who at that time was the darling of the more
                    conservative American analysts and politicos. But that has switched. Indeed this
                    is something that I know we had to contend with throughout at that time, that is
                    Bush and Baker being too much in bed with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze. As I say,
                    I think they handled it extremely well and did exactly what had to be done. It
                    didn't help Gorbachev and it wasn't necessarily meant to help Gorbachev
                    individually, but I think he was, at the top level of our government, correctly
                    seen as a steady hand on the tiller. And, with all those weapons out there, the
                    last thing we wanted was the Soviet Union to collapse in chaos. I don't know
                    that it would have done so even if we had tried to push it over the precipice,
                    but those are risks you don't take at the time.</p>
                <p>It has not worked out badly when you consider the breakup itself was virtually
                    bloodless. You did have these riots that were put down in Tbilisi in 1989 and in
                    Lithuania in 1990 by Soviet violence, but the actual breakup occurred without
                    bloodshed and indeed in the August coup you had only three people killed nation
                    wide, which is an amazing thing. So, to that extent it worked out. We have now
                    been able to, despite the well known efforts to prop Gorbachev up a bit, get
                    along very well with Yeltsin and with the other republics. You have no chaos
                    except for Chechnya, which is a special case. So, I think it was handled well by
                    both administrations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time were we focusing on the
                        nationalities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, very much so. Of course, the nationalities issue had always been a
                    kind of subset issue of the Soviet Union. We had for many, many years, before I
                    got there, a guy in INR who followed Soviet nationalities. The object then was
                    to sort of ferret out indications of dissatisfaction with the Soviet regime.
                    That dissatisfaction took the form of cultural dissidents, the Jewish Refuseniks
                    and national groups that felt their culture and whole nationality was being down
                    trodden by the Soviets. So that was something we always followed and as time
                    went on we followed it more closely. The issue now is almost dead except for the
                    nationality entities that still exist in the Russian Federation, like the
                    Chechnyans or Tartars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was the attempted coup against Gorbachev?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: August, 1991. That was during my watch in INR. It was successful for a
                    couple of days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that news hit you all and what was within INR the
                        response to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I was on vacation and was on Prince Edward Island. I got up one morning
                    and was listening on a small transistor to VOA news and heard about the coup. I
                    watched a bit on television and then through some fancy footwork got myself on a
                    plane back to the Department. They were going full blast trying to find out what
                    was going on and trying to monitor the success or lack of success of this
                    coup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the opinion about the people who were pulling the
                        coup?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, well, it was quite clear that these were really comedians in a
                    sense. They were people we had been following all along and were obviously
                    identified as right wing elements. I should say leading up to the coup, one of
                    the things we were really watching closely and which feed this mini dispute over
                    whither Gorbachev, was the extent to which Gorbachev veered from left to right.
                    For a considerable period up to the coup, he had veered right and had put in
                    positions people who were very right wing like Yanayev, like minister of defense
                    Yazov, and the new head of the KGB, who later killed himself. We were watching
                    all these right wingers being appointed to positions and really were somewhat
                    concerned about what this did mean. I think Gorbachev in April 1989 had
                    decimated the right wing leadership of the various oblasts. It was really a
                    clever step getting rid of all these ensconced hard line communists from their
                    local __________. He seemed to be on a very liberalization kick, but then he
                    played both sides back and forth. We were in one of these back swings when the
                    coup happened. Now, he may have brought these people up with the understanding
                    that they were so bumbling and a lot less than clever, that he could handle
                    them. It was better to have them around where he could keep an eye on them then
                    to have them off plotting somewhere else. Well, it turned out they plotted when
                    he was on vacation. It also turns out that they did a lousy job. I think one
                    nice thing about the coup is it showed the support for liberalization had gone
                    very far down at least in the apparatus of the government. You had the military
                    basically siding with Gorbachev in the sense they took no action. So, as I say,
                    the coup could have been a lot worse than it was. Only three people were
                    killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a progression in our estimation and evaluation
                        of Yeltsin during the time you were there? I'm thinking of times when there
                        was a real attempt to denigrate Yeltsin and call him a drunken buffoon and
                        this type of thing, particularly from the White House.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I think early on Yeltsin began to display this bizarre behavior
                    intermittently and that really concerned people. There were all these reports of
                    his drinking when he came here. At one point up at Johns Hopkins he was really
                    out of it, liquor-wise. Reports we got of visits he had made to France having
                    the same things. His strange disappearances, his strange actions. All of these
                    things added up. But, he always managed when the chips were down to come forward
                    and sound very rational and be rational and to get along with Bush and Clinton.
                    But, I think the bleat that you hear from the same people who were saying we
                    were too much involved with Gorbachev and are now saying it about Yeltsin is
                    sort of a built in response. They simply just want us to be more circumspect and
                    suspicious when it comes to dealing with Soviets period. But, I think throughout
                    one thing we were always looking for was evidence that Yeltsin was okay or not
                    okay physically and mentally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time were we watching Yeltsin closely?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. Certainly starting from the coup. He had won the presidential
                    election of the RSFR in 1990. He was being watched throughout.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Soviet Union break up while you were in INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of demands were laid on you and what sort of
                        output was coming out of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: This was pretty much when I was getting ready to leave INR. Our big
                    concern was the viability of the control system, the Soviet military. What were
                    the prospects of this kind of instability or riots, things like that. How would
                    the system work? What would happen to the economy? How would they divvy all of
                    this up? Those were the issues we were watching.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the state of the Soviet military left up to the

                        the morale, what role will the military forces play?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I don't remember any specific demands on us for papers on military
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left there in 1991 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Then I went to the Board of Examiners.</p>

                <p>HURWITZ: September, 1991 until February, 1992 when I was nominated as ambassador.
                    I basically eased out of the Board of Examiners and began this whole process of
                    the papers you have to submit. I actually went to Kyrgyzstan at the end of
                    March, 1992 as charg�, sort of an unusual situation. The embassy had opened in
                    February and they had a temporary charg�, Ed McWilliams, who had served in
                    Afghanistan after me at one point. He opened the embassy with an advanced team
                    in February, 1992, and I took his place in March, 1992. I stayed there until
                    July, came home and went through the ambassadorial seminar, etc. and was
                    confirmed on August 6, 1992 and went back in September as ambassador.</p>

                <p>HURWITZ: September, 1992 to October, 1994.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe Kyrgyzstan the first time you went out
                        there? How it was put together and what you were trying to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Kyrgyzstan governmentwise, like all these countries, was in a state of
                    transition, as was our policy. We had considerable hopes for Kyrgyzstan because
                    it was one of, perhaps the only, newly created ex-Soviet state that did not have
                    the old ex-Party official as the number one guy. The president was Askar Akayev,
                    a scientist, a physicist, who before assuming the presidency was president of
                    the Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences. We had some hopes that this would be a real new
                    leaf and that you could have an actual democratic country arising from the ashes
                    of the Soviet Union. It was clear from the beginning that they would have
                    immense economic problems. That was one thing we could not deal with
                    immediately. What we were hoping to get and what really evolved anyway was a
                    situation in which you didn't have a lot of turmoil. A situation in which even
                    at the time we were concerned about was the Iranians moving in. We weren't
                    concerned about Turkish influence, but we were curious to how the Turks would
                    react to this. A big issue was how would the Russians react. Now that this thing
                    officially exists will the Russians try to work out a situation in which the
                    independence is more of a question of what is on paper? Then you had the issue
                    of China. There is a 400 kilometer border with China, which is something else
                    that concerned us. But the main issue was to try to get the Kyrgyz government,
                    society, moving on a basically democratic, stable track.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here we are the American charg� and then ambassador way
                        off in Central Asia with an embryo government. What was your role, how did
                        you operate there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: You do the basic things. You present your credentials. You get to know
                    as many people as you can. You go around to the ministries. You talk to people.
                    You hold their hands in a certain manner of speaking. It was an incredible
                    situation where you had all these people who only understood the trappings. They
                    had a foreign ministry but the Kyrgyz foreign ministry had done absolutely
                    nothing except to arrange visits of Cuban Trade Unionists and stuff like that.
                    Kyrgyzstan had always been a distant outpost of the Soviet Union. It was perhaps
                    the most obedient of all Soviet republics. And, it was one that had prospered
                    because of the Soviet Union. I recall in all my tours in the Soviet Union the
                    question used to be asked by Russians, at first in a non-public way because you
                    couldn't raise questions like this, was “Do we get more out of Central Asia or
                    do we give it more?” Well, by the time I went to Leningrad and glasnost was in
                    full bloom, you would hear this question raised at public meetings. Why are we
                    spending money to give to these little black people to support them? Well, you
                    could argue the issue both ways, I suppose, when it came to Kazakhstan or
                    Uzbekistan with oil, gold and cotton, but in the case of Kyrgyzstan there was no
                    question but that everything you saw, every institute, every library, every
                    theater, every factory was there at the largess of the Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>And they did incredible things to prop up this distant republic to make it look
                    prosperous and give jobs to everybody. For example, they built in Kyrgyzstan one
                    of the largest sugar refineries in the Soviet Union. A refinery that could only
                    refine sugar cane, which came from Cuba. So, it was shipped from Cuba all the
                    way across the Soviet Union. The refinery, by the way, was not equipped to
                    refine sugar beets which can be grown around Kyrgyzstan. But it was done for
                    jobs, you had to give them something to do.</p>
                <p>The Soviets liked it in one respect and found it very convenient because it was
                    like Colorado with so many sunny days, it was a great place for flying
                    instructions. It was a place where budding pilots being trained could train
                    around 300 days a year. So, they had an air school there which trained not only
                    a lot of Soviets but Afghans, Cubans, Ethiopians, etc. You occasionally would
                    see little black kids running around, the offspring of an Ethiopian or
                    Congolese, Patrice Lumumba style, air man and a Russian lady. They also used the
                    Issyk Kul. Did you ever go to the lake?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: It is an enormous lake high up in the mountains. They used that to test
                    torpedoes in submarines because this was a body of water totally landlocked,
                    totally within Kyrgyzstan, a body of water into which they could be certain
                    American submarines couldn't come and monitor the tests. So, they tested the
                    missiles and also had a torpedo factory. And, of course, it was a crucial place
                    because of the Chinese. Once you are in the Far East you had to protect it.</p>
                <p>But other then that it had very little in the way of industry. It had some animal
                    husbandry, but very primitive by world standards. It had gold, but in areas very
                    difficult to extract it from. And that is about it. So, when the Soviet
                    umbilical cord was cut, Kyrgyzstan was and still is in big trouble. How do you
                    deal with this? They didn't have a clue.</p>

                        your tour in Kyrgyzstan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I arrived in the capacity of charg�, although I had been announced as
                    the future ambassador but had not been confirmed or appeared before the Senate
                    Foreign Relations Committee. I had been preceded by Ed McWilliams, also in that
                    capacity. He had literally opened the embassy, finding a temporary location for
                    it while living in a hotel room. I understand the embassy is still there. I
                    arrived a month and a half after McWilliams.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>I arrived March, 1992, went home in July and went through the ambassadorial
                    seminar, appeared in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was
                    confirmed on August 6, I believe it was, and returned to Kyrgyzstan in September
                    as ambassador. So, I was ambassador from September, 1992 until October,
                    1994.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk first about the household arrangements. Could
                        you describe the embassy and staff's working conditions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: The working conditions were incredibly bad. We had as a building a
                    structure that from every standpoint was inadequate whether talking about
                    security or the ability to function. It was a small, one story, old structure
                    that had been at one time the Bishkek Komsomol headquarters, and at one time the
                    city tax office, and I would occasionally get telephone calls concerning city
                    taxes and had by my phone the number of the current tax office so I could direct
                    people. Security was zilch. It was a fire trap. In my tenure there we did have
                    an electrical fire. Anybody who wanted to toss a note, a rock or a bomb through
                    the front window could have done so. It was a small structure. We had a very
                    small staff, of course. People came and went, but we had about seven Americans
                    when I was there. There were 10 or 12 locals including drivers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I visited you there and the place was just incredibly
                        crowded. To my mind it looked about the size of what we could call a 1930,
                        two-bedroom, single story house, the kind you hoped you would work out of as
                        a family man in time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Right. That, of course, was the idea. We did expect to move fairly soon.
                    Unfortunately, the team that went in to choose the embassy building in January,
                    1992, were shown a number of buildings which they turned down largely on
                    security grounds. They were justified in doing so, but what they ended up with
                    was far worse. We simply didn't estimate properly the difficulty finding a
                    better building as a follow on. And, we didn't estimate how difficult it would
                    be dealing with the Kyrgyz. I understand the negotiations are still in progress
                    to have a plot of land outside the main center of the city, but quite close, on
                    which we would build our own building. I think you may know that the State
                    Department at that time had just begun that project of bringing in already made
                    embassies. They would just ship them in and put them together. The first
                    successful attempt at doing that was some place in Africa. They already have one
                    in Ashgabat. Now, the transportation difficulties getting to Kyrgyzstan really
                    compounded that problem. But, it was considered the only way to go because all
                    the standing structures, as you saw, in Bishkek, were either solid but very old
                    and totally inadequate and probably full of asbestos and every other hazard you
                    can think of, or they were not adequately defendable, or both. So, FBO figured
                    in the long run to renovate anything you might find would cost as much as
                    bringing in something that we would know from scratch was secure, adequate and
                    clean. And that is the way they are going to go, but I don't know when this will
                    happen.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say clean do you mean free of bugs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Free of structural hazards including rats and asbestos, particularly.
                    The physical circumstances were extremely difficult. The housing was also very
                    difficult. Bishkek was surprisingly well off when it came to housing compared to
                    the Soviet norm. On the other hand, by our standards, the housing was woefully
                    inadequate. I must have seen 15 or 20 buildings as possible residences and I
                    settled on none of them. I lived for four months in a hotel room, me and about
                    ten thousand cockroaches, and then moved into an apartment that I had looked at
                    and said, “Take it” but for use by a staff member. Well, the staff member, who
                    moved in immediately, was my first DCM, who later left because his child
                    developed medical problems there. When he vacated it I moved in. I think the
                    current ambassador is still living in that place, although they have added what
                    was a separate additional apartment, putting the two together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about staff morale during your time there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: It is curious, but I would say staff morale was high. You are working
                    check by jowl here, it is not that you are not aware of problems, although very
                    often the ambassador is less aware of problems that people might have. But, I
                    was working side by side and talked to everybody every day. You had that sort of
                    hyper-activity. Your know, morale was good and you had a lot to do, a lot of
                    challenges, and it is all new and interesting. I think that was the case. In
                    fact, when talking about this to personnel people in the Department, they made
                    the point, and I think it is probably a valid one, they were less worried about
                    the first wave of embassy officers and staff in all these new embassies that
                    were undergoing more or less the same problems—some had it worse than others and
                    we had it as bad as anybody—but they were more concerned about the second wave
                    when things were settled and when everyday didn't present a new, possibly
                    frustrating, but exciting adventure. And, I think for that first wave which I
                    was in and all our staff was in that there was this feeling of excitement. And,
                    the people they sent out, which in some respects was bad, were young, a couple
                    of first tour officers. This hurt in terms of experience, but added something in
                    terms of morale.</p>
                <p>Let me just make one further point that added to the difficulties that we faced.
                    To get people out in a hurry they had to go to a system of TDYs. So, for the
                    first year and a half I had seven admin officers. They were all experienced guys
                    but they came and they left. The question of establishing a real presence,
                    having some institutional memory and some follow through, was a real
                    problem.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went out there did you carry in your mental
                        attach� case a series of things that you wanted to get done, either from
                        consultation with the Department, instructions from the Department and your
                        own? What did you want to accomplish when you went out there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: From the very beginning Kyrgyzstan had a good reputation. I didn't know
                    anything about Kyrgyzstan and I had spent a lot of time in the Soviet Union as
                    the record shows. I hadn't given much thought to Central Asia and hadn't been
                    particularly interested in it, even though I had had a tour in Afghanistan. But,
                    Kyrgyzstan was already getting a good reputation in the Department for its
                    seemingly greater interest in having a real democratic country. It was the only
                    former Soviet republic whose president was not the last first secretary of the
                    Party. He was an academic who was certainly talk up a great democracy line. Our
                    position, the government's position and mine, was to try to see what we could do
                    to foster this, to keep it going on a democratic track and also so find out what
                    they could do to overcome their economic problems, the fact that they had so
                    little to work with. They were indeed running on empty and cut off from the
                    Soviets they would be facing grave economic problems. So, the major task as I
                    saw it was twofold. One, making sure they keep going politically on a democratic
                    track and two, economically trying to see what they could do and to use their
                    reputation for democracy to drum up support for them among the world business
                    community. And, I think we succeeded to a great extent and they succeeded too.
                    We have made them focus on the political atmosphere as a means of pulling
                    themselves up by their boot straps economically, or at least getting help so
                    that they could begin to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. The point I
                    would make constantly and which became rather a touchy thing prior to my
                    departure was “Look, right now you don't have much to work with other than your
                    reputation. Keep it going and we will do our best to get you US aid and to
                    encourage others to help out.” So, that was more or less my function and the US
                    in general. And, we succeeded in terms of US aid. At one time Kyrgyzstan was
                    getting more aid per capita from the US than any other former Soviet
                    republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about our role and what type of aid
                        was coming?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: You may remember there was a lot of money being thrown at the Soviet
                    Union. The question for the embassy was to convince the administration and the
                    administration to convince congress that Kyrgyzstan deserved a really good share
                    of this aid. So, we kept close track of what they were doing right and informed
                    the Department as events progressed. There was another problem of seeing that
                    this aid was properly used. I would have maybe 15 people a week come through who
                    had either already gotten AID grants or were seeking AID grants. Some of the
                    schemes were dreams, simply off base, unrealistic, displayed a lot of ignorance
                    about the situation on the ground in Kyrgyzstan and about what they really need
                    and how they operated. My role was to tell them this wouldn't work or, if it was
                    already on paper and beginning to take effect, to tell the Department this was a
                    mistake.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these usually people from the United States coming
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. They were what I used to call grantologists, people who had studied
                    the whole subject of getting grants, never mind how useful these projects would
                    actually be. For these people it was a living. Some of them were completely off
                    base.</p>
                <p>Let me give you one example of something that had taken off and was operating.
                    This was the farmer-to-farmer program, which to some extent was very useful, but
                    had many aspects that were silly. Basically the idea is that this
                    farmer-to-farmer organization would send out—and it is operated as I say quite
                    usefully in a lot of areas in that part of the world—delegations of American
                    farmers or other specialists, not government officials, people who had or were
                    working in the field, and they would go around and visit their counterparts in
                    the dairy industry, whatever, and advise them what they were doing wrong and
                    what they could do better. However, in a lot of instances they come unprepared
                    for what they were seeing. I recall a dairy delegation, actually had to do with
                    cheese making, and they wrote a report after their visit. I had seen them once
                    and then had nothing to do with them, they were out in the countryside. Some
                    months later I got a copy of their report which was filled with suggestions and
                    observations that were either totally silly or self-evident. For instance, one
                    suggestion was that the Kyrgyz need more modern equipment. They should have
                    milking machines here and there. Or their barns should be air-conditioned. These
                    were things that the Kyrgyz knew but were totally unrealistic, far beyond their
                    means. I had sent this report back to Washington and a lot of people had a good
                    chuckle over it. The report among other things listed ways that cheese could be
                    used in the Kyrgyz diet and had a recipe for cheese fondue which said to take
                    half a pound of Swiss cheese and a glass of white wine, all things that the
                    Kyrgyz peasant never even heard of. While that was a little far out and a little
                    silly, it did typify the approach a lot of these people coming to Kyrgyzstan and
                    looking around and dropping off their advice and leaving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically they were bringing what they did back at home
                        and saying do it our way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Right. At first the Kyrgyz were very flattered with all of this
                    attention and they saw dollar signs floating in the air whenever one of these
                    delegations came through. But, when the delegations didn't leave behind a pile
                    of money and when they left behind a lot of totally irrelevant advice, the
                    Kyrgyz began to get a little annoyed. I talked to many Kyrgyz officials who
                    said, “Look, we really appreciate the attention but we don't have time to talk
                    to all of these delegations.” And you know how Americans are, you get a chairman
                    of a small company in Ohio and he has been put on an official delegation and he
                    comes to me and says, “Well, I would like to see the president and the prime
                    minister and the minister of agriculture.” For a while we managed to get them
                    rather high level meetings but the Kyrgyz soon learned what the score was.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>But, a part from that there was a lot of useful aid, of course. There was surplus
                    grain that was donated. We gave very crucial advice to a very crucial segment of
                    Kyrgyzstan's budding industry, water power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was also thinking not only water power, but water,
                        itself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, you are right. That is one thing I talked to the Kyrgyz endlessly
                    about. The whole concept of water as an exploitable resource which was one of
                    Kyrgyzstan's riches. They had gotten used to this Soviet approach that we are
                    all one big happy family, so whatever Uzbekistan gets from Kyrgyzstan that
                    doesn't matter because we are all Soviet brothers. But, after the Soviet Union
                    fell apart, Uzbekistan had its gold within its borders, which it could extract
                    and export at will. Kazakhstan had its oil and gas, to say nothing about
                    enormous territory to grow wheat on. The Kyrgyz had basically only the water. It
                    is very rich in water resources. Perhaps second only to Russia in all of the
                    Soviet Union. But, they looked on their water, which was flowing right into
                    Uzbekistan, which was irrigating all of those vast cotton fields, not as a
                    resource but something that came from God and just flowed down. We tried to tell
                    them that their water was a resource and they should get some quid pro quo for
                    it.</p>
                <p>When I say hydroelectric, one of the most useful ideas was brought forth by an
                    AID sponsored hydroelectric group that pointed out to me, and I from then on
                    used it with every Kyrgyz that had anything to do with the economy, that
                    Kyrgyzstan not only let the flow into Uzbekistan but it regulated that flow in
                    such a way as to lose not only the water but what the water could do for
                    Kyrgyzstan. In other words, the water was dammed up in the winter so that it
                    didn't flow when it wasn't of use for the Uzbek cotton. Of course, when the
                    water is dammed up and not flowing you can't produce hydroelectric power from
                    it, the way their system was set up. So, at the very time that they need the
                    electric power in the winter to run the heaters to heat the country, the water
                    couldn't flow. In the spring, when they lifted the sluices and let the water go
                    through, that was when they didn't need the electric power in such big
                    quantities. So, what they really needed was a dam further up stream so they
                    could let the water flow down to the second dam and have the electric power
                    produced up stream. I don't know where that stands now but it would be a major
                    addition to their economy. It was costing them tens of millions of dollars to
                    irrigate Uzbekistan at no profit to Kyrgyzstan.</p>

                <p>HURWITZ: All I had to do was to pick up the phone. I could see anybody I wanted.
                    Before my first year was over the president and I had a very good relationship.
                    I spoke very good Russian at that time. I would see him maybe once a month for
                    lunch. He had me out to his hunting lodge three times. He would call me up and
                    say, “Come to lunch..” We would go to either his office or his home. I don't
                    know if it did any good though because towards the end that changed. We can get
                    to that later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I recall correctly, our embassy was on Dzerzhinsky

                <p>HURWITZ: They have renamed it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were really just down the street from the old KGB.
                        What was your relationship with the security forces there? What were they
                        like at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: The relationship was very good. There was a very close relationship
                    between the station chief and the old KGB. We were giving them a lot of advise.
                    We put together and trained their presidential security staff. We gave them
                    equipment and were working closely with them on drugs. We had a lot of drug
                    delegations from DEA through. Security relationship was very good. There was
                    absolutely no harassment from their side and no bugs or anything like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of the Russians while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: The whole subject of Russian-Kyrgyz relationship is interesting. When I
                    got to Kyrgyzstan I had expected to see what you think of when you think of a
                    colonial situation—the mother country sort of dominating a colony. You would
                    expect to see Kyrgyz street sweepers, Kyrgyz truck drivers and Kyrgyz plumbers
                    and maids and dishwashers, and Russians walking around in suits and briefcases.
                    It was exactly the opposite. The whole Kyrgyz-Russian relationship was
                    historically developed in an unusual way from the standpoint of a colony. When
                    the Russians got there sort of mid-19th century, there was virtually nothing.
                    The Kyrgyz were largely pastoral, sheep herders, etc. The Russians brought in
                    all the labor force, the technicians, so you always had a Russian, blue collar
                    working class there often doing menial work in the cities. Then the general
                    scheme was carried on by Stalin. The Russians were obviously calling all the
                    shots and had the power in the area, but there was this union of brotherly
                    republics and they needed to have them focus on Kyrgyzstan's sovereignty, if not
                    independence. So, in all the ministries, in all of the government organizations,
                    the top dog was usually a Kyrgyz who did what his Russian masters told him,
                    obviously, but it was the Kyrgyz who walked around carrying the briefcases with
                    the fedora hats and pens in the pocket. That has continued. So, the teachers,
                    most of the bureaucracy, except for the very top behind the scenes, was Kyrgyz.
                    The Kyrgyz always walked around well dress and it was the Russian street
                    cleaners and Russian gardeners, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, also you had the feeling it was the Russians who kept
                        the engines going, ran the little shops and all that sort of stuff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, yes. So, that first of all defined a lot of the life in urban
                    Kyrgyzstan. The Russians were essential to making the place go. When your
                    telephone wouldn't work, when your plumbing went bad, it was always a Russian
                    who did it. I think the Kyrgyz realized that and although you had the young
                    firebrands saying, “Russians get out,” most of them realized that the Russians
                    were very necessary plus which the Kyrgyz are just basically just extremely
                    tolerant, quiet people. They are very reasonable people. The feeling between the
                    Russians and Kyrgyz was basically quite good. Plus which the Kyrgyz never had
                    much of a developed culture of their own. They will argue with that, of course.
                    But, as a basically nomadic nation they didn't have much time to build up a
                    culture or great religious or artistic tradition. There was no great center of
                    culture, which was different than the case in Uzbekistan, by the way, which for
                    centuries was the center of Central Asia. A lot of the Persian-language writers
                    like Babur were really not Persian but Uzbek. This was not the case in
                    Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyz always looked to Russia for its cultural roots, its
                    language—most city dwellers in Kyrgyzstan do much better in Russian than in
                    Kyrgyz. So, this naturally tolerant attitude plus all they knew they owed to
                    Russia in terms of culture, economy and infrastructure, meant the relationship
                    was good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Russian ambassador doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, the Russian ambassador and the whole embassy was largely busy with
                    handling the exodus. I just said the relations were good, but I think the
                    Russians saw the handwriting on the wall, that the opportunities for Russians
                    would no longer be the same. They felt they were living in a foreign country and
                    a lot of them wanted to return. They could be the plumbers and carpenters, but
                    they couldn't be much else and that meant a lot of the intellectuals wanted to
                    leave. So, the Russian embassy was tied up with that. The initial outflow
                    subsided and I don't know what it is now.</p>
                <p>After the Union fell apart, I think the Russian attitude towards this has gone
                    through some ups and downs. I think there was a time when they felt they would
                    make the best of this and try to forge something out of the break up. It won't
                    be the Soviet Union but it will be something that we at least can control. But,
                    as the economic problems mounted in the Soviet Union they realized they couldn't
                    do this. They didn't have the resources or couldn't pay enough attention to
                    keeping these far flung parts of the former Union more or less under their
                    control. Certain things, however, in Kyrgyzstan they were very concerned about
                    and that was China. While I was there, and I think it is still the case, it was
                    Soviet troops on the long border with China. The Soviets, more or less, ran that
                    whole border and security operation from the standpoint of China. Now, that is
                    in their interests and they won't give that up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I talked to the ministry of foreign affairs, people
                        expressed concern over two groups. One was the Chinese, because there are
                        just so many of them that they really didn't want to let them get in because
                        the Kyrgyz are only four and a half million and the Chinese could just out
                        populate them in a very short time. The other one was Iranian
                        fundamentalists coming in there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: We were concerned about both. I think the Chinese were not that
                    interested. I think the Chinese were sort of a bugaboo and you always had
                    stories about the Chinese coming in and buying up property and houses. I think
                    that was exaggerated. The Chinese are concerned with the area only in a sense it
                    is next to their Sinkiang province, next to the Uighurs in China talking about
                    Eastern Turkestan. In fact, there was a large Uighur population in Kyrgyzstan
                    which has been there for generations and some of them were linking up with the
                    Chinese Uighurs. So, this was a concern from the Chinese standpoint.</p>
                <p>Another problem the Kyrgyz had with the Chinese, a more realistic one, was
                    Chinese nuclear tests nearby. But, I think basically the Chinese provided a lot
                    of cheap consumer goods that flooded Kyrgyzstan at the time which they wouldn't
                    be able to get from Russia any more. How they bought these things, I don't know.
                    There was a lot of trade in metals and things like that were smuggled out of
                    Russia through Kyrgyzstan or the Kyrgyz just had sitting there from the Russian
                    time—copper and that sort of stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about concern about religion from Iran? When I was
                        there from what I could observe there wasn't much religion there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: No, no, they are very irreligious, as I say. They never paid much
                    attention to religion. There was a little more attention to it. Certainly, they
                    made some of the Muslim holidays national holidays. The Iranians set up an
                    embassy and at one point had opened an information office that sold magazines
                    and books which nobody bought. I looked through the window a number of times and
                    there was nobody in it. And, there was a visit by the foreign minister and by
                    Rafsanjani. But, I don't think they are really taking off. The Iranians have
                    their own problems. I think the Iranians are more interested in countries closer
                    to them like Azerbaijan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, the Turks initially were enormously interested in bringing back
                    their long lost little brothers from Central Asia. The Turks were very active.
                    They had a big embassy there and a lot of educational programs. But, I think,
                    they too, initially had grandiose ideas which didn't come to pass. First of all
                    because Turkey economically couldn't do as much for the area as it wanted and
                    secondly because the Kyrgyz, at least, were not that interested. The Kyrgyz,
                    first of all, had enough little brotherism in their relationship with Russia in
                    the past and secondly, the Kyrgyz were really looking beyond Turkey. Turkey was
                    trying to present itself as the West to them, but they weren't interested in
                    that as time when on. They realized that things were happening much further west
                    then Turkey. I recall in May, 1992, a big Turkish trade delegation came over and
                    started handing out their cards. It turned out that virtually every one of them
                    was really an affiliate of an American firm and that all the cards were in
                    English. Everybody spoke English even though the Turks had told the Kyrgyz that
                    they had to learn Turkish as their key to the Western world. Well, they weren't
                    interested in learning Turkish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Japanese interested there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: No. They were very good in terms of aid. The Japanese like the Swiss,
                    who didn't have a lot to offer but paid a lot of attention of Kyrgyzstan, as did
                    the Danes and the Dutch, were good on aid and I think there is potential there.
                    But, the Japanese are very crafty, in the business sense, and they are not
                    interested in something that doesn't have much potential. I think they made that
                    decision. They didn't open an embassy there. They saw that this place was no
                    market for anything they produced and didn't produce anything they needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If nothing else they could have some great resorts
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, the whole question of tourism is one that we talked about and
                    listened to foreigners talk about. It is very difficult. What we told them to
                    focus on is the sort of eco tourism—bird watchers, people who like to go to the
                    outer limits like mountain climbers—but there is a dreadful lack of facilities
                    there. The Kyrgyz used to say Issyk Kul was a marvelous place and Europeans
                    should come there in droves. However, the accommodations were so disastrously
                    bad, even by Soviet standards. It is so hard to get to and even if you begin to
                    have reasonably good transportation, international flights, why would people
                    want to go there, the average blue-haired lady, tourist type with tied shoes. It
                    just takes a long time to develop that sort of stuff and you have to have side
                    interests or sights to see. You just can't come and stay in a hotel and have a
                    lake. People come and you have to restaurants around and other facilities. And,
                    that would just take too long. But, as I kept telling them, “Look, your
                    mountains aren't going away, you have time to play with this. In the meantime,
                    put ads in the “Audubon Magazine”, put ads in other speciality magazines. They
                    were beginning to get hunters, people who were going for various kinds of game
                    that you don't find except in those areas. They were getting a few bird watchers
                    and advertising for these horse tours through the mountains. Here again, it is
                    not big scale, but can be a beginning.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about relations with Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and
                        Tajikistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: The relations with Kazakhstan were good, they are similar in many ways.
                    Language is extremely close. The border is right there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really don't know it is there, at least in our
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I think that is still the same. It is like going to New York from New
                    Jersey.</p>
                <p>The relationship with the Uzbeks has always been strained. There is a sort of
                    traditional animosity there which exploded in 1990 in that Osh incident in which
                    200 or so people were killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: That was over land rights and water rights in the Fergana Valley. Osh is
                    the second city in Kyrgyzstan which is off in the western part of the lowlands.
                    Its population is about 50 percent ethnic Uzbek. I don't recall the exact
                    details, but poor Kyrgyz squatters came in and just took over some land which
                    belonged to some ethnic Uzbek farmers and you had an explosion. That settled
                    down, although it is an issue and there is some tension there. Then, also during
                    my tenure, Uzbekistan shut off the supply of natural gas. They supply part of
                    Kyrgyzstan's natural gas and shut off deliveries because they had not been paid.
                    There was some harassment and they set up a real border control setup at that
                    point. But, that passed over all right.</p>
                <p>Tajikistan, of course, was a problem. The same thing holds there with the border
                    being very porous having been really non-existent during Soviet times. You have
                    a lot of ethnic Tajiks living in Kyrgyzstan and vice-a-versa. So, if things get
                    upset in Tajikistan then there is the question of the problem spilling over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there there was a guerrilla war going
                        on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: There was fighting in Tajikistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: That was over factions. That never extended into Kyrgyzstan. The
                    Russians had sent in peacekeepers and Kyrgyzstan had sent a brigade to help out.
                    I think the Kazakhs were also involved.</p>
                <p>Afghanistan was also a problem because you get arms and drugs coming into
                    Kyrgyzstan and that is part of the problem now. The only stories you read about
                    Kyrgyzstan in the American press have to do with drugs and drug traffic. That
                    whole area now is becoming a transit point. It has never been a big consumption
                    area, but it is a transit point. The drugs come up from Afghanistan into
                    Tajikistan. From there they go up the road to Osh, on the western border of
                    Kyrgyzstan, and then into Russia and across to Uzbekistan. I am sure some of it
                    gets diverted, but very little of it. Kyrgyzstan, itself, could be, has been a
                    primary for growing poppies. The meadows just before you get into the highest
                    portion of the mountains are just covered with poppies. Not the opium poppies
                    but the climate and terrain is find for opium poppies. The Chu Valley, which is
                    the valley between...the Chu River is the border between Kyrgyzstan and
                    Kazakhstan...that whole valley is the world's biggest producer of wild cannabis.
                    In the Soviet times they had the facilities to keep track of this...helicopters,
                    train a large force...but now they are having trouble keeping track of that.
                    That is one of the areas that we cooperate with them very closely.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this much of a concern of yours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, yes. It was beginning to build up. It has gotten worse now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude of the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: They were serious about it, but they were strapped for resources,
                    trained people, etc. We did a lot of training in the United States and in
                    Kyrgyzstan we had all kinds of seminars—the USG, not the embassy. Every time
                    somebody from the Department, DEA or CIA came through on this issue we ran them
                    through the ministry of interior, the minister, himself, the vice president. I
                    think they are serious about it. In 1992 it was proposed legalizing the growing
                    of poppies for medicinal reasons, but the president said no, they didn't want to
                    have anything to do with it. We gave them a good pat on the back, and I am sure
                    it still holds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself in a position as an unofficial
                        adviser on things when they were setting up their government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, we advised through the means of sending out teams. AID put
                    together all kinds of programs, State did too, for individual ministries, for
                    banking people, for planning organizations. There was a great deal of that. I
                    did a great deal of talking from the president on down about general approaches
                    such as a free press. We talked to them very much on my level and AID groups who
                    brought out specialists, contractors, on the question of constitution. They were
                    working out a constitution. The whole question of human rights, on police
                    abuses, etc. We were talking to them constantly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned while you were there that things got more
                        difficult. What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes, towards the end. This all started up in perhaps late August,
                    September, 1994 and I left in October. The president simply lost patience with
                    various segments of the press that were being very critical. There were a number
                    of scandals about issues that had taken place pretty soon after independence.
                    The disappearance of some gold from their reserves. The letting of contracts for
                    gold mining, particularly. So, you had the press being critical and you had the
                    national assembly being extremely critical. The president decided that he liked
                    being president and there would be an election, I believe, in February, 1995, as
                    well as a national assembly election in November, 1994, so the president shut
                    down a newspaper and threatened to shut down another one and to put editors in
                    jail. Then he came out with a referendum as to whether there should be a totally
                    different parliament system. Instead of a one house system that there should be
                    a bicameral legislature and that the election procedure would be such that in
                    effect he would be in control. We tried to talk him out of it. I went to see him
                    constantly during the last couple of weeks. He invited me for a hunting session
                    with him with the head of the KGB or security services and the foreign minister,
                    and I couldn't budge him on it. And, indeed, things have developed that way now.
                    He has lost a little of the sheen of being the only island of democracy, as they
                    like to call themselves. I told them, “Look, you have very little going for you
                    except your reputation. This was the one thing that distinguished Kyrgyzstan
                    from being just another one of these backward little third world countries.” I
                    pointed things out to him which he should have understood. For example, he paid
                    a private visit to the United States in May, 1993, in connection with the Andre
                    Sakharov fund. Being himself a physicist he was a close friend of Sakharov's
                    widow; who has been living in the States and he came over to make a speech at
                    the National Academy of Sciences do in connection with Sakharov. He wanted
                    desperately during this visit to see the President. Well, we turned handsprings
                    in the embassy and in the Department... Strobe Talbott was very much in favor of
                    this, too...to try to get him in to see the President. This was during a period
                    of time when Clinton had not much to do with foreign policy, didn't seem to be
                    very interested in foreign policy. So, it worked out that Akayev was received in
                    his office by Vice President Gore and during that visit Clinton came in and they
                    had about 15 or 20 minutes, with lots of photos, of course, so he could say he
                    had been received by the President. Well, he was in seventh heaven. I kept
                    saying to him, “You see, when the president of Uzbekistan came here he only got
                    as high as Under Secretary of State. You have gotten in to see the President.
                    You know why? That is because you are a democratic country. You are bucking the
                    whole trend. You are proving that something can rise out of the ashes of the
                    Soviet Union.” And they ran on that and they ran with it. And, as I said before,
                    it meant a lot in terms of getting aid....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador is Rosa...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, it was Rosa Otunbayeva, but she is now foreign minister. She was a
                    strong ally of mine in trying to prevent this trend that we later saw. But, she
                    was more or less out of it. She was foreign minister and knew a lot about the
                    United States and lot about how the world reacts to things, but she was not
                    getting much in the way of attention from her president.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>I have not gone recently to the desk. I know the Department was disappointed with
                    what transpired at this point and I don't know where it stands now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the president already made his decision when you
                        left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Oh, yes. After my departure at some time they had their referendum and
                    you could certify it as being rather fairly carried out, but on the other hand,
                    votes in that part of the world for various reasons are not the same as in the
                    West. I was terribly disappointed. It was a complete reversal. It happened
                    rather suddenly. We tried very hard. There were messages that flew back and
                    forth. Even Clinton sent messages that were very harsh. But, it didn't turn him
                    around. One element that is relevant here was brought to our attention by the
                    most knowledgeable economic planner in Kyrgyzstan, a guy who really had some
                    experience with the West. He point blank said to us, “Look, you guys aren't
                    going to be around for a long time. Your aid, despite your best intentions, is
                    going to drop off. So, no matter how much you think we are nice guys, you are
                    not going to do a heck of a lot for us. Besides we have the World Bank, the IMF,
                    the Japanese, who pay a lot less attention to these political factors. So, we
                    thank you for your help and advice but it really is not crucial.” And he is
                    undoubtedly right. I don't know what our aid level is now but willy nilly it is
                    going to come down or has come down.</p>
                <p>The sad part of it is, the Kyrgyz being as tolerant and easy going and basically
                    fair minded, I think, as they are, they could have pulled this off. In other
                    words they could have had a democratic society that would not have...as the
                    Soviets always say and as the Kyrgyz and other people who are about to impose
                    harsh restrictions always claim, you know, we have to do it in the name of
                    stability, we can't have this dissent. You in the West can afford the luxury of
                    dissent, but we can't here. We are new at democracy. Well, they were new at
                    democracy, that's true, but they could have made it work because of their
                    general attitude towards each other and towards working together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the nationalist wing within the body politic or
                        only doing business in the Kyrgyz language and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Initially you had a bit of that but they realized it was a non-starter.
                    They were having trouble expressing themselves on many, many subjects in Kyrgyz.
                    This may change over a generation, and maybe it will. As a matter of fact, as of
                    now the ruling class is much more comfortable in Russian and dealing with the
                    issues they have to deal with in Russian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I notice as I walked down the street I would see Kyrgyz
                        talking to each other and almost invariably it obviously was in
                        Russian.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. Their initial access to the outside world, and this will continue
                    for a while, has to be in Russian. When the opportunity seemed to make it
                    appropriate and useful I did say, “Hey, look, don't bad mouth Russian as a
                    language or as a culture. You will notice when we bring an interpreter over on
                    any subject here, we don't bring in a Kyrgyz interpreter, there is no such
                    thing. We bring a Russian interpreter. By the same token you have to recognize
                    that.” And I think they do.</p>
                <p>Initially the nationalist thing happened and probably always does when you have
                    the first blush of independence, but that has fairly well died out, as has any
                    animosity towards the Russians. As I used to tell them, “Look, you are now
                    number one, there is no reason to push anybody's nose in it. Nobody is
                    challenging you. There is no reason to get rid of Russians. You are in control.
                    Use the Russians.” And, I think that is what they are doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1994 and then had about a year back in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: I had home leave and then started this job in the historian's office on
                    November 1, 1994.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in the historian's office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Well, I think the idea was that somebody along the line probably felt
                    the professional civil service historians, a lot of them had been working there
                    for years and years, needed a little more of an influence from people who had
                    been out in the field and had actually done a lot of this negotiating or
                    operating in an embassy that the documents they were dealing with covered. So, I
                    was brought in. Mike Joyce was there and Marsh was there, and Jerry Monroe,
                    Harmon Kirby, and a couple of other people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were working on the Foreign Relations Series?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HURWITZ: Yes. All of us had differing assignments depending on our specialities.
                    My first assignment was looking at the US-Afghanistan Relations volume, which
                    was already in gallery form and to make any comments that I might have thought
                    necessary. My second assignment there was to go through raw files of documents
                    relating to our relations with the Soviet Union from 1964-68 and to choose
                    documents that should be included in the volume of US Foreign Relations. It was
                    very interesting work because I knew all the names signing the cables. Actually
                    it was a period when I had absolutely nothing to do with Soviet affairs, so I
                    didn't find my own name, but everybody else I knew was there.</p>
