                <p>AMBASSADOR PAUL H. ROBINSON, JR.</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Willis Armstrong </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a interview with Ambassador Paul Robinson, who was
                        ambassador in Canada from 1981 until 1985. Paul, what got you interested in
                        being ambassador to Canada in the first place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Well, it wasn't quite that, Bill. Before the election of 1980, in
                    October, I was asked by Dan Terra, who later became Ambassador for Cultural
                    Affairs—really an ambassador-at-large—would I take a position in a Reagan
                    Administration if then-Governor Reagan was elected. I said that I would be
                    interested in a major position. I would consider a major position or want to be
                    considered for that or nothing at all. I was asked to put down a list, which was
                    a very short list in my case, which included Canada and Secretary of the Navy.
                    And, of course, I was greatly honored to represent the President in Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did your name go to the Senate, for example, and then
                        how did the procedure go with the Senate? Was it all comfortable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: It was seventeen-to-nothing committee vote and the voice vote on the
                    floor of the Senate. I was posted at Canada on the 15th of July 1981. And I was
                    there until September 9, 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the way you were treated by the
                        senators? I guess there was then a Republican majority in the Senate, wasn't
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes, there was. I was very fairly treated. And even Claiborne Pell,
                    whose politics are certainly different than mine—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or mine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes, he is a very nice man. He was very helpful.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Senator Percy from Illinois was the Chairman of Foreign Relations Committee, and
                    he had been extremely difficult, even though we were both Republicans before I
                    got to the Senate, because he had foolishly made his own selection without
                    checking with the White House. And when it became apparent that I was the
                    nominee and hit the papers, he exploded. But he seemed to think, of course, that
                    he was running foreign affairs for the United States. He hadn't read his
                    Constitution, I'm afraid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some senators haven't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: But he was, in fact, helpful in the end. But I knew that he had been
                    working behind the scenes against me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's fascinating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you first encountered the State Department, how did
                        you feel about the career people and the desk, and how were you handled in
                        the bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Well, I was handled very well. In fact, I came to State for some
                    briefings pending my hearings at the Senate with some preconceived ideas, which
                    were largely wrong. I thought that the State Department people would be largely
                    useless and wouldn't really know how to conduct foreign affairs. They may well
                    have thought the same thing of me.</p>
                <p>But what happened was that I was impressed, very much so, by the people I met. I
                    thought they were dedicated. I thought they were able. I never had any problems
                    in my subsequent four years and two months in Canada with State Department
                    people. They were, I think, largely of the other party, but they nonetheless
                    were good Americans. I was proud to be with them. We worked very well
                    together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is, of course, what I heard from them, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Is it really? Is that right? [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] A mutually satisfactory arrangement.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what did they tell you in 1981 were the chief
                        problems with Canada at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: I not only traveled in Canada for pleasure, but I had some business
                    dealings there going back to 1974, in December of '74, when I first went to
                    Ottawa on business.</p>
                <p>But there were several. One, of course, was the FIRA, Foreign Investment Review
                    Agency, which is really active in restraint of trade in trying to keep American
                    and other foreign investments out. Subsequently, the Trudeau government, at my
                    urging, appointed Ed Lumley and Clay Ducfera (phonetic). And then Mulroney came
                    in. He abolished it.</p>
                <p>The other was a national energy program, which confiscated our assets
                    retroactively; that is to say, those who had invested in Canadian oil and energy
                    shares. And then I wasn't able to accomplish the removal of under Trudeau, but
                    it was also abolished by Mulroney when he was elected.</p>
                <p>The third one, of course, was the acid rain problem, where, of course, we were
                    polluting Canada. But what isn't realized is that Canada was polluting the
                    United States, as well. Half of Canada's air pollution is generated in Canada.
                    And a quarter of our pollution comes from Canada in the New England states.</p>
                <p>So it is clearly a serious problem, and I wasn't able to solve that exactly. But
                    one of my last acts was to set up and get approval for a special envoys to deal
                    with this problem. And I did in face of White House opposition. They didn't
                    think the President would go along, but the President did go along. And
                    primarily I would say because he wanted to help Brian Mulroney. He never felt
                    that the acid rain problem was quite as serious or could be approached at that
                    time because we didn't have enough information. Nonetheless, he did appoint
                    these envoys.</p>
                <p>And finally, Bill, a fourth problem between the two was one that I raised, and
                    that was defense. Canada's expenditures towards defense were 1.8% of gross
                    national product. I never questioned for a moment Canada's loyalty to the NATO
                    alliance or to the defense of our continent, but it was clear that they had to
                    do more. I got them to turn the corner, not really demonstratively, but yet up
                    to 2.2% when I left. At that time, we were at 6.5%, going to 7%.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we went higher.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Up into 1984, '85.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And had, I think, a very important impact on the general
                        international situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: NATO had agreed to 3%, you see, so Canada was really far below.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they always have been below. I had experience with
                        Canada in my day in regard to their defense budget.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, one of the things that you have been described as
                        being in Canadian press is the godfather of the Free Trade Agreement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Well, that's—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell us something about how that developed? That
                        was not an immediate problem when you went there because—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Trudeau was in power. But after Mulroney came in, they
                        took a different look at it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Well, that's right. The first working day of 1983, in a bubble I
                    announced that we were going to reinitiate the Free Trade Agreement, which
                    you'll remember, of course, failed in 1911 in Sir Wilfrid Laurier's government
                    fell on the question of no truck nor trade with the Yankee.</p>
                <p>I said I wanted to leave something that would live beyond all of our service in
                    Canada. So I entered into a program where I had leading people—Tom Bakeele
                    (phonetic), for instance; Jake Warren, a former Canadian ambassador to the
                    United States; the Chamber of Commerce man, Sam Hughes. And then we called on
                    Gerry Regan, then in charge of Trade and External Affairs, and Ed Lumley, who
                    was the liberal minister at that time for trade as well. We knew, of course,
                    Bill, that it wouldn't do any good unless it was initiated by the Canadians. It
                    wouldn't fly at all because we would be accused of gobbling up Canada.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>There was a meeting in May of '83 with Gerry Regan. His staff was opposed to this
                    concept, but I noticed Regan was taking it in. As a result, subsequently, and
                    meeting with Bill Brock and Gerry Regan, we decided to proceed with some kind of
                    a freer trade agreement. They were afraid to say free at that time; they said
                    freer trade agreement on a sectorial basis, product by product or industry by
                    industry. And so that the liberals did, in fact, make a turn towards this. And
                    then, of course, when Brian Mulroney was elected in September of '84, it was
                    full speed ahead on freer trade. Later they had the guts, and we had the guts,
                    to just call it free trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The election of Mulroney was in '84, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: I think it was September 4, 1984.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember watching the returns.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: That was the biggest landslide election in the history of Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Canada when Diefenbaker won his landslide.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Really?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, in 1958.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: You know what Diefenbaker said? One of his greatest quotes is he said,
                    “Polls are for dogs.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] That's a nice line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes. It is interesting that Diefenbaker, a conservative, is actually
                    far more anti-American than the liberals were at the time that I was there.
                    Trudeau was most helpful to me. I think you could say that what he had done,
                    intended to do, he had already done. And I don't know if that was best for
                    Canada or not, but he was—in fact, I have opinions of that. But he was very
                    fair.</p>
                <p>It brings a point up too, Bill. I had the honor of serving with four of Canada's
                    eighteen prime ministers: Trudeau, Turner, Mulroney, as prime minister, and Joe
                    Clark as Secretary of State for External Affairs. And I liked them all.</p>

                <p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>

                        you left, in regard to the Free Trade Agreement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Well, very much so. Of course, as you know, I didn't negotiate. I think
                    it was very well done. I think the key was Baker as Secretary of Treasury. STR
                    was not—I mean, certainly they did the hard foot-slogging work. But Baker was
                    the one that provided the clout that got it through. Wilson, on the Canadian
                    side, I think, was they key man. In fact, Mike Wilson and I met before all of
                    this ended. I said, “Look, what should we do?” We raised over some of the things
                    which I said I would pass on to Washington, which I did do. And I remember
                    publishing was one of them. And I said, “How does this look to you, Mike?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well, I think we can work it out.” He said, “You can press this,
                    and don't press that,” and that sort of thing. So I was able to be a good
                    messenger. I reported all that duly to the Special Trade Representative's
                    office. So I played a marginal role in the actual negotiations.</p>

                <p>Now the acid rain question, you know, is still, it seems to me, scientifically up
                    in the air. Did you feel that the Canadians were unwilling to accept the
                    possible scientific evidence would go against their political convictions on
                    this matter?</p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes. I mean, clearly, it was. I mean, they liked to kick us in the
                    shins, you know—the press, particularly. I think it was blown out of proportion,
                    but it nonetheless is one of those realities of public life. I mean, it didn't
                    matter what the facts were. It was a real political issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It certainly was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: And it is.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: It remains so. I think it's mitigated somewhat. I do think that
                    President Bush and his administration would do more. I know that President
                    Reagan wasn't convinced that we had found out how SO2 and NOX got into the
                    atmosphere and then fell to the earth as acid rain. I think the Bush people are
                    more likely to do something about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I read an article recently in the Washington Times by
                        Warren Brooks, who is one of my favorite commentators and analysts. He is a
                        superb analyst. I will try to get you a copy of this. It raises the question
                        as to how much money it takes, really, to have an impact on acid rain, and
                        is it worth it. In the sense that—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: That's incredible.</p>

                <p>ROBINSON: Conflicting. You know, if we spend, say, ten, fifteen, twenty billion,
                    and at the end of the day, find out it doesn't work, then where are we?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've talked to a lot of people under the Reagan

                        about this issue, and we were never really convinced that the scientific

                    Illinois is prepared to join with ESU and the Atlantic Council on this lexicon
                    thing. How much with the Soviets, how much money is involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me pause a minute. [Tape recorded turned off]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>We are back on the air. Paul, you've had a lot of experience with Canada, both
                    during your ambassadorship and since. What are your views on the general nature
                    of Canadian-American relationships and what you see coming in the future?</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>ROBINSON: Well, I think that, of course, the average American doesn't give the
                    time of day to it. They take it for granted, the relationship, as being good.
                    And it is basically good. And, frankly, it will always basically good if we pay
                    attention to Canadian needs and sensibilities and if they, on their part, behave
                    in a similar manner. They also take us for granted, you know, Bill, in questions
                    like defense, for instance.</p>
                <p>But, I mean, if you or I have a business in Australia or New Zealand—if you are
                    down under, and you look up, and you say, “Well, I can't see the difference
                    between Americans and Canadians.” We look down, we see Australians and New
                    Zealanders. We say, “Well, there isn't any difference.” Well, of course, there
                    is in both cases. There are no two people in this world closer to each other
                    than the United States and Canada, not only by blood and by language, but by
                    basic outlooks on life. That doesn't mean there aren't differences; there are.
                    We, as Americans, want to make sure that we are aware of these.</p>
                <p>I'm an American of Canadian descent. It sustained me in many a time when the
                    press was all over me at the beginning. At the end, I made really more friends
                    than I thought, than I could in the press and beyond that. After two and a half
                    years, I think I beat them. They were writing good things about me. And I was
                    really wondering whether I was doing my job or not. Because they were actually
                    agreeing with me and saying nice things. And I thought, “Well, I must be doing
                    something wrong.”</p>
                <p>But they find it easy to criticize us. And, of course, as you know, 80% of the
                    population within a hundred miles of the border, they can't help but be informed
                    on what we are doing or polluted by what our television produces. They asked me
                    once, some of them, “What can we do to limit the influence of American
                    television?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I don't know. But let me know so we can do the same thing in the United
                    States.”</p>
                <p>But they do have—I think you have to treat this—I found that the way to work with
                    Canadians was to treat them straight on and be consistent. It's always better to
                    be consistently wrong than right sometimes and wrong some other time. But it is
                    better to be consistently right, and I think I was. And I think, in fact,
                    President Reagan wrote me a letter, which I have framed in my office in
                    Illinois, saying, “The relationship now between the United States and Canada is
                    greater than at any time since the end of the Second World War.” And he said,
                    “You can be proud that it happened on your watch.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that's true. I would confirm that in my own
                        experience with Canadian affairs, which began in 1958. So I would say
                        relationships are currently very good.</hi>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>What do you see as happening in the Free Trade area? Do you think that this
                    agreement is going to survive? You know, all the media in Canada now talk about
                    are how many jobs are lost or many plants are closed. And, of course,
                    rationalization was bound to occur. But they don't emphasize, or as a Canadian
                    told me the other day, “They don't emphasize all the new jobs and all the new
                    investment.”</p>
                <p>ROBINSON: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you see this? And this relates to the media, of
                        course, who are always very difficult in Canada.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As they were with you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes. Speaking of the media, I want to say that the U.S. press is
                    malicious. The Canadian press is stupid, because they don't do their homework.
                    And they are, basically, anti-American—the press is. The Canadian people
                    aren't.</p>
                <p>But an answer to that is that it's estimated by the best judges—and, of course,
                    that doesn't mean that it's right—that trade will be enhanced in the next five
                    years by 15%. Right now, as you know, it is over 150 billion. The biggest trade
                    relationship in the world, twice what our trade is with Japan. Over the next
                    five years, 15% at least increase. And a 1,500,000 jobs, of which 500,000 would
                    be Canadian jobs, new jobs. That won't stop the press. But I think we will see
                    something even better than that.</p>
                <p>Back to the press and the letter—as I mentioned, the President's letter. Brian
                    Mulroney's office said, “What kind of a letter do you want the prime minister to
                    send you on your departure?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a delicate question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes. It was Fred Doucet, the prime minister's chief of staff. And he
                    said, “Do you want us to tell the truth, or do you want something that we can
                    release to the press?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, have him write the truth,” which was a very kind letter, also
                    framed in my office. But the thing is it was positive, and it would have
                    embarrassed the conservative government had it got into the press. I was told in
                    no uncertain terms that I cannot release it to the press. I could frame it, put
                    it in my office in Illinois, but I couldn't let anybody see it otherwise.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>And that shows you how delicate the relationship is on the Canadian side, that
                    the opposition would have got a hold of it, socialists and maybe the liberals
                    and said, “Well, there goes the prime minister again playing up to the
                    Americans.” I think that is a sensitivity which we Americans have to recognize
                    exists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you think we can get more attention to the reality
                        of Canadian-American relations by Americans? You know, I have felt we were
                        afflicted by apathy and ignorance to an incredible degree.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: I agree. Well, first we could have Louis Real (phonetic) again do a
                    northwest rebellion, and then we would pay attention to it. But that's been over
                    a hundred—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our new separatist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: You know the disturbing thing is that Americans would ask me not about
                    Trudeau, but about Margaret Trudeau. I mean, it just struck me—I mean, our view
                    of Canada is that it is very cold up there, and that Margaret Trudeau still
                    lives up there. And then they don't have the slightest idea—we don't have the
                    slightest idea about the separatist thing, which, of course, is a great danger.
                    They ask you a question.</p>
                <p>You know, I have suggested to Derek Burney before he became Canadian ambassador,
                    that they buy a section of Time magazine and put it in there, like Saudi
                    Arabians do, and just put it in there. I don't care what it costs. I mean, that
                    at least Americans would recognize what Canada is and what it is doing.</p>
                <p>The only other thing I think could be through television. If we can generate the
                    interest, I think the Public Broadcasting System might do more on Canadian
                    subjects. I know my daughter is working with a program called the Editors in
                    Montreal. She is an intern there while she is at McGill. And that program
                    appears on some 300 channels in the United States, PBS channels. So not in every
                    case, but oftentimes, I know I appeared on it. And a friend of mine in Topeka
                    saw it. So that sort of thing, I think, would help.</p>

                <p>The media in Canada—we've talked about the print media. How do you feel about CBC
                    and the Canadian television? Did they treat you any worse or any better?</p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Well, they tried to, but they couldn't, you see, because I was on
                    television. They can't just quote you when you are on television. In fact, CBC
                    has asked me to be on a panel, which I'll be glad to do, on December 9th in
                    Vancouver, which will be Canada coast-to-coast in Canada with P. R. Burton, a
                    good New York Times man, Malcolm, and a few other people. But, you see, they
                    can't misquote me when I'm on television. They would often throw in these high
                    hard ones, you know. They would dwell on some issues which were almost trivial.
                    I think they liked to interview me because they got a straight answer, and they
                    got a story.</p>
                <p>I gave over 150 speeches in Canada. I stopped counting at 156. I was on radio and
                    television at least as many times and more times than that. I've traveled
                    250,000 miles. So there was hardly any—I think I've traveled Canada more in my
                    tenure there than any politician. I was everywhere including—</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Well, the interviewers were sometimes hostile, but they were relatively
                    fair. They had to be because the people are watching it.</p>

                <p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other subjects that you think are important? How do
                        you feel about French Canada? Have you been around French Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Quite a bit. I must say that my attitude changed on that subject. Of
                    course, I detest separatism as much as the Canadians, or good Canadians, do. I
                    was invited by the Levesque government on November 11th, I remember, 1981,
                    Remembrance Day, our Veteran's Day. I laid the wreath in Quebec City. Levesque
                    was, I thought, a despicable man. He refused to wear the king's uniform during
                    the war. He came in the U.S. Army as a cameraman. In his office was no maple
                    leaf flag. He didn't attend the ceremony. There was the Quebec Flag. I called on
                    Ryan, who was also a separatist, but a responsible one, I think, if there is
                    such a thing as a responsible, I don't think there is. But he at least had a
                    maple leaf flag in his office. Levesque had pretenses of being a great friend of
                    Americans and would join NATO when they were independent.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I was asked what I thought of the separatist movement by these separatists. And I
                    said to them, “Whereas that is entirely a Canadian matter (I didn't say Quebec
                    matter; a Canadian matter), the United States favored a strong and united
                    Canada,” which, of course, didn't go down very well with them. And six months
                    later, I took the trouble of having it made official U.S. policy. And that's
                    what it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had been said before in an earlier day when I was
                        familiar with it. It was said particularly at the time when the separatists
                        were raging in some various kinds of terrorism and violence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes. In '71.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, '71. Late '60s and '71. It was a very tight time, and
                        they had a very hard time up there. I remember going to the NATO meeting in
                        '63 in Ottawa, and there were extraordinary security precautions taken by
                        the Canadians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that time. I know the American delegation was horrified
                        because, as a member of the delegation, I wouldn't stay at the hotel. I
                        didn't want to pay the price at the Ch�teau Laurier. I went and stayed in a
                        motel over in Eastview in the French part of town.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Really?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. They had good steaks, anyway. It's a place I
                        knew.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Do you consider separatism still a threat?</p>
                <p>ROBINSON: It is always a dormant threat. You know, this last election, the
                    liberals won with ninety-three seats to twenty-nine or something like that, over
                    the separatists. The separatists still got 40% of the vote, which is the exact
                    percentage that they got in 1980 on their referendum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>ROBINSON: So it is always there. And I think that the rest of Canada, Anglophone
                    Canada, really must be attuned to this. I don't think separatism will ever
                    occur. Although not a Canadian, I have strong pro-Canadian views. To me, it is
                    treason. I mean, if the governor of Illinois was saying the things the Levesque
                    said, we would hang him. And then we would try him later, I suppose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean you don't have due process in Illinois?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: No, not for treason. But, you know, the French Canadians—you know this
                    firsthand better than I do—but the sign of the revolution in the '60s and early
                    '70s really freed the French Canadians from the Roman Catholic Church to the
                    point now really where they have almost gone too far, where they don't pay any
                    attention to the teachings of the church. But what they did was they came in the
                    marketplace, and today French Canadians are far more entrepreneurial than your
                    average Anglo-Canadian in Ontario. They are sitting back waiting for the
                    government to do things. And the French Canadians are the ones, in many cases, I
                    would rather do business with because they are—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They are out and at it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: They are out and at it, that's right. And I tell you they
                    have—bilingualism, of course, is absurd, as far as the United States is
                    concerned. But with two founding societies, even though it is a terrible problem
                    involved with it—in many cases, a needless duplication—it is, nonetheless,
                    working. I think in the long run, it will do a lot to mitigate any separatist
                    feelings. That, with their entrepreneurial spirit, I think, will eventually kill
                    the concept of separatism.</p>
                <p>And French Canadians are now regarded—I mean, in the privacy of our drawing rooms
                    or living rooms—as, you know, as being first, Canadians; second, North
                    Americans; and only third, French. Because they don't like the French any more
                    than the French like them. And the only time they say they are French is when
                    some Anglophobe gets on them for being French. Then they really become French.
                    Otherwise, they are as good a Canadian as anybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I couldn't agree more. I was horrified when I went to
                        Canada in 1958. I was horrified by the anti-French tone of most Anglophobes
                        over there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: I know it. There were second-class citizens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was very, very repulsive.</hi>

                <p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, in the Reno Club, there were no French
                        Canadians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: No, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I used to take French Canadians for lunch now and then
                        just for the hell of it, you know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, incidentally, I am trying to get the Reno Club and
                        the Cosmos Club to have correspondence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: That would be good. I remember the Reno Club.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I used to be a member.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Well, I can help on that side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they want it. Ambassador Robinson and I will talk
                        about it then. They want it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Well, let's see. Is there any other subject?</p>
                <p>ROBINSON: I was just thinking. You know, Bill, there have been more ambassadors
                    shot since the Second World War than generals. Now I don't know whether it's
                    killed—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Four of them were friends—five of them were friends of
                        mine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Really?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes. I don't whether it is accurate to say shot or killed. But, in any
                    event, shot would be correct. I am probably the last ambassador to walk around
                    freely in Canada. I had, as you know, my driver, and we had an armored car and
                    all of that. Against regulation, I carried a—in the back seat in the briefcase,
                    there was always a snub-nose thirty-eight. The problem was never Canadians, but
                    these terrorists—Iranians. Armenians were our biggest threat because they wanted
                    to get back to us for trying and jailing an Armenian in Los Angeles for shooting
                    a Turk.</p>
                <p>One of the funny things was we had an informer in Nicaragua who had prior been a
                    Marine or something in one of our excursions down there. He found out that the
                    Tupamaro European communists were meeting at some point in the United States to
                    engineer the kidnapping of the U.S. ambassador to Canada. So I was alerted to
                    all this. And there was a two-week period—John Rousebeck my DCM, said, “Boy, if
                    they do get you, they are in for something.” But anyway . . . [Laughter]</p>
                <p>It didn't work. I was almost, you know, disappointed, because when you are on a
                    two-week alert, and they are looking at everything real carefully and there
                    doesn't come, it is somewhat of a letdown.</p>
                <p>One time I was walking in Ottawa. I came out of a government building, and a
                    young man came up to me quite rapidly. And I thought, “Oh, my God.” Well, I
                    noticed he had a clean tee shirt on. It is funny how much you remember. It
                    wasn't a dirty tee shirt, so I thought maybe he might be one of us, rather than
                    an attempted assassin. And he said, “Ambassador Robinson,” like that.</p>
                <p>And I said, “Yes,” looking and watching his hands.</p>
                <p>He stuck out his hand and said, “God bless America.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>And I had other people come up to me on the street and say, “God bless you, Mr.
                    Ambassador. What you are doing for our country is . . .” That, as opposed to
                    what some of the people were saying initially in the press. That we were telling
                    them what to do. Reagan was a bomb-slinging cowboy, and I was his clone, and all
                    of this. Given time, we can all rise above that and get the point over. But we
                    have to be consistent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have to remember also that the Canadians, in the end,
                        do believe in fair play. Their standards are all right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Even more than we do.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even more so, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: At the retroactive backing provision of the National Energy Program, I
                    said, “I send my people, and I've got one ace card.” Because, of course, I ruled
                    out any reciprocity. I said, “And that ace card is Canadian sense of fair play,
                    and I will play that card.” And I did play that card. And believe me, it worked
                    wonders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I think perhaps it is worth recording that one of the
                        best advice I got when I went to Canada was by somebody who had been in the
                        Canadian desk a long time. And he said, “You know, you can kick them in the
                        shins, you can argue with them, you can fight with them, that's all okay.”
                        He said, “One thing, never dent their halos.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Oh, that's right. You don't want to dent their halos. That's right.
                    They are holier than thou.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The moral sense is very strong there, and it goes back a
                        long ways. No, I am familiar with the way the media treated you, and the
                        fact that by the time you left, you were fully respected across the board,
                        not only by the media, but everybody else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: I appreciate that, Bill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have been told this by a great many Canadians with whom
                        I maintain contact.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: In dealing with them, Bill, just to finish on that point, I think the
                    open, direct approach is the best with the Canadians. I never went in with a
                    false position, which I was prepared to negotiate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No hidden balls.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: No hidden balls. I mean, I just told them what I thought. And we sat
                    down, and we tried to work it out, and we were always able to do it. But I
                    didn't have any cushions. I suppose I always have a fallback position. By
                    playing that ace card, you know, they didn't have to agree with me. But at least
                    they understood I was telling it like I saw it, and it really worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always thought that, you know, you might as well be
                        straightforward with them. You know, in the end, you get down to what are
                        the issues, anyhow. Because they are very able people. They would analyze
                        problems very successfully. They were good negotiators.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>ROBINSON: They were great in both world wars. My ship was with units of the Royal
                    Canadian Navy, destroyer units, Tribal-class. They were damn good at Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, their military, their professional military are
                        first-class. They don't have any tools to do anything with, but—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: No. But you know, one time Trudeau, Shultz, and I were at lunch at
                    External Affairs, and Trudeau looked at Shultz, and then he looked at me, and he
                    says, “I don't think I've got enough money for Paul's ships.” That was the first
                    batch of patrol frigates, which, of course were authorized and now are building.
                    And now there is a second batch, six each.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They are building them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: They are building them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What they had was far more.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: They had twenty destroyers, sixteen of which were beyond, were
                    superannuated. Not really a naval term, they were beyond—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Beyond recovery.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: The other four of the new Tribal-class were mid-life. They are now
                    fifteen, sixteen years old. Normally, the life is twenty, twenty-two years as a
                    destroyer. So, of course, if they get rid of the sixteen and replace it by
                    twelve, they are still not where they were ten years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. In quality, they are improved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because the newer stuff will have more technology.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>ROBINSON: I played a role. The British Founder-class would have been selected had
                    they not pulled our appropriation rug from under their submarine program. But
                    what they need are surface capacity. They need destroyer types, frigates. They
                    didn't need subs, but the reason they wanted subs was because they wanted to
                    patrol under the icecap to assure their sovereignty.</p>
                <p>By the way, I don't think anybody can argue that those waters and lands in the
                    north are Canadian. And, finally, we got off our high horse on the
                    rule-of-the-seas business and said that you can't walk across the Gulf of Sidra,
                    you know, in Libya, but you can walk across the Bering Straights in Canadian
                    frozen territories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think rationality has overcome the wall in our
                        view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes, I think so. That's right. That's the sole issue that I agreed with
                    the Canadians on where we were—but, of course, I couldn't quite say it publicly.
                    What I did was merely point out the two sides, and let it go. That came at the
                    very end of my tenure in Canada. I pooh-poohed a lot of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was kicked off the by the polar sea—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That went through the last summer you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: It did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: We knew about it, and the Canadians knew about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we had negotiated the whole thing—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: I know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Through External.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>ROBINSON: Sure. But, you see, the press got hold of it. I played it down as if it
                    wasn't anything. In fact, it really wasn't anything, except here again we get
                    the perception, and the perception was something that we Americans don't respect
                    our territory. And, of course, I did. And as it turned out, we agreed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now we have negotiated a modus vivendi on
                        icebreakers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That will take care of all these problems in the future,
                        it seems to me.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: It will.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was a great uproar. A lot of people got very
                        excited about it in Canada. And nobody ever heard of it down here, you know.
                        We got one line in the Washington Post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROBINSON: Well, it really didn't get that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, I think we have boxed the compass pretty well.
