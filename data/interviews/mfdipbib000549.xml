                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 8, 1991</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 8, 1991 and this is an interview with
                        Edward C. Ingraham on his career on behalf of The Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I wonder if you could give me a little about your background— where you came
                    from, your education, etc.?</p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: I was born in Mineola, New York, out on Long Island. I have never been
                    to Mineola since, as far as I know. I grew up half in upstate New York in a
                    small town and half in southern California. One grandparent group was upstate
                    New York my home. Went to Dartmouth from New York, class of 1943. We all
                    graduated early, just in time to get into the Army in World War II, European
                    theater. I was a weather observer...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you serve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: England, France, Belgium and Germany.</p>
                <p>...reading thermometers and trying to tell the Air Force when they could fly.
                    While I was in the Army I saw an article in the Stars and Stripes about the
                    Foreign Service examination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Stars and Stripes being the military newspaper.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes. I thought, “Ah ha, here is a chance to get out of the Army quick.”
                    This was right after the end of the war. So I signed up to take the exam. About
                    two days later we were told that we were going home, so I didn't take it, but it
                    was in my mind.</p>
                <p>I got to New York, went down to the city and got a job. I saw another article in
                    the paper about Foreign Service exam, and took it late in 1946 and came into the
                    Service in 1947.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from Dartmouth before you went into the
                        Army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes. They speeded us up, getting us through in three and a half years
                    rather than four.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went into the Foreign Service in 1947. Was there a
                        training course that brought young officers together at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes, there was. It was about a three-month course that was supposed to
                    teach you everything—consular, administrative, political, economic, where the
                    world is going, what an allowance is, how you make out an expense account, etc.
                    I took the course in the summer and early fall of 1947. Living in New York, I
                    had just gotten married. I would go down to Washington every Sunday night on the
                    train (round trip was $15 in those days) and then every Friday night I would
                    ride back up to New York. This went on for three to four months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you characterize your class—where did you come from,
                        how did you see the world and the United States' role in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: It was a varied class; we came from everywhere. The only thing we all
                    had in common was that we had all been in World War II. So we all had something
                    to talk about and relate to. Of the ones I knew best who came in with me, one
                    was a Marine lieutenant in the Pacific, another had been flying in the Air
                    Force, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember when I came in I discovered in my basic officer
                        course one of the young men had been an officer in my outfit in Japan and
                        had been on my promotion panel getting me up to airman first class.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>How did you see America's role in the world in 1947?</p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: I think we saw it quite righteously. We were beginning to get a little
                    more sophisticated, but it seemed to me that in my class we were convinced we
                    were the good guys. We had won the war, it is too bad about the Russians, we
                    thought everything was going to be fine, we thought the little triumvirate or
                    the big triumvirate of Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, or Truman, Churchill,
                    Stalin, or Truman, Attlee, Stalin was going to run the world. All of the sudden
                    the Russians turned out to be the bad guys. I think we had a rather simplistic
                    view of the world at that time. Not inaccurate, just simplistic and naive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you consider yourself going out to do a job or as
                        missionaries?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>INGRAHAM: A little bit of both, I think. First of all it was a job which sounded
                    more interesting than the one I had had on Wall Street for less than a year. Of
                    course, if I had stayed on Wall Street for 20-30 years I might have ended up
                    with $20 million, but at the end of 35 years I would probably have gone to jail
                    like the rest. Coming out of the Army you are used to moving around and you know
                    there are horizons over there and want to see what they are. It sounded like an
                    ideal job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first post was Bolivia and you were there for about
                        two and a half years. Where did you go and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: I was sent down to Cochabamba, Bolivia. This was my first post and it
                    was a one-man consulate. It wasn't as ridiculous as it may seem because there
                    wasn't much going on in Cochabamba and there wasn't much reason to have a
                    consulate there. We opened the consulate in the latter days of World War II to
                    keep an eye on what the Neo-Nazis were doing in Bolivia and also to support
                    rubber-collecting operations in the lowlands of eastern Bolivia.</p>
                <p>It was a delightful city then. I visited the place again in 1986 and it has
                    quintupled in size and lost all its charm. It is a very sad city now.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I had been down there about a year when somebody in Washington asked why
                    we had a post there. The question was sent down to me and I couldn't answer it.
                    The Embassy in La Paz couldn't say why we had a post in Cochabamba either, so
                    the Department closed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then went to our Embassy in La Paz. What was the
                        political situation like in Bolivia when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: I learned my first lesson about the real world and...actually in
                    retrospect after I left Bolivia, I realized that we had been in a sort of dream
                    world. By “we” I mean the American Embassy in La Paz. I was a political officer.
                    It was rather an informal arrangement. The Ambassador, a fine old man, Joe
                    Flack, was an old European hand (his wife was Viennese) and to him it was like
                    being sent out to be Ambassador to Afghanistan or some such place.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>After the overthrow of Villaroel in 1946, there was in Bolivia what you could
                    call a democracy. There were free elections and presidents who were elected. We
                    thought we were watching democracy in action. What we were watching and none of
                    us realized it... I don't blame myself for this, but the older ones there, the
                    DCM, etc., who were either South America or Europe oriented...but only after I
                    left Bolivia did I realize we had been looking at a world that wasn't quite the
                    real world. After an election, for example, I sent in a despatch giving the
                    election returns and our commentary, which was rather elegant but an Alice in
                    Wonderland commentary because only about one of ten Bolivians voted. The voters
                    were white with Spanish background. The ones who didn't vote were the Indians
                    who made up the majority of the country. They had no part in the life of the
                    country; they were exploited.</p>
                <p>A few years later, I think about 1952, there was a big explosion. We had a
                    military mission in Cochabamba to train the Bolivian Army—that was the main
                    reason for keeping a consulate in Cochabamba after World War II. There were five
                    or six rather pleasant American Army officers there, trying to teach the
                    Bolivian Army how to fight, carry guns and march. That army was wiped out
                    totally in 1952.</p>
                <p>It was only after I left Bolivia that I realized we really hadn't been in the
                    real world. We weren't reporting on Bolivia, the real society of the nation. We
                    were reporting about this little upper crust of people who ran the country. It
                    wasn't a dictatorship. It was relatively benign, but it wasn't the real
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't of the tin miners, unions, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: They were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they weren't making themselves felt at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Oh yes they were. They were making themselves felt to the elite, who
                    saw them as animals down below, growling. There was a certain amount of
                    uneasiness.</p>
                <p>A number of Americans worked in the tin mines. I can remember an outburst in one
                    of the mines, Catavi, when several Americans were grabbed by the miners, sticks
                    of dynamite placed on their chests and then blown up. We managed to get the
                    survivors and their families out by plane. Our air attach flew down and managed
                    to snag them out as the miners chased them across the field. It was rather
                    dramatic. We had one rescued wife and a couple of children stay with us.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>But none of us at the Embassy seemed to realize what it really meant: that here
                    was a country seething. Instead, we were following the intricate interplay of
                    politics among the little group at the top.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, I suppose, was almost endemic to diplomats within
                        much of Latin America at the time, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: I guess it was. I was trying to recall whether any of us knew better. I
                    can't think of anyone. The only one who might have known better was another
                    junior officer who married a Bolivian girl—fellow named Sam Eaton who ended up
                    as Ambassador to Colombia. I think he was beginning to realize what was really
                    going on in Bolivia. Basically the rest of us didn't. Of course, Bolivia was not
                    the country that attracted the best and brightest among the senior officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose about that time our major concern was Argentina,
                        with Peron and the aftermath?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes, it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving on, you were transferred to Hong Kong in 1950.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes, 1950 to Hong Kong. In those days—I wonder if you can still do
                    it?—you were able to specify three choices for your next post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We used to call it our April Fools report.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Well, everybody would normally put down London, Paris and Rome. To get
                    your choice you would have to put down posts no one else would list. After
                    seeing Bolivia, I had had enough of South America so I thought, “Where can one
                    go?” and put down Sri Lanka, Hong Kong and one other far-off post. Lo and behold
                    they sent me to Hong Kong. When we got off the plane in Hong Kong, within ten
                    minutes I was saying, “Well, this is certainly better than South America.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Hong Kong?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>INGRAHAM: That was a weird one. This was 1950 and the Korean War had just broken
                    out. The Chinese Communists had taken over the Mainland and the children of
                    Chinese-Americans and thousands and thousands of Chinese who had bought slots as
                    the false children of Chinese-Americans were trying to get to the United States.
                    First we had one consular officer, then we had two (this is before I got there),
                    then we had ten, then twenty, and by the time I got there we had about fifty
                    trying to process the citizenship claims of Chinese.</p>
                <p>I soon found that ever since the various oriental exclusion acts of the 19th
                    century and early 20th, the Chinese had built up a system to get around these
                    blatantly racist laws and we consular officers were there to stop them. And we
                    did our best to carry out the law, although we all had a certain sympathy for
                    the Chinese, thinking first of all that the law was wrong and secondly these
                    people would make damn good citizens if they did get to the States.</p>
                <p>We were assigned to spend entire days interviewing Chinese who claimed American
                    citizenship. Our job was to try to trip them up and prove that their claim was
                    false. Now they knew the claim was false, we knew that they knew the claim was
                    false, and they knew that we knew the claim was false. So it was the sort of
                    game that went on and on and on. Sometimes you won and sometimes they won. I did
                    this for a year and a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I dealt with something similar in the Refugee Relief
                        Program in Germany. When you get into these massive programs there is a
                        little disrespect for the law. You are doing it but you don't take it too
                        seriously.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Exactly that. You have the feeling that, “Okay, a lot of them are
                    getting through, and I have a case here that I can fight to the hilt or just say
                    'Oh, what the hell.' So he gets to the States. It is not going to hurt the
                    country. I am not breaking the law, I am just giving up a little early.”</p>
                <p>My job was to interview 16-year-olds. The law at the time said that the
                    foreign-born children of an American parent had to live in the States for five
                    years before they became 21, so they would have to get to the U.S. by the time
                    they were 16. They were all male. We would get an affidavit from the alleged
                    father in the States saying, “I left San Francisco on such and such a date, I
                    arrived—there is a little area in China near Canton, Toishan district, where
                    they virtually all came from—at my home village on such and such date. Nine
                    months later my wife gave birth to twin boys. Nine months after that she again
                    gave birth to twin boys. I left the following morning and she was pregnant
                    again.” So 16 years later, the oldest of 6 male children would come into the
                    consulate and say, “I am so-and-so, the son of so-and-so. Here is my affidavit,
                    please give me a passport.”</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>It was a racket, of course. We all knew it, but as I said, we had sympathy for
                    the victim. Our job was to prove that, say, two little boys who presented
                    affidavit claiming they were brothers had never actually seen each other until
                    they met on the ferry to Hong Kong from Canton. We would ask them questions.
                    “You lived in this village? Was your house the 4th or 5th one from the road? Was
                    it made of brick or mud? Where was the village well?” We would ask one of the
                    boys these questions and then lock him up in the closet and ask the other the
                    same series of questions. I did that for a year and a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course they had a book which they were studying
                        beforehand about the lay-out of the village, so it was really a matter of
                        how good there memory was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes. And the lay-out of the village was also in the files of the
                    Immigration and Nationalization Service in Hawaii, because their false father
                    had gone through the same process when he came to the States, 30, 40 years
                    ago.</p>
                <p>While all that was going on—while we were interviewing 16- year-old kids—the
                    Korean War was happening all around us. So Hong Kong was an utterly fascinating
                    place to be. But there was one unhappy development though...we arrived there in
                    the late summer of 1950 and early in 1951 all the Consulate General wives and
                    children were evacuated. This followed the Chinese entry into the Korean War in
                    November, 1950. There was no certainty the Chinese wouldn't keep on marching
                    down to the end of the Korean peninsula and possibly move into Hong Kong. So our
                    Consul General, Walter McConaughy, decided to evacuate wives and children. So my
                    wife and, at that time, one child, went back to the States and spent a year
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From that assignment you were assigned again to a one-man
                        post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes, to Perth, Western Australia. Somehow Perth came open and I guess
                    because I had been at a one-man post before, I was direct transferred there. So
                    one day in the fall of 1951, I flew directly from Hong Kong to Perth. In those
                    days a flight from Hong Kong to Perth was not simply boarding a 747 in Hong Kong
                    and getting off in Perth. I had to fly to Saigon; to Singapore; to Jakarta,
                    where there was lots of arguing trying to get on another plane; to Darwin, where
                    I had to hang around several days; and finally on a DC-3 with a few other
                    passengers and a lot of mining equipment, to Perth. We spent not quite three
                    years there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had Perth been open before you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>INGRAHAM: It was opened, I believe, a little before the War. It was more of a
                    purposeful post than Cochabamba, Bolivia, because every passenger ship that came
                    to Australia from Europe would land there first. Perth was a delight. We have
                    been back in Perth...visited it in 1988, and it has turned into one of the most
                    lovely, glowing cities you could find anywhere. After Hong Kong it was at first
                    a bit slow. Hong Kong was glamour, excitement, etc. But Perth turned out to be
                    an utter delight from beginning to end. We were very busy. We had a little bit
                    of everything: even a USIS office that consisted of one Australian girl. I had
                    to give talks, officiate at flower shows. I was also assiduously reporting on
                    the politics of Western Australia, which was fun but not of any great
                    consequence.</p>
                <p>One odd sidelight: since we had come from Hong Kong, some of the Asian students
                    who were at the university in Western Australia got in touch with us. We got to
                    know some of them quite well. One, as a matter of fact, still is a very close
                    friend of ours, living here in Washington. There was also a young Australian
                    student at the university who...at that time most Australians were not
                    interested in Asia, to them home was Europe, the world consisted of Europe and
                    America. Incidentally they particularly loved Americans in Perth because in 1942
                    Perth had been totally deserted by the Australian Armed Forces. The Australians
                    felt when the Japanese invaded they could hold Melbourne and Sydney and an arc
                    in between, but Perth would have to be given up. Early 1942, the people in Perth
                    told us, they looked out to sea and saw some large ships coming in from a
                    distance. It wasn't until they got close that the people in Perth discovered
                    they were American and not Japanese ships. So the Perth people couldn't have
                    been nicer to Americans, which is true to this day almost anywhere in
                    Australia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it you were pretty much at the end of the leash as
                        far as the Embassy was concerned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: The farthest post from Washington in the world. I wrote an article in
                    the Foreign Service Journal on this. And the farthest from its supervisory post
                    of any in the world. So I was very much on my own. Although we were in touch by
                    telephone, etc.</p>
                <p>I wanted to mention the one young Australian student who used to join the Asian
                    students when they visited. We had them over to the house quite often, because
                    they were a bit lonely and the Australians didn't quite know what to do with
                    Asians. This young man was interested in Asia and in them. His name was Hawke.
                    He was the nephew of the then Chief Minister of Western Australia. Today he is
                    the Prime Minister of Australia. I hadn't realized for years that he was the
                    same guy until our Washington-based Asian friend said, “Remember good ol' Bob
                    Hawke?” I said, “My God is that the same Hawke?” And he said, “Of course it is.”
                    Perth was nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Perth, you still did not go back to Washington for an
                        assignment. You were still within the Asian area weren't you?</hi>

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>INGRAHAM: I went to Madras. Why Madras? Well, we saw a movie when we were in
                    Perth, John Renoir's The River. It actually was about Bengal and it gave us
                    thoughts about exotic India, where we had never been. So I asked for India. In
                    those days if you asked for India you got it. We requested Bombay and ended up
                    in Madras. There again an utterly delightful experience. Madras was a consulate
                    general. We had a Consul General. I was the number two, substantially farther
                    down. We had 3 or 4 other officers and a separate USIS post.</p>
                <p>Our mission was to follow what was going on in south India, which, as we kept
                    emphasizing, was a totally different world from the north. There was always a
                    certain amount of built-in tension between Madras and New Delhi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They looked down upon you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Well, our Consul General kept trying to make the point that south India
                    was different. The southerners speak different languages, are from a different
                    ethnic group, from a different culture. They see themselves as Indians but also
                    as Dravidians. They look upon northerners as fellow Indians, yes, but also as
                    foreigners. There was a good deal of ethnic pride in south India at that time.
                    If you spoke Hindi in the street, they would glower at you and small boys might
                    even throw stones. We had a Hindi-speaking officer who was assigned to Madras so
                    he could practice his Hindi. It didn't work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Consul General?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Hank Ramsey. He died in California two or three years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he run the post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: I think very well indeed. He gave us our heads. He was the boss, no
                    question about it. He would say, “You do this and you do that.” He would keep us
                    all moving. He would also clue us in on whatever was going on, too. We would
                    meet daily to discuss what was going on. He was a good man. We were following
                    the very lively politics of south India. This was just before the big
                    realignment of the Indian states along linguistic lines that took place in 1956.
                    Much of the agitation and the political activity in south India was aimed at
                    influencing or pushing for linguistic states. All the Tamils would be in one
                    state, the Malayalam speakers in another, etc. Up to that time it had been
                    divided along the old British lines.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>It was a revelation of sorts to me because, having been in another developing
                    country, Bolivia, it seemed to me that for the first time I was in a place where
                    we were really in touch with the local political life. For the first time we
                    were reporting what was actually happening rather than just reporting on the
                    little European sliver at the top.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you say was the predominant attitude of the
                        Americans towards the Indians and the Indians towards the Americans in your
                        area? We had gone through a rough patch where the Indians had not been very
                        helpful—the Korean business. Was Karela in your district?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes it was. Karela was the first communist governed state...as far as I
                    know the first state in the world where the communists had been voted in in a
                    free election. Bengal might have been but I think Karela was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe San Marino.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: San Marino may have been, but Karela was a substantial state with maybe
                    10 million people. The best educated people in all of India. And the highest
                    number of Christians, most of whom voted communist.</p>
                <p>I think we at the Consulate General were far more sympathetic toward the Indians
                    because we were there. This was the time of Foster Dulles, who felt neutrality
                    was immoral and that if you weren't with us you must be at least partly against
                    us. We had to operate within those strictures. But at the same time, I think,
                    all of us were, at least in Madras, far more sympathetic to the Indian side. At
                    the same time, we would argue with them. I remember giving speeches here and
                    there pointing out the dastardly deeds of the Russians and getting very tough
                    questions from the Indian audience.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, English was the language of communication in south India. Almost
                    all the Indians right down to the village level knew at least a few words of
                    English. So our lack of knowledge of Tamil or Malayalam didn't cut us off from
                    people. It was a fascinating period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you under any pressure to do anything about the
                        communist state there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>INGRAHAM: In a way we were. We were to keep a very close eye on Karela and report
                    what was going on, particularly anything that could be used to show what swine
                    they were. Fortunately, it was a very well run state before the communists took
                    over and they didn't ruin it. They actually ran a pretty good government. Yes,
                    they were communists, but I can remember taking a trip through Karela in 1955 or
                    maybe early '56 and being fascinated not only by the problems of the state
                    (which was grossly overpopulated) but by how well they were coping with the mess
                    and—I suppose Bolivia was in the back of my mind—how the poverty seemed to be
                    reasonably well shared. More so than in, lets say, Madras or other parts of
                    south India. Although even in Madras, where poverty was extreme in some places,
                    you didn't have the feeling of a little class at the top running everything and
                    exploiting the people on the bottom- -everybody was poor.</p>
                <p>From then on I knew that this was the part of the world that most fascinated me
                    and I had no intentions of leaving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Madras in 1956. Then you went where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: I decided I wanted to be a political officer. In Madras I was a
                    jack-of-all-trades. We had a political officer, the one who spoke Hindi, and an
                    economic officer. I did some of the political reporting and also rode herd on
                    the consulate. I was the consular officer, but we had a couple of...this is
                    something common to many South and Southeast Asian posts... Indian employees who
                    had been with the consulate for many years. One of them knew far more about
                    visas than I did and probably as much as the Assistant Secretary who ran
                    consular affairs back in Washington. They had worked for the consulate forever,
                    their loyalty to us was total. They considered themselves part of the family.
                    When we had in-house parties we would include them. They ran the consular
                    section. At first I remember saying, “I had better check out everything very
                    carefully,” having come from Hong Kong (where shortly after I left a number of
                    Americans in the immense consular section had been transferred—one direct from
                    Hong Kong to Atlanta Federal Penitentiary). So I watched the consular work
                    closely in Madras. Everything proved to be absolutely impeccable, so from then
                    on I relaxed and let them get on with it. I would do some political reporting,
                    this and that. At the end of the day I would sign 15, 20 or 30 consular
                    documents absolutely secure in the knowledge that they were properly prepared.
                    That was another virtue of life in Madras.</p>

                <p>INGRAHAM: I decided I wanted to be a political officer and the avenue to that was
                    language-area training. So I applied for Indonesian language training, was
                    accepted and brought back to the States. I spent about six months in Washington
                    on Indonesian language training and was then sent off in September for an
                    academic year at Cornell for more language training and Southeast Asian area
                    courses. Cornell was one of the centers of Southeast Asian, particularly
                    Indonesian, area studies at that time. In the summer of 1958 I left for Jakarta
                    as a political officer.</p>
                <p>This was my first time, except for that period in La Paz, in an embassy. This was
                    at a time when...we tend to forget Indonesia has disappeared from everyone's
                    attention, you rarely see any mention of Indonesia in the newspapers. These days
                    we tend to forget that around 1958 or '60, if you polled the State Department on
                    which country was the greatest menace in Southeast Asia some would say Vietnam,
                    but many would say Indonesia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes. Here again, this was the period when everything was black or white
                    as far as we were concerned, until 1960 anyway. We were still trying to work
                    with Sukarno. One of the people I admired most in the Foreign Service was Howard
                    Jones, our Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to talk to you about that. So you got out to

                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Jakarta and Medan. In the spring of '59 our consul in Medan, in
                    Sumatra, was bitten by a mad dog, became quite sick, was rushed off to Singapore
                    and had to be transferred out. He would have been transferred in a few months
                    anyway and his replacement was in the process but wouldn't be arriving for a few
                    months. So they sent me there for five months, with my family, to take over the
                    consulate in Medan. So I was in Jakarta for about eight months; in Medan for
                    about five months; then back to Jakarta for the rest of the tour. It was very
                    useful because I came back to Jakarta as the most knowledgeable officer on
                    things Sumatran. And it was at this time, of course, that there was a rather
                    major regional rebellion against the Sukarno government, promoted and supported
                    by the United States. The basic document was declassified in the 1970's so I can
                    talk about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you and the Embassy when you first arrived see the
                        internal situation and Sukarno?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>INGRAHAM: When I got there, the 1958 rebellion had just been put down by the army
                    under General Nasution, who is still alive. The Indonesian army had shown far
                    more ability than we anticipated, and the officers had shown far more political
                    savvy. At the time we were beginning to see that the eventual struggle within
                    the country would not be between left and right as such but between Sukarno and
                    the army. Actually it was between the communists and the army, with Sukarno
                    increasingly on the communist side. We began to understand this just about the
                    time I arrived.</p>
                <p>Indonesia had a parliamentary system in 1958. Piece by piece Sukarno dismantled
                    it and put himself in a position of ever greater personal authority. He was a
                    lousy administrator, but to the average Indonesian in the street he was the
                    embodiment of Indonesian nationalism. He was a magnificent speaker. Here was a
                    person with a very healthy ego, a great deal of talent, a strange grab-bag mind
                    full of all sorts of bits and pieces. Sukarno was no more of a communist than I
                    was because he couldn't accept any authority higher than himself. Here was a
                    case where you could actually watch power corrupting. I don't mean in a monetary
                    sense, but in the power sense. Sukarno would get more power and then go on to
                    seize more and more. He began to see himself as the embodiment of Indonesia. He
                    had enough ability to carry the Indonesian people along with him.</p>
                <p>Then things started to go to hell. There was a show-down with the Dutch. The
                    Indonesians nationalized Dutch industries, those that were pouring money into
                    the country, and they soon collapsed. Economic conditions got worse and worse.
                    More circuses, parades and speeches by Sukarno, less money and more hungry
                    people. Meanwhile the army was coalescing and moving away from Sukarno.</p>
                <p>Now through all this, Jones had established a unique personal relationship with
                    Sukarno. Jones has been widely criticized for being taken to the cleaners by
                    Sukarno, but that is nonsense. He knew exactly what Sukarno was doing. He would
                    explain to me, “Ed, we have got to hang on here. Sukarno is moving away from us.
                    He has given us (let's say it was 1960, getting pretty late in the game) due
                    cause to break relations but we will be the losers if we leave Indonesia to the
                    other side. If we have to undergo humiliations here, we are a big country and
                    can stand it. Live through it if we must, but stay on because something is going
                    to happen.” “Well, Mr. Ambassador, like what?” “Ed, I don't know. But something
                    is going to happen and we have to be here when it does. And perhaps to try to
                    help it happen.” This was his whole approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were partisans on both sides. That Sukarno would be
                        making a speech condemning the United States and Jones would just sit there
                        rather than walk out. How about you and other officers in the Embassy? How
                        did you feel about this? What was the atmosphere, particularly in the
                        political section?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>INGRAHAM: It was a bit mixed, but basically I think we understood what Jones
                    wanted and what he meant. Basically we were on his side, I think. There was some
                    criticism. A number of us felt on a few occasions he might have gone too far.
                    Sukarno would get up and dance an Indonesian folk dance and Jones would be right
                    up there with him. Jones was the last Westerner who had entre to Sukarno.
                    Sukarno would make an anti-American speech and Jones would just sit there. But
                    later on Jones would go see Sukarno and say, “Damn it...” I accompanied him on
                    one or two of those calls. Jones would speak frankly to Sukarno. He was such a
                    sunny, pleasant guy that he could say some pretty nasty things but say them in a
                    way that Sukarno would take. Sukarno, at least at that stage, wasn't beyond
                    reach. He was a warm person himself and he responded to Jones' personal
                    approach. I think if you dug down deep enough in his psyche, Sukarno was a
                    colonial subject who wanted to show the world that he was as good as the white
                    men who had run Indonesia for 300 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there instructions from the Desk to the Embassy
                        saying to get a little tougher or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes there were. Washington was inclined to want to push Sukarno harder.
                    It was a difference of degree. The people on the Desk in Washington at that time
                    knew Indonesia. Frank Underhill in particular, an old Indonesian hand. Others on
                    the Desk also knew the area reasonably well and understood what was going on.
                    One of the problems, as I later found in Washington, was trying to sell it to
                    the 7th floor of the State Department.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I think Jones did keep us in there long enough so that when the
                    inevitable—which he knew was going to happen—did happen, we were still
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in '63?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: '65. It was funny. Jones left about six months before the 1965
                    explosion. He had really worn himself out. But he kept us in there for a long
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While we were trying to keep a foot in the door how did
                        you see the role of CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>INGRAHAM: They were there. They were all over the place. But the operation that
                    they were so happy about, the '58 rebellion, had simply fallen apart. While we
                    were in Medan those five months there was a lovely resort up at Lake Toba but we
                    couldn't use it because it was still in rebel hands. I can remember driving down
                    to the Goodyear rubber estate at Wingfoot, about a hundred miles south of Medan.
                    There was an area through which you drove as fast as you could, because it was
                    rebel-held. When you visited the big rubber estates, you would find the foreign
                    staff all hunkered down in a series of isolated strong points with the police
                    all around them. They were under siege by the rebel forces that had lost the
                    rebellion but were still fighting a guerrilla war against Jakarta, trying to cut
                    off its sources of foreign exchange by destroying the rubber estates. I would
                    drive down to visit the estates and talk to the British and Americans there. At
                    Goodyear, for example, they would tell me, “Well, damn it, the rebels did such
                    and such and chopped down 600 of our trees. Just two weeks ago they shot up one
                    of the collection stations.” And so on. It was a nuisance warfare because the
                    rebels had been beaten. They had started out big by taking over the oil
                    facilities in Palembang but the army under Nasution mounted an operation that
                    drove them out into the jungle and broke the back of the rebellion in Sumatra.
                    The rebels fought on longer in Sulawesi but in a month or so they were defeated
                    there too.</p>
                <p>Then of course there was that last incident in the 1958 rebellion, that happened
                    just before I got there. The rebels had an air force of about a half dozen
                    U.S.-supplied B26s which operated over eastern Indonesia. One day in May 1958
                    they dropped a few bombs over Ambon. One bomb killed a fair number of people.
                    Somebody managed to fire an anti-aircraft gun and hit the B26 and out came two
                    parachutes. One of them was an Indonesian and the other was a man named Allen
                    Pope. In his pocket was a membership card to the officer's club at the American
                    air base at Clark Field. Pope was in jail the whole time I was in Indonesia. His
                    trial took place in Jakarta, broadcast to the whole population. Pope was found
                    guilty, sentenced to death and held in a prison in the Jakarta suburbs. His main
                    complaint while he was there was that he didn't get enough exercise. We junior
                    embassy officers would bring mail to him. Pope maintained from the very
                    beginning, “Well, yes I was in the American air force and used to fly for Air
                    America in Vietnam but I decided on my own that I would leave the air force
                    because I wanted to join the Indonesian rebels in fighting the communists.” He
                    stuck to that story. The Indonesians knew he wasn't telling the truth. And he
                    knew that they knew. But he stuck to the story. After they sentenced him to
                    death, he was kept in a small cottage inside the prison walls. I remember that I
                    once had to carry some weights over to him because he wasn't getting enough
                    exercise. He was an impressive guy. He was not a brilliant man of the world, but
                    he stuck to his cover story to the end.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Eventually we all realized that the Indonesians were not going to execute him
                    even though he was under a death sentence. Our problem then was to get him
                    freed. After I left Indonesia, Bobby Kennedy came out to Indonesia. This was
                    when the Kennedy Administration was making an all-out effort to reverse the
                    trend and try to win back Sukarno. Bobby asked Sukarno what could be done about
                    Pope. “Isn't there some way?” Sukarno said he would take care of it. A few
                    months later there was a brief item in the local newspapers—”The following
                    former rebels have been released:” There followed a long list of Indonesian
                    names. Nestled in the middle of them was “Allen Pope”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though we were on opposite sides, it sounds as if the

                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes, however bad the relations between our countries were and however
                    much we disliked what they were doing, they were accessible. Jones could see
                    Sukarno. He could just walk in. Jones' most regular contact was Subandrio. He
                    was one of the most utterly amoral and brilliant men I have ever come across. He
                    was the Foreign Minister and deputy Prime Minister. Machiavelli was a child
                    compared to Subandrio. But he was always accessible. Not to me, but to Jones and
                    his DCM.</p>
                <p>I could call up the people in the Foreign Ministry—it would take about six hours
                    to make a phone call because the phones didn't work, but once I got someone they
                    would say, “Sure come on over.” They were accessible.</p>
                <p>And traveling around the countryside, yes, we did a lot of traveling. You would
                    go to a town, say, in central Java where there were a lot of communists moving
                    out into the countryside. You would go to a village and you could talk to the
                    villagers. Most of us spoke enough Indonesian so that we could carry on a
                    reasonable conversation. You could ask them how things were going, what about
                    the communists, etc. They were always accessible. They told us what we wanted to
                    hear, but they were accessible. We went all over the country. We couldn't travel
                    in areas where there was actual fighting going on, but just about everywhere
                    else.</p>

                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: I felt Indonesia was going pretty much to hell. I didn't know what was
                    going to happen to the country, except one niggling thought at the back of my
                    mind that these people were not fanatics, that there was an element of reason
                    behind most of them and they were not going to go over the precipice into
                    something like China in 1948. I thought, “There is a way out of this, and the
                    main obstacle is Sukarno.”</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>When I left Jakarta I had been overseas for 15 years so I had a tour of duty in
                    Washington. I initially spent two years as Desk officer for Australian Affairs.
                    It was a pleasant two years. My main job was negotiating and riding herd on
                    various defense agreements that we and the Australians were working on to use
                    Australian territory in satellite reconnaissance and other such projects. We
                    were just beginning to get into space.</p>
                <p>The Australians were probably the most cooperative of all our Allies at that
                    time. Our way of life was compatible so it was one of the military's favorite
                    countries for locating such installations as the one in Northwest Cape for
                    tracking submarines in the Indian Ocean. The Australians were totally
                    cooperative.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, these were the big China days, when the Sino- Soviet bloc was
                    coming apart and we worried most about China. We saw Australia as one of the
                    southern bastions against expanding Chinese power.</p>
                <p>It was a pleasant but not too exciting two years. Then I was named Indonesian
                    Desk officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was '62?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: 1962-65 I was Indonesian Desk officer. That was one of the more
                    fascinating, challenging jobs I have ever had because it was the time when
                    things were going from bad to worse with Sukarno in Indonesia. The Communist
                    Party, the PKI, by that time had become the third largest in the world after
                    China and the Soviet. Most of the members weren't dedicated Communists. For 90
                    percent of them, if you said “Marx” and they had been to a movie they would
                    think “Groucho.” They didn't necessarily know communism. All they knew was that
                    they were poor and there were richer people than they. The communists told them
                    they could have more goodies such as education for their children if they joined
                    the party. The Communist Party was growing by leaps and bounds.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Java is intrinsically a poor part of the world. I believe Java and Bangladesh are
                    the two most densely populated rural areas on earth. It is very fertile land but
                    mountainous. The Javanese had evolved a strange intricate system, a
                    labor-intensive society where everything was interlocked and ruled by tradition.
                    You couldn't cut the rice with a large scythe, you had to use little hand knives
                    and cut one grain at a time. The reason—you don't want to disturb the rice
                    goddess. The people are Muslims, but not intense Muslims. They would burn a
                    pinch of incense to the tree goddess before going to the mosque on Friday. But
                    basically the problem for them was to spread the labor. There were landowners
                    and the landless. It was the landless who became PKI members. The landowners
                    were not fat cats with huge holdings. Usually they owned only four or five
                    acres. And they lived on the land and their family worked on the land and they
                    hired landless labor to supplement their own work. And tradition dictated which
                    landless labor they hired and how many. It was a system in which some people
                    were much better off than others, but nobody was living really high on the
                    hog.</p>
                <p>Then the PKI moved in. They began to indoctrinate the landless labor, who had
                    plenty of reason to feel sorry for themselves. Into the intricate Javanese
                    system they brought a new element, a very disruptive element, that turned the
                    landless against the civil authorities and the peasants who had land...brought a
                    split into the society and threatened the society. Something was going to do
                    that anyway, I suppose. It greatly increased tension throughout Java and
                    tremendously increased the power of the Communist Party in Java.</p>
                <p>One of the PKI's main sources of strength was Sukarno. He was not a communist, he
                    saw himself above politics, but when he gave a speech...they were marvelous
                    speeches...the Communists could rally 100,000 people to stand and scream their
                    support. It was the Communist Party that could organize great numbers to march
                    through the streets and snarl at us while passing the American Embassy. They
                    were not anti-American because they didn't like Americans, they were
                    anti-American because they didn't like a country being so nasty to Sukarno.</p>
                <p>Anyway, it got worse and worse. Sukarno was using as one of his primary weapons
                    Indonesia's claim to West Irian, the Indonesian name for the former Netherlands
                    New Guinea, the western half of the island of New Guinea that the Dutch kept
                    from the Indonesians in 1949 when they conceded the rest of the Netherlands
                    Indies to the Indonesian nationalists. For years Sukarno insisted that West
                    Irian was part of Indonesia. The Dutch would claim that the people of West Irian
                    were not Indonesians, that they were totally different people and must be
                    protected by the Dutch until they were mature enough to become independent. They
                    had nothing to do with Indonesia, according to the Dutch.</p>
                <p>Well this wasn't true. The people of West Irian were not of Malay origin as were
                    most Indonesians but of Melanesian origin. But so were many thousands of people
                    in the eastern Indonesian islands, while millions more were a blend of Malay and
                    Melanesian. Getting West Irian from the Dutch became a great goal for Sukarno
                    and the Indonesians.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>The Indonesians pushed the issue in the United Nations and everywhere. Sukarno,
                    especially, used it for beating the West as a whole. It also split the State
                    Department because the Dutch were one of the most cooperative of all our NATO
                    Allies. Naturally the European Bureau said we couldn't do anything to upset the
                    Dutch while the East Asian Bureau was saying, look, you can't lose Indonesia
                    just to placate the Dutch.</p>
                <p>I was part of it. I was the one writing the East Asia Bureau's memos and position
                    papers, arguing with the European Desks and fighting the bureaucratic wars. The
                    end result was paralysis. The Administration's position became one of
                    neutrality, supporting neither the Indonesian nor the Dutch. Since the Dutch
                    physically held West Irian, we kept arguing that our policy wasn't so much
                    neutral as pro-Dutch.</p>
                <p>Anyway, this went on through the end of the Eisenhower Administration. Then
                    Kennedy came in and said, “Let's try an entirely new approach.” Let us try to
                    settle the West Irian issue, which we did. Ellsworth Bunker was named by Kennedy
                    to mediate the dispute and he did, with the active support of the White House.
                    By that time the Dutch were becoming just a little bit tired of the whole thing.
                    It was costing them a fortune. They were honest. Their principles were that the
                    people of West Irian were wards and they had to stay with them. They were also
                    madder than hell at the Indonesians because, after all, they had fought a 4-year
                    war of independence against the Dutch. So, with a good deal of prodding and
                    careful work by the Kennedy Administration, Bobby Kennedy in particular...it was
                    the only time I ever met him. I remember Jones and I went to call on him on one
                    occasion. Bobby Kennedy knew a surprising amount about Indonesia, Sukarno, West
                    Irian and all that. He had informed himself on the topic. And, yes, we worked
                    out a settlement between Indonesia and the Netherlands.</p>
                <p>Interestingly enough, way back in 1959 John Henderson, our political counselor in
                    Jakarta, got his political officers together and said, “Let us work out what we
                    think should happen. The big issue is West New Guinea. Let's have a seminar
                    among ourselves.” First we worked out a rationale for changing our policy— about
                    15-18 pages—and then a proposal for how to change it. I was the one assigned to
                    writing them up. They were not my ideas, they were joint ideas. Jones signed my
                    two despatches and sent them to Washington. And it was exactly the course we
                    eventually followed three years later.</p>
                <p>So the Kennedy Administration did work out the agreement that turned West Irian
                    over to the United Nations, just as we in Jakarta had proposed in 1959. The
                    United Nations governed it for a year and then held a sort of plebiscite.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would be pretty hard to hold a plebiscite.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Well, first of all they were holding a plebiscite asking people whether
                    they wanted to be part of Indonesia or part of the Netherlands. They were asking
                    a bunch of people who would reply: “What is Indonesia, what is the Netherlands?”
                    Anyway, West Irian was turned over to Indonesia. The next August 17, Indonesian
                    Independence Day, Sukarno entitled his speech “A Year of Triumph.”</p>
                <p>We thought, fine, everything is on track again, our great impediment is wiped out
                    and we will now be able to draw Indonesia back into “the free world.” Well that
                    lasted about a year and then the Brits decided to do something with Malaya and
                    Singapore and their North Borneo Territories, Sabah and Sarawak. The British
                    idea was to combine them into the new nation of Malaysia— a very sensible idea.
                    The Brits made one great mistake and I think privately they will admit it. If
                    they had gone to Sukarno at the very beginning and said they were thinking about
                    doing this and what did he think about it—work with him, it would have been
                    okay. But they completely... I think they just forgot to.</p>
                <p>So Malaysia is announced. Sukarno rises in wrath and complains, “I was not
                    consulted.” The next thing you know a little rebellion breaks out in Sarawak, I
                    think, and in Brunei. And the Indonesians support it by sending arms and
                    guerrillas across the border and we have the Malaysia/Sarawak/Borneo crisis. The
                    crisis continued right up to the end of the Sukarno regime. That got worse, and
                    worse and worse. Sukarno was supporting the overthrow of the Malaysia project.
                    We were saying, “No, no, please don't do it.” He was ignoring us. We still were
                    trying to capitalize on what we felt was the advantage gained from our role in
                    the West Irian settlement. Power had really corrupted him by that stage. He just
                    thought, “I can do no wrong.” And the Chinese and the Russians were flattering
                    the hell out of him. The Russians began to give him lots of modern military
                    equipment. We weren't terribly worried because the Indonesian army, good as it
                    was, wasn't on the same level as we were beginning to discover the North
                    Vietnamese army was. But in the early '60s, let's say '63, '64, '65, if you
                    stopped anybody in the State Department who had been dealing with East Asia, he
                    would be hard pressed to say whether the worse menace was in Vietnam or in
                    Indonesia. Of course, Indonesia was so much larger and more strategically
                    located than Vietnam. A lot of us thought “the hell with Vietnam; Indonesia is
                    where its going to happen.” Well, of course, it did in 1965.</p>
                <p>But in the meantime I was the Desk officer and I was getting it from all sides. I
                    never worked harder and longer in my life. I would get home about 8:00 at night.
                    The phone would ring at 2:00 in the morning and I would hear, “Hello, Mr.
                    Ingraham, this is the Watch Officer, I thought you would want to know they just
                    burned down the library in Surabaya.” And I would say, “For Christ sake, what am
                    I supposed to do about it at two a.m.?” He would say, “I don't know Mr.
                    Ingraham, I was just told to call you.” So I would lie awake the rest of the
                    night with my stomach churning.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Averell Harriman was Assistant Secretary for East Asia at
                        that time. How did he deal with you and what was his attitude towards
                        Indonesia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: It was interesting. He accepted, by and large, the Jones theory that we
                    had to hang on until the last bitter gasp because we gain nothing by leaving. By
                    this time we could easily have broken relations and taken action against...not
                    quite militarily, although military could have been on the horizon. Harriman
                    fought against this. He was a strange man. His factual knowledge of the area was
                    just about nil. He learned a bit, but he wasn't a great student. But he had the
                    most exquisitely honed political instincts. You would go up to him and say,
                    “This, this and this have happened. We think you should do this, this and this.”
                    He would ask some very sharp questions and then say, “Okay go ahead and do it.”
                    You could ask him, “Well, why do you think we should?” And he would snap, “Never
                    mind. Go ahead and do it.” The “never mind” was a way of saying, “I haven't the
                    faintest idea about the details of what you have proposed, but my instinct tells
                    me to do it.” And it was a good instinct.</p>
                <p>There was no one that Harriman would kowtow to. He fought our battles against the
                    European Bureau, which had switched about a bit. First it was the Dutch but now
                    it was the Brits, with the Indonesian attack on Malaysia. Of course, we also had
                    Malaysia in our area, so even within the East Asia Bureau there was somewhat of
                    a split. Meanwhile Jones was out there saying, “Hang on, hang on, hang on;”
                    seeing Sukarno probably every third day and saying, “For God's sake don't do
                    this.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling media and/or Congressional pressure about
                        this policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes. Once Evans or Novak—can't remember which— had me out for lunch at
                    the Metropolitan Club as I filled him in on Indonesian lore. Yeah. The press was
                    always calling me. Every morning we worked out the line we were going to use
                    with the press that day. I was in the middle of everything. I got hauled up to
                    the Hill for...actually I wasn't the main one, I would go along while Harriman
                    or more likely one of the Deputy Assistant Secretaries would go up to the Hill
                    to testify. Congress was always angry at Sukarno because he was so damn
                    flamboyant.</p>
                <p>So it went on, getting worse and worse and worse. Then came the night of
                    September 30, 1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were still Desk officer?</hi>

                    within a month everything...</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyway this was when Sukarno was successfully set aside by

                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes. One of the great unheralded events of the mid- 20th century, if
                    you think about it. Also, Jones, just a month or two earlier had finally been
                    pulled out. Sukarno had asked him to stay on, but we had just about reached the
                    stage where we felt it hadn't worked, so let's really put Sukarno in the enemy
                    camp and consider him along with the rest of the Sino-Soviet bloc. Just give up
                    on Sukarno and consider Indonesia hostile.</p>
                <p>Jones left Jakarta and Marshall Green, our Deputy Assistant Secretary, was
                    appointed Ambassador. I remember his speech for use when he presented his
                    credentials. He never used the speech because the presentation of his
                    credentials was done in the dead of night. Sort of, “I'll take your credentials,
                    now go away.”</p>
                <p>He had only been there a couple of months—hard, hard months— when September 30
                    came up.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that assignment come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: I haven't the faintest idea. I did not want to go to Rangoon. I wanted
                    to go back to the more open world of Southeast Asia, to Malaysia or perhaps even
                    back to Indonesia, but there was Burma. So with some trepidations off we went to
                    Burma. It turned out to be a pleasant but not terribly exciting three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Burma when you went there? You
                        were there from '66-'69.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Burma was a country whose first contact with the Western world came in
                    1825. Earlier they had been the great conquerors of Southeast Asia on several
                    occasions. They thought a great deal of themselves. In 1825 they got into a war
                    with the Brits. They thought, “We have beaten and occupied Thailand; we even
                    have beaten the center of all power in the universe, China.” (They in fact had
                    done so in a border war.) “So here are the Brits over there in India; lets take
                    over Assam.” So they sent their army off to take over Assam and they beat the
                    hell out of the Brits. But the one thing the Brits had that the Chinese didn't
                    have was a navy. So while they were beating the British in Assam, the British
                    navy was seizing Rangoon and that was the end of the war. And, as the Burmese
                    would tell us, ever since then, every contact with the outside world has been a
                    disaster.</p>
                <p>They had another war with the Brits in 1852 and lost more territory. Finally in
                    the 1870s there was the third Burma War which ended up with all of Burma being
                    annexed by the Brits and made a part of India. The latter was even worse than
                    being annexed. The British didn't actually mistreat the Burmese. They pretty
                    much ignored the Burmese and didn't recognize Burma's separate existence.</p>
                <p>Then came World War II. The Burmese welcomed the Japanese with open arms until
                    the Japanese made it very clear that they were going to behave in a way that
                    even the British never did.</p>
                <p>So the Burmese at that stage became even more convinced that every time the
                    outside world comes to them, it is a disaster.</p>
                <p>In the late '40s and '50s Burma pretty well fell apart. There was a democratic
                    government in Rangoon with several very well meaning people...U Nu was one of
                    them, a saintly man. I met him years ago when he came to Washington. He just was
                    not the kind of leader to hold the country together. When it inevitably fell
                    apart, the army commander, Ne Win, took power. He straightened things out and
                    turned the government back to the civilians, who proceeded to screw up again, so
                    Ne Win threw them out and took power for the second time just before we
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ne Win was in the saddle when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes. He was married to his second wife, Kitty.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The whole time we were in Burma our governments got along reasonably well. It was
                    a country that wasn't causing us any trouble. And there were virtually no
                    American commercial or private interests in the country. We used to laugh and
                    say, “Well, we had the American business community in for dinner last night,
                    with his wife and two lovely children.” It was a totally isolated place. We were
                    dutifully reporting what was going on in Burma to Washington, but Washington's
                    interest by that time was all Vietnam. Nobody cared about Burma, which was more
                    or less what the Burmese wanted. Except...there was something called the Burmese
                    way to socialism, which was socialism with an ethnic cast to it...to us
                    socialism involves public control, government ownership, etc., but to the
                    Burmese it was much more simple. Capitalism—you walked into a store to buy
                    something and there was an Indian sitting behind the counter; Socialism—the
                    Indian was back in India and there was a Burmese sitting behind the counter.
                    That was what Ne Win and his people imposed on Burma. Unfortunately the Burmese
                    sitting behind the counter didn't know what to do next when the shelves were
                    bare. So that was Burma for three years.</p>
                <p>Now things have gone to hell. Ne Win has grown old, brutal and mean. But in those
                    days the country was doing about as well as it could. There was a loosening up
                    when we were there. U Nu was let out of prison along with various others from
                    his era. Burma was doing, in every way except economically, reasonably well. It
                    was a fairly quiet period in Burmese history.</p>
                <p>One thing about Burma I soon discovered, after serving in India and
                    Indonesia...Burma was always listed among the very poorest countries of the
                    world in those days. Its per capita GNP was below even India's. But I would go
                    out into the countryside and there would be no comparison whatsoever. The rural
                    Burmese were infinitely better off than the people of India. It was just that
                    they were largely outside the monetized economy. We were free to travel almost
                    all over Burma and we did. (You can't do that now and you couldn't do it
                    before.) We had no trouble anywhere. We were welcomed everywhere. Wherever we
                    went we found a relatively prosperous countryside. The cities were pretty much
                    of a mess. They were not magnets. They hadn't drawn people from the countryside,
                    partly because the cities had so little to offer and the countryside so much to
                    offer. The current picture we have of most of the third world is of these
                    massive Mexico Cities with their 15 million people. That wasn't happening in
                    Burma. You had a society that really wasn't badly off at all, except for some of
                    the people in the cities.</p>
                <p>Every time we would go to Thailand, on business or for a weekend shopping tour,
                    we would have about 15 Burmese friends asking us to bring back such exotic
                    things as a fan belt for a 1961 Ford. Would you bring us some toothpaste? Things
                    like that. We would go to Bangkok and come back loaded down. The Burmese customs
                    were easy going. Once I brought back 144 tennis balls. It was a pleasant, not
                    terribly busy life.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>One thing that was fascinating about Rangoon at that time was...this was a
                    totally neutral country. It was so neutral that it wouldn't even join the
                    neutral nations. Because of that, everybody was represented in Rangoon. We had
                    North Koreans, South Koreans, North Vietnamese, South Vietnamese, East Germans,
                    West Germans, the whole schmear was there. And because there was so little else
                    to do, and the Burmese government, while it was more or less approachable, kept
                    all foreigners at arms' lengths...we could always call on them but we didn't get
                    much out of them. Burmese officials rarely came to our houses; many would have
                    loved to come but they didn't quite dare. At the same time they were friendly
                    and available when necessary. So the diplomatic corps was thrown in on itself,
                    and it was one place in the world where virtually all of us were represented.
                    There was a hotel, the Inya Lake, where (given the 50 or so countries
                    represented) about once a week we would have a national day, and the reception
                    would always be there. We would all find ourselves thrown in together. The East
                    Germans and the West Germans...that cute East German girl and all the rest. This
                    was the height of the Cold War and we were not supposed to be that friendly with
                    each other.</p>
                <p>One of my jobs was to work fairly closely with the South Vietnamese
                    representative and the Cambodian representative, particularly the South
                    Vietnamese. We would share things with him and let him use our facilities now
                    and then. And we would pass information back to Washington that he couldn't get
                    to Saigon, that kind of thing. He was a very decent man. I can't think of his
                    name. He was a career type, hard working. He was making no dent on the Burmese,
                    but then again neither were the North Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had two rather hard-charging ambassadors while you
                        were there—Henry Byroade and Art Hummel. How did they operate in this sort
                        of benign atmosphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Ah. It wasn't quite benign at the beginning. I arrived shortly after
                    Byroade. Now, back in the '50s we had briefly supported the KMT army that had
                    been chased out of Western China and ended up in northern Burma. We had provided
                    arms for them and encouraged them to go back in to China, which I think they did
                    once or twice and got the hell beat out of them. Then they decided opium
                    cultivating was easier. The Burmese were deeply suspicious of us because we had
                    initially supported the KMT army. They didn't like it. They had a centuries-old
                    distrust of China and suspected we were trying to force them into our orbit.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Then Byroade, a former military man and trouble-shooter, arrived. Tense
                    situation. The Burmese were sure we were up to no good. Byroade's first move,
                    oddly enough, was to...Ed Law Yone had been the editor of the local newspaper,
                    had run afoul of the military and had been carted off to jail. Ed Law Yone had a
                    Rolls Royce. He sold it to Byroade, who had it taken to the Embassy residence.
                    Byroade himself took that car apart down to the last bearing and put it back
                    together, adding leopard skin seats and teak paneling. He would spend most of
                    the day at the residence working on the car. You would ask, “What the hell is
                    the Ambassador doing?” The answer was that Byroade knew exactly what he was
                    doing. Hank figured out that the Burmese were suspicious of him and assumed he
                    was engaged in all sorts of covert doings. Military background, all that kind of
                    stuff, had been in Egypt and everywhere. They would be certain he was up to no
                    good. So he showed them utter relaxation. He would come into the office about
                    10:00 in the morning (the Burmese would be following him) and leave early. The
                    Burmese would wonder what nefarious activities he was engaged in, and then the
                    word would get back to the Burmese security people that he was back under that
                    car again. I thought it was a brilliant bit of psychological diplomacy.</p>
                <p>The thing is, Byroade rather liked it that way too. Byroade was not one of the
                    world's workaholics by any means. But in this case he was doing exactly what
                    needed doing. It was done consciously. At the very beginning he disarmed the
                    Burmese by showing he was not out there to take over their country. Then he
                    began to work on Ne Win. He established a sort of a friendship with Kitty Ne
                    Win, the wife. Byroade was known as quite a lady's man. We used to laugh in
                    Rangoon and say, “When the British Ambassador or the Chinese Ambassador talked
                    to Kitty Ne Win they were talking to the wife of the Head of State. When Byroade
                    talked to her, he was talking to a woman and she knew it.” She got to rather
                    like him and then so did Ne Win. They would invite Byroade to the Palace and
                    that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>So he maintained as good relations as he could with the Burmese, despite their
                    touchy, scrupulous neutrality. It was a rather pleasant three years.</p>

                    I had a team of analysts working for me who in some cases had had experience in
                    the country and others who had had years of experience in INR working on the

                <p>INGRAHAM: It was almost an enclosed system, the parts I was working on, because
                    Vietnam had become the center of everything. I didn't handle Vietnam, Evelyn
                    Colbert did. All the people higher up wanted to know about was Vietnam. We were
                    getting swept up into Vietnam during that period.</p>

                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes, Indonesia had gone through its convolution. Malaysia was doing

                    Indonesia was amazed. Nothing much was going on in the areas I covered.
                    Everything was Vietnam. So my job was relatively easy. We drafted analyses which

                    Islamabad so I made a few phone calls saying, “I would love it.” Next thing I

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Now this was a crucial, key period in Pakistan's history. It was
                    exciting to be there. When I arrived in the summer of '71, there had been quite
                    a cataclysm in Pakistan. After years of a rather benign dictatorship under Ayub
                    Khan, for some weird reason the government decided to hold free elections. So
                    they held free elections. Now the majority of Pakistanis were Bengalis from East
                    Pakistan—55 million to 45 million, something like that—but the country from the
                    beginning had been run totally from the West. There was something called rather
                    condescendingly “second capital” in Dhaka. The Punjabis ran the country. The
                    Bengalis were second-class citizens, even though most of the foreign exchange
                    came from East Bengal—jute primarily. So you had a country of two separate
                    people who spoke different languages, with totally different cultures. The only
                    thing they had in common was Islam. And because of the strange doings of the
                    Indian partition of 1947, the two parts of the country were separated by a
                    thousand miles of India. By the time I got there it seemed utterly doomed. They
                    had held those free elections. All the Bengalis had united behind Sheikh Mujib
                    and his party. In the West meanwhile there were three or four parties. The
                    Bengalis had won an absolute majority in the parliament in Islamabad. The East
                    Pakistanis had taken over the government lock, stock and barrel. Well, the West
                    Pakistani politicians and the army simply couldn't stand this. So they promptly
                    annulled the election, threw everybody in jail, declared martial law, sent the
                    Punjabi army to East Pakistan and the debacle started.</p>
                <p>The East Pakistanis were supported diplomatically and materially by India. The
                    Pakistan army in East Pakistan behaved very badly, not quite as badly as the
                    Iraqis, but on that level. They didn't really consider the Bengalis to be fellow
                    citizens. They considered them groveling, inferior beings. They shot them up,
                    raped, murdered, burned down villages, etc. India began supporting Bengali
                    guerrillas coming in from India. Hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions,
                    of refugees moved into adjoining India, putting a terrific strain on the
                    Indians. The Indians stepped up their aid to the guerrillas to get rid of
                    Pakistani control and permit the refugees to go home.</p>
                <p>So we had the crisis. We were sitting in Islamabad, we had a consulate in Dhaka.
                    I remember spending three weeks in Dhaka in October 1971.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Arch Blood was the Consul General at that time wasn't
                        he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes, he was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see a problem between your being in Islamabad and
                        having your contacts seeing it one way and then the Consul General in East
                        Pakistan seeing it another way? Did this cause problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Not really. Some problems but not as many as you might think. We in
                    Islamabad, particularly after my trip to Dhaka, realized that...from the time I
                    arrived we believed Pakistan was doomed. A split was inevitable. In fact it had
                    already occurred. But Washington wouldn't believe this. And so our quarrel was
                    with Washington, yet at the same time we didn't want to tell Washington to
                    switch policy. At that time we had a more or less neutral policy. Unfortunately
                    it got hung up with Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon and their globaloney. They
                    saw Pakistan as a firm base for CENTO—Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran, the eternal
                    Iran standing as the center piece. Washington was pro-Pakistan. We had built,
                    supported and maintained the Pakistanis. Years earlier Ayub Khan had come to
                    Washington and said, “I have one of the finest armies in Asia and it will be at
                    your disposal. All I need are the weapons.” And he got them. But by 1971 we had
                    a not-very- bright general in charge in Islamabad, General Yahya Khan.</p>
                <p>We in Islamabad found ourselves at odds more with Washington than we did with
                    Dhaka in this period leading up to the December 1971 war. Washington—Henry
                    Kissinger—had looked at a map and said, “We need this piece of real estate.
                    Forget what is happening inside the country. It is a part of my overall strategy
                    to surround the Soviet Union.” Pakistan was also a member of SEATO— the bridge
                    country between SEATO and CENTO. To the highest levels in Washington, Pakistan
                    wasn't a country approaching chaos but a piece of the global jigsaw puzzle. So
                    we found ourselves constantly bickering with Washington.</p>
                <p>Now the internal structure of the Embassy was rather strange at that time because
                    we had an ambassador who was, to put it mildly, a lightweight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Joe Farland. He had been head of a large coal company in West Virginia.
                    He had become head by hard work, perspicacity and marrying the boss' daughter.
                    It was the Christopher Coal Company and her maiden name was Christopher. Farland
                    was a heavy contributor to the Republican Party and had bought ambassadorships
                    before—in the Dominican Republic under Trujillo. To show the depth of his
                    political perception, he once said, “Ed, you don't understand; Trujillo was a
                    fine man, he was just misled by evil companions.” I said, “Oh, is that so Mr.
                    Ambassador.” Fortunately he had a deputy, Sid Sober. The Ambassador generally
                    realized that he didn't really know what was going on so he let Sid Sober run
                    the Embassy. He made lots of trips back to the States—business trips where he
                    would be gone for a month or so with his family. He also had a lovely place up
                    in the hill station, Murree, about 50 miles out of Islamabad, and every Friday,
                    or Thursday if he could, he would go up and spend the weekend. He would be
                    closeted there, drinking and playing games and that sort of things. He loved to
                    fish too. Then he would come back to Islamabad Sunday or Monday.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Sid Sober, meanwhile, ran the show. Fortunately, as I say, Farland realized that
                    foreign policy was not his bag and that he had a good deputy. He didn't put his
                    finger in the machinery very often.</p>
                <p>In late 1971, of course, things went from bad to worse. We had a teenage daughter
                    who was going to boarding school in India. My wife and I drove across the border
                    in November 1971, and on up to Mussoorie in India; picked up our daughter from
                    the school; spent a little time traveling around India; and then drove back
                    across the border on December 3. Rather than spending the night at Lahore, we
                    decided to drive straight on to Islamabad. The roads were clogged with army
                    trucks. As we pulled into our driveway in Islamabad the air raid sirens went off
                    and the war started. Had I been one day later, the Political Counselor at the
                    Embassy in Islamabad would have been on the Indian side of the border for the
                    duration.</p>
                <p>We were in Islamabad throughout the war, but it only lasted two weeks. Our DCM,
                    who had been running the Embassy, was on home leave in the States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sid Sober.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Sid Sober. Joe Farland was trying to run the Embassy. He had no idea
                    what to do, so he did nothing. By coincidence, that was exactly what we should
                    have done. Sheer accident but it worked. We didn't evacuate, although most of
                    the other embassies did. We kept our people there. We did evacuate the staff
                    from the Lahore consulate general.</p>
                <p>It was a strange war. Blackout curtains. The Indians never touched Islamabad, but
                    the airport was just a few miles away. I can remember in the evenings, in this
                    lovely city with mountain ranges surrounding us and jackals howling, we would go
                    out on our upstairs terrace just after sunset and sit, surrounded by flowers and
                    potted palms, with the servants padding in and out keeping our glasses filled,
                    while we watched the Indian air force bomb the airport. One of the airplanes
                    they hit belonged to the head of our military mission in Islamabad, a fellow
                    named Chuck Yeager.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. One of the first astronauts.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>INGRAHAM: He was the first man to break the sound barrier and he was quite a
                    hero. Chuck Yeager had a small plane assigned to him, that he used to use
                    primarily to fly the ambassador around the country on fishing trips. Well, an
                    Indian fighter plane came racing down the runway and saw only two planes there
                    so he took them both out. I remember Yeager coming in, shouting, “This is an
                    atrocity. They knew it was my plane. This is an insult to the President of the
                    United States. They are going to pay for this.” I said, “Chuck, the Indian pilot
                    is coming in over an enemy airport at 500 miles an hour and is under fire. He
                    sees an airplane, what does he do, check the registration?” Chuck looked at me
                    and said, “You are disloyal.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say that you were probably doing the right thing by
                        doing nothing, but were you getting the feeling that our Embassy in New
                        Delhi was weighing in India-wise, or did you find...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes, the Embassy in Delhi was weighing in very definitely. I forget who
                    our Ambassador was at that time, but yes, they were definitely at odds with
                    Washington. We were half on their side, because we felt the war ought to stop
                    and India should end it once Bangladesh had broken off. Washington was charging
                    that Indira Gandhi intended to send her army into what was left of
                    Pakistan...the Pakistanis were absolutely convinced that the Indians were going
                    to reverse the 1947 partition and reabsorb them. The Pakistanis started the war,
                    incidentally. Their armies were being decimated in East Pakistan. Indian
                    intervention was becoming ever more open, so the Pakistanis took a deep breath
                    and said, “Lets attack in the West.”</p>
                <p>The war only lasted two weeks. Wisely, Indira Gandhi blew the whistle and stopped
                    the war without taking any Pakistani territory as soon as the Pakistani general
                    in the East surrendered. The defeat caused a turnover in Pakistan. Yahya
                    Khan...a decent man I guess, not very bright, drank a lot—he was the only man
                    Joe Farland knew in the government because he would call Farland over to drink
                    with him. He didn't want to talk about politics, he just wanted a drinking
                    partner. Farland was dense enough so that the two of them got along quite
                    well.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Yahya Khan resigned. It was a sad resignation, because the war had been
                    lost, and he had had a great deal to drink and his voice came over the
                    radio—they didn't show him on television, they simply showed the radio. His last
                    act was to order the execution of Sheikh Mujib. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto suddenly
                    emerged as the new leader. The first thing he did was to cancel the execution.
                    He then put Mujib on a plane and had him flown to England, saving his life.
                    Bhutto then became first Prime Minister and then President.</p>
                <p>Bhutto was one of the most fascinating characters ever. He had great flaws. He
                    was egotistical, somewhat dishonest, but he also was a man of considerable
                    brilliance and he wanted the best for Pakistan. I did see a fair amount of him.
                    He was a person you could hardly trust but very often admire. He saved Pakistan,
                    which was utterly demoralized by that defeat.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>In the Embassy, Farland stayed on during the war. Late in the war—it may have
                    been over—Sid Sober had managed to fly back as far as Kabul, get a car down to
                    the border and slip into Islamabad just in time for the war's end. As soon as
                    the war was over, Farland felt he had to go back to the States on business, so
                    he disappeared. He was back in the States for quite an extended period. Suddenly
                    we heard that he had been named Ambassador to Iran. So he moved his personal
                    entourage to Iran. He was there only a few months when Washington had to do
                    something about Dick Helms, so they bumped Farland and sent him as Ambassador to
                    Iran in Farland's place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Pakistan when Bhutto was there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Bhutto took over in January 1971. I left in the summer of 1974, so it
                    was a couple of years. Most of this time, for two years—for reasons that to this
                    day I am not quite sure of- -Sid Sober was Charg�. No ambassador was appointed.
                    During the first few months, of course, Farland was the ostensible ambassador,
                    but when he was appointed to Tehran in the late spring, nobody replaced Sid
                    Sober. Sid remained chief of mission. Sid was the one who, with me at his
                    shoulder, would frequently see Bhutto. Sid knew him better than anyone.</p>
                <p>It was a fascinating time, because Pakistan was reforming itself as a totally
                    different nation. All its perceptions had to be completely changed. It was no
                    longer vital to India. It had one-eighth the population of India. Its army had
                    been humiliated. Bangladesh was no longer part of Pakistan. The country began to
                    look inward. Now, without Bangladesh, Pakistan actually became a sort of nation.
                    They had four different ethnic groups, all of them bloodthirsty. But each could
                    see that they had more in common with each other, with one exception, than any
                    of them had with the outside.</p>
                <p>I remember when I first arrived in Pakistan, back in the summer of 1971. I had
                    never been there before. I knew India reasonably well, but I had no idea of what
                    Pakistan was like. I remember the first weekend, my wife and I got into our car
                    and drove down to Rawalpindi. We walked into our first Pakistani store and five
                    minutes later I turned to Susan and said, “This is India.” It was the last time
                    we ever said that, but we had discovered what Pakistan was—Pakistan is India.
                    The culture is, shall we say, South Asian subcontinent. The Pakistani generals
                    would have had nothing in common with, lets say, the generals of Iran. But those
                    same Pakistani generals could talk for hours with their old classmates from
                    military school who ran the Indian army. So Pakistan, in those days, anyway, was
                    really India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Bhutto as far as his policy towards
                        us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: During this period, quite favorably. When war broke out, Nixon said,
                    “We don't want to be neutral, we want to tilt toward Pakistan.”</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Kissinger, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: We sent one of our aircraft carriers...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Enterprise or one of those.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes. ...to the Indian Gulf. It had absolutely no effect on India
                    because by that time the Indians had ended the fighting. We tried to claim that
                    if it hadn't been for us the Indians would have kept right on going, but no such
                    thing.</p>
                <p>So with a favorable initial outlook from Washington, we considered Bhutto pretty
                    good. He didn't do anything wrong during the period I was there. Later on he
                    stole an election that he would have won honestly, anyway. That was one of his
                    flaws: he couldn't be satisfied with 60 percent, had to have 90 percent. So his
                    lieutenants went out and stole the election for him. That was the last straw for
                    the army and he was overthrown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: That was about '75, '76. And then, of course, he was charged with
                    murder. It was a trumped-up case. I suspect he ordered murders in his day, but
                    then so had General Zia, who had him hanged. Bhutto was hanged as a common
                    criminal And then there was that extraordinary period a decade later when his
                    daughter became Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Islamabad in...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back for a period to Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Three years. I was country director for Indonesia, Malaysia and
                    Singapore. It was a good job, but I was sorry to leave Pakistan because it had
                    been so damn fascinating and you always had the feeling of being in on
                    something.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Oh yes, just before I left, Byroade came in as Ambassador. So I didn't serve much
                    under Byroade in Pakistan although I had served under him in Burma for two
                    years. It took only a short time to realize he was going to get along fine with
                    Bhutto. Byroade was determined to do the right thing by Pakistan. When he first
                    came...that was when Moynihan was in Delhi and Byroade was in Islamabad...Delhi
                    was sending in some brilliant cables, drafted by the political section, no
                    doubt, but it was obvious that Moynihan was editing a bit, spicing them up. As
                    political counselor I had the job of trying to match Moynihan's prose. I would
                    write what I thought was a sparkling rejoinder, saying, in effect, “Whatever
                    Delhi may say, what really is happening is this.” I would send them in to
                    Byroade. He would whittle them down, deleting all of my brilliant, sparkling
                    phrases. I was furious at first but then I realized what he was doing. He would
                    calculate, “We can't beat Moynihan in sparkling phrases, so we are going to go
                    to the other extreme. We are going to tell Washington, 'Aw shucks, we can't
                    write like that book-learnin' fellow over there in Delhi, but we have the
                    honest, unvarnished truth to tell you from over here.'” So my cables would be
                    butchered. But he knew what he was doing. We held our own, thanks to
                    Byroade.</p>

                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: There were only a few things going on. There was the East Timor
                    business, which the outside world seized upon. A great deal of righteousness in
                    that one. I was on the minority side. We found ourselves being hauled before
                    Congress to testify.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the issue was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: All right. In 1949 Indonesia replaced the Dutch East Indies with one
                    small exception. Jakarta did not take over the eastern half of the small island
                    of Timor, which was a Portuguese colony and had been one since the 16th century.
                    The Dutch had chased the Portuguese out of most of East Asia, but they left them
                    in the eastern part of Timor for some reason. For 300 years it was a decaying
                    little Portuguese colony—not the island of Timor, just the eastern half. The
                    people on both sides of the island were the same. They spoke the same language.
                    The Indonesians put no pressure on the Portuguese. They were perfectly content.
                    Even Sukarno was content to leave Timor alone. And after Sukarno, Suharto
                    couldn't care less about East Timor. He felt the Portuguese colony would sooner
                    or later revert to Indonesia...it would have to because it was part of
                    Indonesia. But there were more important things to do, so no pressure.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Then there was an upheaval in Portugal when everything was overturned and its
                    empire fell apart. The echoes were felt in Timor. Three parties immediately
                    sprang up. One was pro- Indonesian, one was “let us stay the way we are,” and
                    the third and smallest was for independence. The independence party wasn't
                    influenced by Lisbon, but, as far as I can tell, by Mozambique. Frelimo in
                    Mozambique was a sort of mother party to the outfit called Fretilin—this is an
                    acronym—in East Timor.</p>
                <p>In short order in East Timor there was turmoil. Fighting among the three parties
                    began. It was not particularly serious and was not encouraged by the
                    Indonesians, who couldn't care less at that time. But then, the Portuguese
                    colonial government suddenly and unexpectedly packed up and left. First it moved
                    to an island off shore, apparently because it was getting sick of the low-level
                    turmoil. Their attitude was, “We are going to lose the colony anyway, one way or
                    another, so why should we lose any Portuguese lives.”</p>
                <p>And at the same time the Portuguese garrison was pulled out. Now, the Portuguese
                    garrison wasn't mainland Portuguese but Portuguese African mainly from
                    Mozambique, and had been infected by the radical currents in Mozambique stirred
                    up when the Portuguese pulled out. So when the garrison left, it turned over its
                    arms to the left wing, pro-independence party in East Timor, which promptly,
                    with those brand new guns, seized Dili, defeated the other parties and declared
                    themselves independent.</p>
                <p>The Indonesians suddenly woke up, saying, “We don't care about a Portuguese
                    colony in the middle of Indonesia, but to have an assertive left-wing state....”
                    The Indonesians are even more emotionally anti-communist than we were because of
                    their 1965 experience...They said, “Well, this can't be” and very quickly they
                    simply moved in. They moved in by force and they chased Fretilin out.</p>
                <p>The majority of the East Timor people, did they want union with Indonesia? No.
                    Did the majority of the people want independence under Fretilin? No. The
                    majority of the people had a vague idea that they were part of a Portuguese
                    colony but were totally outside the political dispute. The Portuguese, I think,
                    claimed that they had about 30 percent of the population under “administrative
                    control.” The rest were just living as they always had. It was a very poor
                    island.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Unfortunately, there was a strange little sidelight on all this. In World War II,
                    in 1942, when the Japanese were advancing down the Indonesian island chain, the
                    Australians had sent a small garrison to try to hold on to East Timor. They hung
                    on after the Japanese had taken the rest of the island chain all the way to New
                    Guinea. The Japanese then landed in Timor...the Australian garrison was still
                    there...and the Japanese really slaughtered the Timorese. The Australian
                    garrison was pulled out, but the Japanese punished the Timorese badly. Because
                    of this, the Australians have always had a guilty conscience about Timor. There
                    was also a little group in Australia that kept up a close interest in Timor,
                    including one Jimmy Dunn, who was something or other in the Australian
                    government...librarian of the Parliamentary Library, I believe...and who started
                    a drive to “Save Timor from the Indonesians.” When he came to the States, he
                    testified before Congress and stirred up a lot of worldwide agitation. Also a
                    number of the African countries lined up behind Fretilin, even though their
                    leaders couldn't have located Timor on a map. A lot of countries went after
                    Indonesia on this one. In fact a majority of the United Nations was against
                    Indonesia. But we stuck with the Indonesians throughout the whole thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling pressure on the Desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Yes, we were feeling a great deal of pressure from Congress. But the
                    State Department stayed solidly behind Indonesia. We said we were ostensibly
                    neutral, we understood the Indonesian point of view and we would stand by
                    Indonesia. I remember a meeting with Kissinger...A vote was coming up in the UN
                    to condemn Indonesia and we were planning to abstain. I remember somebody else
                    and I went up to talk to Kissinger. We said, “We realize we are going to have to
                    abstain, but the Indonesians have a real case here, and if there is any way that
                    we could support them on this, because it is unfair”—we were really quite
                    eloquent. And by God, when the vote came up and we went up to New York we were
                    told to vote “no”, rather than abstain. All the Europeans abstained, everybody
                    else voted yes and the United States and some of the Arab countries voted no.
                    The Indonesians have always been grateful for that, because we actually stood up
                    for them.</p>
                <p>But it caused a lot of criticism. Even religion was dragged into it,
                    unfortunately. The Timorese are basically Catholics on both sides of the island.
                    Jimmy Dunn and the Australians, along with several congregations in the United
                    States, were charging that Christians were being slaughtered by the Indonesians.
                    The Indonesians had moved in rather smartly and had been more brutal than they
                    had to be, although less brutal than they could have been. Partly because the
                    people in Fretilin were not cynics but actually believed in their cause, they
                    fought like tigers, didn't give up but retreated back into the hinterland. The
                    hinterland was being decimated as the Indonesian army went in after them. Their
                    fanatic resistance goaded the Indonesians into being rougher than they should
                    have been.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>So it was a very unhappy situation throughout. And the religious side of it... I
                    can remember Jimmy Dunn testifying before Congress that it was not only ethnic
                    genocide but religious warfare, with Christians being mistreated by the
                    Indonesians. I had already testified, so I managed to slip a note to someone
                    saying, “Point out that the Indonesian Minister of Defense is a Protestant and
                    the Indonesian General in charge of the Timor operation is a Catholic. This is
                    not a religious war.” Much of the propaganda to the outside world continued to
                    be along those lines. It never has died out. To this day you can see periodic
                    references in the papers to the atrocity of East Timor. It wasn't that, and it
                    never has been. It was just a poor remote little community that got caught up in
                    something that it wasn't prepared for and I don't know who you blame for this.
                    The Australians were wrong, but they believed it. The fanatics in the mountains,
                    Fretilin, believed they were fighting for a greater future for mankind. The
                    Indonesians were utterly convinced that they were simply taking back half an
                    island right smack in the middle of their country that had been forcibly
                    separated for centuries. The African countries felt they were trying to save
                    their people from Asian terror. So it was a very sad situation.</p>

                <p>INGRAHAM: John was a straightforward, hard working ambassador and a joy to work
                    for. We had a nice little post going for us in Singapore. No big problems, but
                    busy. We had lots of American businesses. They would have their headquarters in
                    Singapore and operations throughout Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>Singaporeans were active on the world stage. Lee Kuan Yew loved being on that
                    stage. They were also very sophisticated, very shrewd and they realized the
                    future of Singapore depended on their making Singapore recognized in this world.
                    Otherwise, little by little, they would disappear into Malaysia or Indonesia
                    unless they could establish a real Singapore personality. Which they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you and the Embassy view Lee Kuan Yew?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: We admired him greatly. You could talk to him. Lee was a very shrewd,
                    smart person. He was quite enamored of his own intelligence, but in this case it
                    was justified. He knew facts, relationships and was decisive making up his mind
                    quickly. He was the boss. I remember people talking about an oppressive
                    atmosphere in Singapore. Nonsense. It is the only country in all of Southeast
                    Asia that has held free elections, and I mean really free elections, every four
                    years from the very beginning. In between times Lee really rode herd on the
                    country. But every four years everybody had a chance to say “in” or “out,” and
                    they always said “in.” I can remember people saying the Singapore elections had
                    to be dishonest because they have one oppositionist and some 70 government MPs.
                    I would say, “This is a city government. It is like Chicago and the Daly machine
                    that made the city run. This is the same sort of machine in Singapore, but
                    honest.”</p>
                <p>One thing about Lee Kuan Yew that most people didn't realize... I would stroll
                    down Orchard Road, the main shopping street, walk into a jewelry store and there
                    would be an elderly, pleasant man working behind the counter. I would chat with
                    him...it was Lee Kuan Yew's father. If you wanted Chinese cooking lessons, you
                    signed up with Lee Kuan Yew's mother. This was when he was Prime Minister of the
                    country. Talk about squeaky clean honesty! It was in a way an ideal society,
                    sort of a platonic society. They were engaged in all sorts of social
                    engineering. For example, if every Singaporean lived in a separate house, the
                    whole island would have been paved over. It was a beautiful green island with a
                    huge forest reserve in the center, park land, open space everywhere. To preserve
                    all this, they decided they had to go up. So they built high-rises. Right now
                    more than 75 percent of the entire population lives in government-owned
                    high-rise apartments. They were taking Chinese out of little storefront shops,
                    Malays out of Kampong, and putting them in high-rises. It was difficult but it
                    was the best solution.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I remember talking to the Minister for Housing once, saying, “I am sorry to tell
                    you this but in the '50s, '60s and even in the '40s we tried this same thing in
                    New York—Stuyvesant Town, Peter Cooper Village, they started out fine but ended
                    up disasters. You have to realize this.” He said, “Hell, I spent six years in
                    New York studying those places. We know what the flaws were.” It is that kind of
                    country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1979.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: Unexpectedly. Holdridge was transferred in the spring of '78. I was
                    Charg� for about four months. Then in the late summer of '78 the new Ambassador
                    came, appointed by Jimmy Carter. It was the sitting governor of South Dakota,
                    Richard Kneip, who for reasons of South Dakota politics decided he wasn't going
                    to run again. So he asked Washington for a job. He hadn't thought about
                    ambassadorships. His wife once told me, “While we were offered various jobs in
                    Washington [as a governor to another governor in a sense, although he always
                    overplayed his intimacy with Carter] it seemed that we would have to have a very
                    active social life and do a lot of entertaining if we took one of them, so we
                    decided to take the job over here instead.” I gulped and thought, “Oh my God!”
                    He was quite a disaster as ambassador. Happily, Singapore was not a country
                    where we had any real troubles. The Singaporeans were sophisticated people, they
                    understood why he was there. They were even a bit flattered that someone had
                    asked to come to Singapore. We found ways of working around him.</p>
                <p>I wrote an article on this for the Foreign Service Journal once. It started out
                    rather early when his secretary came scuttling out of his office saying, “Hey,
                    he just asked where Jakarta is!” The Ambassador's office in Singapore looks out
                    over the Strait and the land visible in the distance is Indonesia. Very shortly,
                    it turned out that he didn't know there were two different Koreas. One time he
                    called me in and said, “Ed, I have these maps here. This one says East Pakistan
                    and West Pakistan. The other one says Pakistan and Bangladesh. Bangladesh? What
                    happened Ed?” Questions like that. He had never heard of Chiang Kai-shek. He
                    didn't know who Gandhi was—maybe he had heard the name somewhere. He had heard
                    of Churchill but I don't think he knew of Attlee. This was a mind absolutely
                    barren of any awareness of the entire outside world. Totally barren.</p>
                <p>On his first call on Rajaratnam, the Foreign Minister, it became embarrassing
                    because Rajaratnam would say, “Well, what about this?” The Ambassador would say,
                    “Well...” and look at me and I would have to carry on. Then he would say, “Yes,
                    that's right...” He was a man of a good deal of pride. He didn't like it. We got
                    along in a rather rocky way. He hadn't the faintest idea what an ambassador
                    did.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Apparently in South Dakota the perks of the governor are extraordinary—a summer
                    palace, etc. I was the one who had to keep going in and saying, “Dick, I am
                    sorry, you can't do it this way.” I would try to find ways around it...then he
                    would suspect I was undermining him...but I was just trying to keep him out of
                    trouble.</p>
                <p>For example, he wanted another secretary to handle his private affairs. Well you
                    can't have a government secretary in the Foreign Service following his insurance
                    policies, writing his checks, and handling his personal affairs. I had to find a
                    way of getting around that.</p>
                <p>Also he never entertained, just as in South Dakota, I guess. He had a large,
                    lovely embassy residence (which those idiots in FBO are now going to tear down
                    and put up apartments). Holdridge would entertain there probably five nights a
                    week and sometimes breakfast as well. And the Embassy residence was a sort of
                    center of activity for the American community, much of the business community.
                    It was always there for the Singaporeans as well. Kneip simply closed it off. He
                    had six of his eight children with him. They moved in and spent every night
                    apparently watching movies, I don't know. He just never entertained. I had to do
                    all of the entertaining. Fortunately we had a lovely house there as well, with a
                    separate suite so anyone who came from Washington to Singapore would always stay
                    with me. I was in the strange position of running the Embassy more or less
                    behind Kneip's back.</p>
                <p>I remember the day when Billy Graham, the evangelist, came to Singapore. He asked
                    for a briefing at the Embassy. Kneip didn't like it, being a Catholic. Graham
                    came to the Embassy and Kneip was quite disgruntled. Graham started asking
                    questions of Kneip and Kneip very sourly said, “Ask him, he knows it all.” I was
                    surprised by Billy Graham, incidentally. He asked very sensible questions. And
                    he said, “What I really want to know about is local sensitivities and what I
                    shouldn't do. What our policies are now. I don't want to get in your way and
                    cause any trouble. I want to make the best impression I can for my cause.” He
                    was much more perceptive than I had expected. Kneip sat there frowning while
                    Graham and I carried on the conversation.</p>
                <p>Time and again, Rajaratnam or one of the people at the Foreign Ministry would get
                    me aside at a cocktail party and say, “Well, what about thus and so?” Kneip was
                    no dummy and he was aware of this. I tried; I think even he tried, but it just
                    didn't work out.</p>
                <p>He also had rather strange working habits. He would come in in the morning and
                    would go home at noon for lunch. Sometimes he would come back in the afternoon
                    and sometime he wouldn't. Part of it, I suppose, was frustration, because he
                    couldn't figure out what to do. He would read the cables, but they were all from
                    places with names like Kathmandu, and he didn't want to admit that he didn't
                    know whether Kathmandu was a city or a country. His pride was being badly pushed
                    around. So finally, he just snapped and bounced me out.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>So I came back to Washington. The State Department was in a state of some
                    embarrassment about the whole thing. They looked around for a job for me and
                    sent me off as Diplomat-in-Residence at Lake Forest College. A very nice little
                    liberal arts college just outside of Chicago where I spent a year.</p>
                <p>While I was there I was brooding about the whole Kneip episode so I wrote an
                    article for the Foreign Service Journal. I used pseudonyms, I called him
                    Ambassador X.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall when it came out. Everybody knew who you were
                        talking about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: I guess I was naive, but I really didn't think they would. I thought
                    some people in State would, and I hoped it would get up to the 7th floor. The
                    article came out in the Journal and the first thing that I knew...whoever covers
                    the State Department beat for one of the networks...George Gedda, I believe, was
                    on the phone to me in Lake Forest. “Ed Ingraham, did you write that article?” I
                    said, “What, what, what article are you talking about?” I should have said, “Of
                    course I didn't write that article.” I didn't deny it quite strongly enough. The
                    next thing I knew it was on the front page of the Chicago Tribune and all over
                    the country. A sort of nine- day wonder. After that, I thought, things being
                    what they are...Dick Holbrooke, the Assistant Secretary, was furious about the
                    whole business because it made him look bad. He was very, very angry indeed at
                    me. Higher up, somebody was on my side—I think it was David Newsom, who was the
                    Under Secretary for Political Affairs at that time. So were a lot of the
                    professionals in the State Department. Officially, the White House was most
                    embarrassed. Without even being told, I realized this was the time to retire. So
                    I came back to Washington after a very pleasant year at Lake Forest, spent the
                    summer on home leave and retired in August 1980.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now we all know not to write articles. It was an excellent
                        article, I might add. That came out when in case someone wants to look at
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>INGRAHAM: It came out in the Foreign Service Journal, the February 1980
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I want to thank you very much.</hi>
