                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, would you want to give us a sense of your
                        early years and education as they might have formed your interest in foreign
                        affairs? I know that you graduated from Brown University in 1950.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes, I did. I graduated from Brown, but Brown was after I'd been in the
                    Marine Corps. When I left school (school was in New England called the Brooks
                    School), I left Brooks School the middle of my last year to go into the Marine
                    Corps and ultimately to Iwo Jima and Guam in a rifle platoon at the time. I was
                    very keen about going into the Marine Corps. My grandfather, who had been a
                    Commandant, the 16th Commandant of the Marine Corps, instilled in me the sense
                    of love of flag and country. So when the war came, I decided, after talking with
                    him, to leave school and I was able to get my diploma although I was not a good
                    student. I needed further education. And then I spent four years in the Marine
                    Corps.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I came back and decided what I'd really like to do is to write. I thought well,
                    I'd like to join a magazine. Time Magazine would be a good idea. I went to see a
                    friend of mina man by the name of C.D. Jackson. He said, “Tony, I can give you a
                    job starting tomorrow.” I couldn't believe it. It was too good to be true! I
                    didn't expect that. And he said, “Yes. See that wastepaper basket over there in
                    the corner?” I looked at it. I didn't see the relevance of this. It didn't hit
                    me right away. And I said “Yes.” He said, “Well, I can hire you tomorrow. And if
                    you empty that wastepaper basket for two years, maybe I might be able to put you
                    into a training program. But if you have that little piece of papeI mean a
                    degree from collegthen I could put you right into a training program.” I said,
                    “Well, thank you very much.” And it's obvious that stuck with me. So, thanks to
                    another friend, Walter Hoving, who was then head of Tiffany, and who was a
                    trustee of Brown University, I then got into Brown University. I graduated from
                    Brown with a BA in English History and English Literature, which was not what I
                    should have taken. I should have taken Political Science. Later, I became a
                    trustee of Brown and am now a trustee emeritus, but I really didn't get my
                    education at Brown. I got my education in the Marine Corps. I got a piece of
                    paper at Brown. It's very, very interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the wartime experience steer you towards a career in
                        foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes and no. I wouldn't say that landing on Blue Beach and Iwo Jima was
                    necessarily a diplomatic experience. But it did lead me in one way, and that is
                    that when I was at Brown, I felt I still would like to write, having sort of put
                    this thought of writing in the backgrounalthough I did end up by writing. I
                    think C.D. Jackson might have been a little bit proud of me. I've written six
                    books, articles, all kinds of other things as a correspondent. But that was not
                    my career. I felt that I would rather like to get into civilian government work.
                    So, I took a look at the Foreign Service and decided that that was probably not
                    what I wanted to do. And I contacted again a friend who gave me good advice, by
                    the name of Bill Donovan. General Donovan was head of the OSS during the war, as
                    we all know, and in 1947 helped to create the CIA as a peacetime agency. It
                    seemed we needed something during peacetime in addition to war. And he gave me
                    the names of two people: Fisher Howe in the old R area, now called INR at State,
                    and another man by the name oI can't remember his name, but anyway he was at the
                    Agency, the head of personnel, I believe. I went to the Agency and had a talk. I
                    then had a talk with Fisher Howe, who introduced me to another man by the name
                    of T. Achilles Polyzoides, who was head of a staff called the special projects
                    staff in the R area in intelligence in the State Department. I took a job there
                    where I was responsible for shuffling through all the hard copy of the desk
                    security agency tapes and sorting it out, writing reports, and then reporting to
                    people like Homer Byington at State on a regular basis. My area was EuropItaly,
                    Spain, France. So I did that for two years. Then a good friend of mine by the
                    name of James A. Cunningham, Jr., who I met at Brown because he was the Dean of
                    the Graduate School. I don't think that took up a great deal of his time. What
                    he really was involved in was as the placement officer for Brown University. He
                    was also a Marine and we met in Brazil. When I came back from General Donovan's,
                    having sent me down to Washington, I said to him, “You know, I just had a
                    meeting at the CIA and they look like a pretty good organization.” I think
                    there's a future there.” You know, he'd never even heard of it. A lot of people
                    then thought the CIO and the CIA were the same thing and what were they? So he
                    promptly went down there, and they offered him a job to head up recruiting. So,
                    back to 1952, when I was still with the Special Policy Staff, Jim and I had
                    lunch one day and he asked me, “Are you happy in your job? How's it going?” I
                    said, “Well, it's not something I want to stay with forever.” He said, “Why
                    don't you come work with me?” And so I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I transferred up to the Agency and Jim had a number of recruiters who stayed in
                    Washington as well as about four or five, as I remember it, who were in posts
                    around the country, such as San Francisco. He made me a roving recruiter. And
                    that was really quite a fun job. I went to Monterey and shuffled through all of
                    their files to try to find a red-headed Finn who spoke Russian, and things like
                    that. And I went to the Menninger Clinic because the Agency wanted to hire two
                    or three psychiatrists. I interviewed probably nearer to two hundred than a
                    hundred. This was really fun training for psychiatry, in one way, because it was
                    absolutely ludicrous. I learned more about their self-analysis, which put me off
                    psychiatry for life. But also, I remember one time in Baltimore, when I was
                    interviewing a psychiatrist, I was sitting at his desk and he was lying down on
                    a naugahide brown sofa. Anyway, I think I ended up giving him a pretty good desk
                    and we were able to fill that requirement. I did that for two or three years and
                    then Jim left his job as head of recruiting in the Agency because he came to the
                    attention of a man by the name of Richard M. Bissell. Dick Bissell, who had just
                    been assigned the job by Allen Dulles to take on a special extremely, extremely
                    covert U-2 project. And Jim went over to that. I just lost track of him,
                    although we saw each other once in a while. Until after another year or so, Jim
                    and I had another luncwe seemed to only think when we were eating. It happened
                    in Washington and elsewhere. He said, “You know, would you like to make a change
                    again?” He said, “Dick took me on as his special assistant and made me head of
                    all the administration for the program. We'll be moving from the little sita
                    small two-story building (which doesn't exist anymore now) on Virginia Avenue to
                    much larger quarter5000 square feeacross from the Metropolitan Club. Would you
                    consideI've recommended yothat you be a special assistant?” So, I said yes. Then
                    I had probably had three years of the most interesting work. Although I had a
                    lot of interesting times at the Department as ambassador, I really had a
                    marvelous time doing this program.</p>
                <p>First of all, it was extremely interesting working on the technical aspects. I
                    don't know whether it was that or what. It turned out to make me quite a techie.
                    Now in 1998, my technology interests, my working on computers, have helped to
                    give me a jump. When I came back from being ambassador in 1977 from Kenya, I got
                    in 1979 an Apple 64K computer. There wasn't even anybody who could tell you how
                    to run the thing. Unbelievable. But I mastered that and I did it for more than
                    one reason. I, first of all, wanted to learn about the computer myself, but also
                    I believed that, as of my business theand a great part of my life has been
                    financeif I understood the language of the computer, what one was talking about,
                    whether bands or RAM or ROM or whatever, I would understand how one company
                    might be better than another to invest in. So, I bought that. I don't know
                    whether my techie interest today comes from the technology that I was exposed to
                    back in my days with Dick Bissell in the mid-50s, but I think it certainly gave
                    it a boost working with companies who manufactured the hardware like Hycon and
                    Randall, the big hardware like Wooldridge and also Lockheed, which made the U-2.
                    Dick's assignments to me were quite numerous and quite varied.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Perhaps, of all of the things he gave me to do, the most interesting was to go
                    abroad to obtain from heads of state permission to operate the U-2 from their
                    country. And this really was quite interesting on occasion, such as when I went
                    to Pakistan. I also went to Turkey. I can't think of who was Charg� at the time.
                    Anyway, working with him we obtained permission from the Turks to operate from
                    Adana in southern Turkey, which I then visited two or three times later. But I
                    also did briefings in various places. I went with Dick to Tokyo where we set up
                    an operation which became later very successful and branched off. The one to me
                    which was the most interesting was to get permission from the Pakistanis. I went
                    to Karachi which was still the capital and had an appointment with Mirza, who
                    was then the President. I went to see him and I said (naturally, I did not tell
                    him what we were doing; we didn't do that in the Agency) we had a special plane
                    that had been adapted to obtain air samples of the atmosphere and could we have
                    permission from his country to do this from an airfield somewhere in the
                    northern part of Pakistan? He told me he didn't see any reason why not. As far
                    as he was concerned, I had his approval, but he wanted me to see the Prime
                    Minister and I should not tell the Prime Minister that he had seen me or that he
                    had given his approval.</p>
                <p>So, I went off and through our people there attempted to arrange an appointment
                    to see Suhrawardy, who was the Prime Minister, and was told that he was sick in
                    bed with the flu. Also, they were going to have the Baghdad Pact Meeting shortly
                    and the ministers were already arriving. He would be hosting a party and would
                    probably get up briefly for that, but it would probably be impossible to see
                    him. Nevertheless, they asked for an appointment, and he said he'd see me, so I
                    went around to his home and was shown into his bedroom. He was lying in his bed
                    with a thermometer in his mouth, and I thought this was a hell of a way to meet
                    a Prime Minister. And the room was absolutely frozen; enough to give him a cold
                    and he had phonograph records scattered all over the floor. I had time to look
                    around while I waited for him to take his thermometer out, which he did when a
                    wrist alarm went off. Anyway, I told him my story and he said, “Well, it sounds
                    fine to me. You have my approval. On the other hand, I'd like you to see the
                    Chief of Staff and get his approval, and don't tell him that you've seen
                    me.”</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I, unparenthetically, thought then and in retrospect feel I should have gotten a
                    darn sight better briefing before going out. I think that probably the reason I
                    didn't is that there was absolutely no coordination, no contact between any
                    level except the absolute top level, between State and the Agency. Therefore, to
                    have me go over to State and be briefed on this would have been a little
                    obvious. The Agency had an interest in it, but, nevertheless, I think that
                    somehow, I should have been briefed on the politics of the country. Anyway, true
                    to what he said, that evening he was giving a reception in the garden of his
                    house for the Baghdad Pact. It was a very jazzed up reception. The colors of the
                    National Flag of each of the countries as lights of each of the trees in the
                    garden. And there were probably three or four hundred people there. So I
                    borrowed a tuxedo from the Chief of Station which, fortunately, fit me well
                    enough for the occasion and went to this with him. I don't know what he wore;
                    maybe he borrowed it from somebody else, but anyway we both went because I
                    didn't know what the Chief of Staff looked like. We finally spotted him, but he
                    was talking to the Chinese ambassador. That was hardly the group we wanted to
                    break up. So we waited for a few minutes. The Chief of Staff walked away, and I
                    then followed him. He was a glorious looking man; all dressed up in his white
                    uniform with a full chest of medals, quite a bit taller than I was. He turned
                    when I addressed hithe moment when I starteand unfortunately I had started to
                    talk to him and was getting to the point, and this was the only opportunity I
                    had, all of which was a bad way of doing diplomacy or clandestine work or
                    whatever you want to call it. If I'd been he and been interrupted at a cocktail
                    party, I wouldn't have responded too well to a serious conversation. It's
                    neither the place nor the time, but I hadn't chosen it. I didn't choose it, but
                    I had started it, and I saw that he was absolutely drunk as a lord, so I had to
                    continue. Then he poked his finger into my stomach and said, “You go back and
                    tell your President that we need more tanks.” So I then reported to Suhrawardy
                    exactly what had happened. And he said, “You've done that. Leave him to me.” I
                    said, “No. He said no, and I want to be sure of this. And I would appreciate
                    your making arrangements for an appointment for me in his office.” Well, it did
                    take place the next morning. And he was courteous and agreed we could have a
                    strip up in Lahore that we could use. I don't think he was too happy about
                    seeing me, but nevertheless it was done. It was wrapped up what I considered
                    properly under the circumstances. So, anyway, I hopped on a plane, which we had
                    come down from Europe with some other people on it. We went up to Lahore and
                    looked at the airfield. It really wasn't that adequate. It turned out that we
                    instead used a strip up in Peshawar. But that certainly was one of the more fun
                    incidents.</p>

                        flamboyant character. You must have had a lot to do with the structuring and
                        corporate culture of the CIA as it took off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Well I really did because before... I sort of left out a bit there. But
                    before I worked for Dick, I also had other assignments and so I worked
                    essentially in all parts of the Agency. And I did go down to the farm you were
                    referring to. I went through the course there and other counter-espionage
                    courses. Lot of training. After three years with Dick, I said, rightly or
                    wronglretrospectively I think rightlbecause that meant I was not involved with
                    him in the Bay of Pigs, which as we all know was a total fiascI said to Dick
                    that I would like to get into the covert area. DDPs it was then called; now it
                    is called the DDO. And I would like to get into that, so he asked where I would
                    like to go. What I wanted to do was Africa and for a while was on TDY with the
                    Africa Branch, which was a branch of the NEA (Near East and Africa), which was a
                    division of the Agency. And there were five people there and then they brought a
                    man, Lester Hauck, who had been in Germany, and he only wanted people who had
                    had operational experience abroad in the branch. The fact that I had been to
                    Kenya, the fact that I'd learned Swahili, didn't seem to make any difference.
                    Motivation was not a reason to be employed; field practice, that is operational
                    experience was what was really necessary. But I had gone out (this is going back
                    a few years) in 1954. I had become extremely interested in Africactually at
                    Brown University in a general sense and wrote some papers on it. In 1954, I'd
                    saved up all my leave for the past two years and fled to East Africthat is to
                    Kenya, to Somalia, and to Uganda and Tanganyika, as it was then known, for six
                    weeks. I'd arranged my trip eight months in advance right down to exactly who I
                    was going to see and had a very interesting time. I met General Sir Frank
                    Erskine, who was then head of the British East Africa Forces and I stayed with a
                    man by the name of Lord Portsmouth up in Eldoret in Kenya, who had a large farm
                    (in fact, five farms) up there. I also stayed with Sir Philip Mitchell, who was
                    the retired governor and had gone through the early Mau Mau problemwent through
                    some Mau Mau battles. And this was all self-educational. I wasn't there for the
                    Agency or anybody else. It was for myself because I was interested. It did me an
                    enormous amount of good. When I was posted to Kenya it gave me perspective.
                    Perspective is something you can't tell somebody about. Perspective is something
                    you have to experience. One other thing I did that gave me a good education in
                    being an ambassador, particularly in Kenya, was having had a business in Nigeria
                    for eleven years. Having very much hands-on experience in business gave me an
                    understanding of the problems Americans have in the kind of businesses that
                    exist in Kenya.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes. What one must remember (and I'm sure most Americans probably
                    don't) is that before World War II, there were only two independent countries in
                    AfricLiberia and Ethiopia. And if they even know where they arI'm being
                    sarcastic, but realistic alsI think most people think of Egypt as an independent
                    country since the Pyramids and of South Africa as always independent. That's why
                    there's so much trouble. And now we have more than 50 independent countries.
                    And, of course, they were then the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and South Africa, not
                    independent countries. Anyway, I was curious about it and that's what I wanted
                    to get into, but I never did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave that period, Dick Bissell must have been
                        an incredible person to work for: demanding, brilliant. The U-2, of course,
                        was his glory. At what point did you leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Oh, he was. I was not there when Powers was captured. No. I was there
                    in the early formation of the program there. I was there to see what the result
                    was. By that I mean not ELINT, the electronic intelligence, but mainly the
                    photography we picked up. There was a man by the name of Art Lundahl, who
                    started, organized, developed, ran, categorized all of the photographic tape we
                    have. And then, to my security, but Dick would sometimes send me on briefing
                    missions either to the chief Air Marshall of CINCPAC, the Commander in Chief in
                    the Pacific, in Hawaii or a number of other people. I had to take these large
                    prints, a 2 x3 sheet, the kind of thing you would like to put in your wallet to
                    know where it is! When we went to Japan, I remember I went out a few days before
                    Dick did. He came out with General Lemnitzer and others. I remember staying in
                    the Imperial Hotel. I think it has recently been redone or whatever, but the
                    ceilings were so low you had to bend halfway down to get into the rooms. I
                    remember when I got into my room, I thought, “Where the hell am I going to store
                    these things?!” There was a space above a cabinet or something where I put them.
                    I couldn't walk around the street with them. I couldn't check them. But there
                    was sort of an aspect of security where one was supposed to be so secure that
                    sometimes you have material with you that is unlikyou can secure your mind but
                    you can't secure some material. It's visible, and yet it must be there and
                    alright. Those were uncomfortable moments. It was a wonderful time working with
                    Dick. He was, I thought, a genius. He really was. He was also an eccentric. He
                    had a sense of humor but he never took me really into his private life at
                    all.</p>

                        Desmond Fitzgerald...</hi>

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Des Fitzgerald I knew because he was the partner of a brokerage firm of
                    which I was a partner in New York. But also one name you didn't mention, who I
                    got to know well then, and have known ever since and well, when he came to visit
                    me in Kenya when he was having problems in Washington, was Dick Helms. Dick I've
                    known well and long.</p>
                <p>So, I couldn't go to Africa, which was what I wanted then and eventually did, but
                    not quite yet. In talking to people in the AgencHugh Cunningham, not Cunningha(I
                    can't remember what his first name was), we decided I might go to Ankara. And as
                    things do in life, they got changed slightly, and I went to Istanbul, which was
                    far better and far more interesting and it became very much a part of my life
                    later on in many different ways. I was then sent as a vice consul under official
                    cover to the consulate general in Istanbul where I did work recruiting and
                    spotting and identifying foreign nationals, third country nationalnot Turks, not
                    Americanwho might do some work for us there. I also recruited some Turks. I was
                    there for a year and a half or so and then came back to the United States. I got
                    out of the Agency. There were two reasons for that. One, my mother, who had been
                    married to my father for a number of years, and was divorced from him when I was
                    four, remarried, and was very, very happily married for 20 years to my
                    stepfather (Marshall was his name), whose name I took, since I didn't know my
                    father, had died. And my mother remarried Vincent Astor and he died. So I felt
                    that maybe it was a good idea that I go home. I thought I might be of some help
                    to my mother.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did those years in Istanbul while you were there for a
                        year and a half coincide with particular violence against the Greek
                        community and the exodus of most of the Greeks living there? Or was that a
                        slightly different timeframe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: A lot of that happened before. But of course the Turks are such
                    nationalistic people that they really don't care for anybody except the Turks.
                    It's a little hard to identify sometimes because it depends whom you're talking
                    to. The traditional definition of a Turk is a Seljuk Turk from the center of
                    Asia Minor. A lot of Greeks had left, but there were a great many while I was
                    there. And afterwards, there was another exodus. And, of course, the Jews who
                    came from Portugal were looked down on and the Armenians were looked down on. I
                    remember one time an Armenian whom I knew whose last name was not spelled ian or
                    yan, and therefore who was not clearly identifiable as Armenian, and whose
                    family had changed their name three generations beforehand, had applied for a
                    permit to have a stall at a trade fair in Izmir and was denied it because he was
                    Armenian. There was and is a great deal of discrimination in Turkey. But there
                    was no great Greek problem. There was, of course, the Cyprus problem, but that
                    would be going on through Star Wars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left the Agency at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: I left the Agency and the other reason I came back was that I myself
                    was having marital problems. I didn't get divorced then but I ultimately did get
                    divorced from my first wife, with whom I had two children, two boys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you blame the Foreign Service, in part?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: No, not at all, neither the Agency or the Foreign Service. Anyway, I
                    came back and I got out. I had been a partner in my step-father's firm, Proctor,
                    Henick, and Marshall, for some time. I looked on that and I looked on my
                    brokerage associations in New York as an anchor. No matter where I went, I sort
                    of looked on that as the anchor in New York, not that I couldn't pick up the
                    anchor and go somewhere. But that was my anchor. I then joined another firm. I
                    felt that they were too old-fashioned. It was quite a break for me, leaving my
                    step-father's firm and going into another firm, but I felt that I wanted to do
                    somethinand I was ahead of my time. I wanted to try and establish a development
                    fund for Africa. I was crazy to think of it then. I mean, people are probably
                    crazy to think of it now! And I'm talking about 1960. And this is 35 years
                    later. They thought I was absolutely crazy. So I thought I simply wanted to do
                    that, so I opened up an office on 55th Street in New York and incorporated a
                    company called African Research and Development Company. And this is sort of
                    cutting corners. I formed the African Research and Development Company, ARDC.
                    And I'm going to abbreviate this a bit, not go into too many details. My
                    purpose, and it was not all that crystal clear to me at the time, at all,
                    because working in the government, in the State Department, was not at all the
                    kind of preparation you want to be in business; as a matter of fact it doesn't
                    help you at all, in my opinion; except if you are going to a career in
                    government and establish contacts, associations, knowledge of foreign countries
                    of that sort. And then you go into business after an interesting but
                    compartmentalized career in government. It did not prepare me. So I made some
                    mistakes. One had to do with people. What I wanted to do was hire people who
                    would do what I wanted them to do: to go out and find projects and business in
                    Africa. At that time, except for academicians, there was really nobody who had
                    any business experience in Africa. So, I hired one man who was a real estate man
                    in Washington. I thought he could take a look at some business opportunities in
                    Rhodesia's Northern and Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which, of course,
                    became Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi. So he went out and talked to a lot of people
                    and had a lot of fun. He was cutting corners and wasn't doing what I really
                    wanted him to do. Then I hired another man who was an academic who had studied
                    Africa. At least a little bit of Africa. That didn't work out. Of course,
                    between salaries and travel, that was all very expensive.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>What I really should have done, in retrospect (Retrospect is a wonderful thing.
                    It helps you in the future to look back on your mistakes in the past), is to
                    have hired nobody except a secretary. I should have gone out myself, which I
                    did. I traveled a lot, but I should have gone out much more in depth to these
                    countries, identifying opportunities. I began to see that I didn't want to go to
                    Kenya. That was an area that I loved, but just because I loved it, it was much
                    too delightful living in those days. Kenya was not yet ready for independence. I
                    didn't know when they would become independent. We're talking about 1960. Kenya
                    didn't become independent until 1963. Nigeria seemed to be on the verge of
                    independence. So I took a hard look at Nigeria. I first went to London and saw
                    Commonwealth departments, numerous banks who were doing business there, various
                    corporationI made a great many contacts, some of them, again in retrospect,
                    which I should have followed up on more closely and didn't. I made the contacts
                    and then I jumped off the diving board into the half-full pool rather than
                    making greater use of those contacts which I'd established. So, anyway, I
                    decided finally to do Nigeria. To put my focus on Nigeria and to incorporate a
                    company there. I also decided on two other thingone, that I wanted to honk the
                    horn of what I was trying to do. So the best way I found to do that was to have
                    a supplemento produce a supplemenon Nigeria in the New York Times. I created for
                    that purposand it did a few other thingan advertising company which produced a
                    supplement in the New York Times at the time of independence on October 1, 1960.
                    I financed the entire thing through advertising and lost money. I went to the
                    Nigerian government and said, “I think you should have a one-year progress
                    report in the Herald Tribune (which was cheaper).” They provided me with a
                    certain amount of financing and also I went and got advertising, and because of
                    the two I was able to better than break even on the two of them. But I took a
                    full page on my company in both of them and indicated what my interests were. I
                    probably could have done a better job on that too. Could have been more
                    specific. And I could have thought a bit more of what I wanted to do, but I
                    didn't know.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>I did also feel that if I was to give advice to others on how to do business in
                    Nigeriwhich was the object of ARDC, to act as a consultant and also in Nigeria
                    as a manufacturer's representation, which is what it did dI should have an
                    active participation in an investment in Nigeria. So I started another company
                    called NIDOCO. NIDOCO manufactured food products which were distributed in
                    Nigeria and in neighboring countries, essentially bakery products. That led to
                    managing the largest bakery in Nigeria, Shackleton Bakery, which was owned by
                    Jaja Wachuku, who was Minister of Foreign Affairs and later Minister of
                    Aviation. He and his wife were quite an experience. So was the bakery. From
                    doing that, I felt I had more of a grasp of how to do business or not to do
                    business, or I couldn't do business in Nigeria. And I was able to advise some
                    peoplprobably should have put more emphasis on consulting, but it was a little
                    easier to do the manufacturer's representation. Actually, although we had about
                    two dozen companies that we represented, I would say three quarters of them were
                    American, although none of them, none of the American ones were a major producer
                    of income. The best was a Belgium company that produced yeast, and that was the
                    real money maker because the Nigerians wanted yeast not only to raise their
                    bread, but to make palm oil. And so that was a real money maker, all in all. So,
                    anyway, I spent about ten or eleven years in Nigeria as a commuter from New York
                    and became a Jekyll and Hyde at doing finance and other things here, and
                    following my other interest in New York's Zoological Society. Going out there
                    four to five times a year, I would spend as long as three months at a time. I
                    was saturated with Nigeria. It was certainly an experience. It was very much of
                    a “sleeves rolled up” experience. I mean, all kinds of problems and people and
                    life, but nothing compared to what it is today. The reason I wanted to go there
                    was it was the ninth largest populated country in the world. It seemed to have
                    all the potential of market, leadership. They are exerting a certain amount of
                    leadership now with Liberia and Sierra Leone, but they didn't then and still
                    haven't organized their own economy and certainly not their politics. Sad.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: I was there during Biafra, very much so. I had no security problemI
                    didn't go to eastern Nigeria; I did, but before the Biafra problem. I mean, I
                    got in my car and drove all over the place. When I left Nigeria, I sold my
                    company to my manager, whom I had hired originally at 3000 pounds a year, which
                    was then about $10,000, as an assistant to the manager, who was a Dutchman who
                    later died. I sold my company to a Nigerian, who eventually paid me back, which
                    was remarkable. He paid me out of profits, but he paid me back. With distance
                    and everything else, and the rather negative history Africans have in finance,
                    he was an exception.</p>

                        would lead to Biafra, as it built up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Definitely. I don't know how much you know about Nigeria, but there are
                    240 different tribes and they speak English in order to communicate with the
                    government and business. There are essentially three large tribes: the Ibos,
                    Hausas, and Yorubas. When I first was interested in Nigeria, there were three
                    states. When I was there, a fourth one was established, and now I believe they
                    have 21 or something like that. And, of course, they moved their capital, which
                    in theory is a good idea, but it doesn't always work out. If you move it from
                    Istanbul to Ankara or from Rio to Brasilia, it doesn't always work out, and it
                    has not worked out yet in Nigeria. But, yes you could certainly see it coming.
                    And, except for the access to the sea, you could see problems. You could see the
                    Northern Nigerians seceding. But I think they probably wouldn't because of
                    access to the sea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now in those years it sounds as if your focus was much
                        more trade and development-oriented than extractive and minerals such as,
                        for example, the Maurice Tempelsman operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes. I know Maurice. No, no it wasn't extractive at all. I had people
                    who came and said to me “We had a wonderful Liberian... blah, blah, blah...
                    diamonds.” I stayed away from that. I thought that was not what I wanted to get
                    into. Maybe I would have made a lot of money that way, but I was more interested
                    iI wasn't doing it at the time for that purposbut it certainly gave me an
                    education which I'd not gotten in the Marine Corps and the education I got in
                    the Marine Corps was discipline. Period. I mean I learned a lot of those things,
                    but the education was discipline. Then at Brown, I got a piece of paper which
                    allowed me to get into a job. But then came my own self-education on Africa, on
                    my trip in '54, my sleeves-rolled-up education, although I certainly didn't plan
                    it quite this way, in Nigeria. Then I got more involved in politics because I
                    knew Dick Nixon, and worked with him on the campaign, and got involved with
                    that, and with all the people who were with him in his first try in '68, and
                    moving rather quickly on this, I said that, yes indeed, I would be interested in
                    an embassy. This was what I wanted and what I wanted was Kenya, and I made that
                    very clear. At that point, it took awhile, in fact, it took a bit of time when I
                    was still in government to disassociate myself with my company. I didn't spend
                    any time on it, but on the other hand, I had to sell and so on. So I closed the
                    doors on Nigeria for all intents and purposes, although there was some cleaning
                    up there. Making a very short story out of a long, political story, I was told
                    that because of my Agency background, it would not be a good idea for me to go
                    to Kenya. But if I would serve somewhere else and reestablished as having been
                    an ambassador, that possibly I could go there on the next tour.</p>

                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes, although I did operate under pseudos and cryptonyms and all that
                    nonsense at times, yes. But more than that, it was decided, quite rightly, that
                    in the seeking of the agr�ment it should be stated that I had been in the State
                    Department (I can't remember the exact wording), but that I had had special
                    assignments with the Agency. A little bit wishy-washy, but it was clearly said
                    and clear that I had been working with CIA. And in clear terms, not just
                    intelligence activity or whatever.</p>

                <p>MARSHALL: No. I don't know if he was first, but I think Charlie Whitehouse was
                    probably one of the first. He set up the station in the Congo, now Zaire, now
                    the Congo. I don't know when he became ambassador to Thailand, but I don't think
                    I was first.</p>

                        went forward, what was the feeling in the Department? Did you feel accepted,
                        was there a skepticism? How did it seem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Oh, there was skepticism. There was also skepticism that a person who
                    had been an entrepreneur in Nigeria would be the kind of person the President
                    would want to send out as an ambassador. Yes, and there was a bit of back and
                    forth. Let me go on a bit. It was then suggested that I get in touch with Elliot
                    Richardson and make a lot of other calls. I'd worked with Maurice Stans, I'd
                    worked with Peter Flanagan, so on and so on. Anyway, Mr. Richardson called me
                    from Washington to New York and said, “Tony, we can't work out Kenya. Would you
                    like to accept Uganda?” I said, “No. I won't.” So then he called me again and I
                    said, “Alright. (I had thought it over.) I will.” After that, I didn't get it,
                    but I said I would.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why the reluctance on it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Although it was on the border of Kenya, I didn't think it was an
                    interesting enough post. I got an interesting post alright. Anyway, either he
                    called me or someone else called me and said, “No it wasn't going to work out
                    for Uganda.” After I'd been tolsecurity check and all thathat I was going to
                    Uganda, I told people I was going to Uganda, which I shouldn't have. I should
                    have waited until after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee appearance.
                    Anyway, Susan Mary and Joe Alsop gave a dinner for me down in Washington; he
                    thought I was going to Uganda. Anyway, I was told, no, not Uganda. So which
                    would you like, it wasn't always clear-cut. Would you like Malawi or Madagascar?
                    I said, “To be truthful, I know where they are and I know something about them,
                    but I don't know that much. I'd like to have a briefing from the country
                    director on both.” So I did. That's when I met a person who became a lifelong
                    friend, John McKesson. I got to know him and his wife, and my former wife and I
                    stayed with them when he was ambassador to Gabon and I've seen him here in New
                    York. I got to know John and he briefed me on Malawi, and he also had somebody
                    else brief me on Malawi and Madagascar. Malawi seemed to me sort of a sleepy
                    little place. Madagascar attracted my attention for both its people and its
                    mixed natural life, both the wildlife and the flora and the fauna. It has always
                    interested me and I was and am now very much involved with the Wildlife
                    Conservation Society in New York. But it interested me very much then. So I said
                    yes to that. So, anyway, I packed up and went off to Madagascar with an interest
                    in seeing what I could do for American business. Our former ambassador there,
                    Ambassador King, had been asked by the Malagasy government to organize a cattle
                    project. As President Philibert Tsiranana said, “We have more cattle than
                    people. We have 14 million cattle and six million people. I want more people,
                    and every 12th child can be named after me, and I will give out honors every
                    national day to the women who produce twelve children.” Hardly the formula for
                    the rest of the world.</p>

                <p>MARSHALL: He was fading. His health was fading. He had to go to Europe to get
                    medical attention. He had to go to Paris, France. But also his mental facilities
                    were failing. When I arrived there, I thought it was an absolutely delightful,
                    and it is a terribly interesting country. Having been separated from Africa for
                    at least 50 million yearthat was a figure I used to use, other people use a
                    figure much older than thabut with the flora and the fauna and the people, and
                    the fact that there is no man on Madagascar as there is in East Africa where
                    Richard Leakey and others are digging up bones all the time. A good friend of
                    mine, but that's what they're doing. David King had been asked to start a cattle
                    project, not to start it, but for the United States to see what it could do to
                    help Madagascar in regards to its cattle. And he didn't do anything. I couldn't
                    not do something. First of all, I wanted to do something. I didn't want to just
                    go sit, although maybe sometimes that's what one should do. For people
                    representing our country abroad, maybe sitting is the best policy, but it is
                    neither in my nature, nor did I believe it was the right thing. I thought that
                    by creating closer economic ties we would have better relations between the two
                    countries, and I say that for anywhere. Maybe timing is wrong in some instances,
                    but I believe that's the truth. So I went about trying to find out who and where
                    and how much, and talk to people. So I talked to Malagasy. This is condensing it
                    a lot. I talked to the French, whose agreement on doing the project. My proposal
                    was one-third, one-third, one-third. The Malagasy provide land and whatever, the
                    French have the abattoir, and the Americans have the ranching. Where was I to
                    get the American side? That was the next thing I was faced with. I made contact
                    with some companieAmericabut wasn't able to really find one. I thought of
                    contacting Bob AndersoRobert O. Anderson of Atlantic Richfield, but also, at the
                    time he and may still be, the largest owner of land in America. With cattle. He,
                    after sending somebody out to Madagascar, a man by the name of Sid Goodlow from
                    Roswell, New Mexico representing Bob Anderson's company, the “Dotted A,” decided
                    that we would meet in Paris with the Malagasy and the FrencBob Anderson and Sid
                    Goodlow. I mean, a lot of work went into it. He decided to go ahead with the
                    project. I continually coordinated it in Madagascar. That, in addition to being
                    in contact with all American companies in Madagascar, going to Kenya a number of
                    times (also for other reasons, there was a UNIDO conference that took me there),
                    getting in contact with African regional representatives of American companies
                    who were and are headquartered in Kenya, and talking with them and seeing if
                    they would take a look at Madagascar. Then, we had ship visits, we had
                    CODELs.</p>

                <p>MARSHALL: I don't know whether you'd call it suspicion or jealousy, or just
                    French. I think I'd call it just French. I wouldn't accuse all the French
                    nation, but sometimes the French can be what we would call very French. There
                    were two factors that were working. One was Malagasy politics. The other was the
                    French not liking the Americans succeeding in their area. The Malagasy politics
                    were quite complicated, but there was a man by the name of Andre Resampa.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, the Minister of Interior, closest associate of
                        Tsiranana.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes. He helped him get to be what he was. But then Tsiranana became
                    suspicious of his motives; his actions. He was a likely candidate to take over
                    from Tsiranana but Tsiranana did not want that while he was still alive. There
                    were otherI think more than Tsiranana, who was really failinmuch, much more. At
                    the top of the list was the fact that there were people down the ladder from
                    Tsiranana who were playing politics. They were both egging Tsiranana on to
                    thinking there was going to be a coup and they were planting themselves into a
                    proper position no matter what might happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does playing politics mean exploiting friction between the
                        highland people and the coastal people? Hadn't there been some riots?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes. There were some riots. There was a Maoist riot in the south of
                    really no consequence. But reportable. I thought I had good relations with
                    Tsiranana. I thought how could I improve? This probably aggravated the French.
                    But it was what I thought should be done. I said I would like to pay a call on
                    Tsiranana's home village. Nobody else had done that. Even the French hadn't
                    thought of it, regrettably. When Tsiranana heard about this, he was absolutely
                    delighted. He said, although he would not be there, I would be a guest of his
                    and his wife's and he would send his half-brother, a non-entity in all other
                    respects, to be with us. He would send him with me, as well as a Protocol
                    officer, in his plane. We went up and I can't remember who else I took with me,
                    and there were speeches, and there was a meal cooked out on the outdoor stove,
                    and toasts, and the whole business. I saw the hospital, the new dentist's chair
                    they had just bought, and it was what should have been a totally successful day.
                    Two days later, I was visiting a non-resident diplomat who was at the Hilton
                    Hotel and we were talking about what had appeared in the paper that day and the
                    day before, and that was that a foreign power was trying to incite a change in
                    government. I said I'd already called several of the other ambassadors and we
                    were trying to get the government to say what they were talking about because
                    otherwise we were all accused. We know the Germans were giving the Socialists
                    money. We're not certainly. While I was talking to him, I got a call from my
                    secretary saying the Foreign Minister wanted to see me right away. So I trotted
                    around and saw him, a man by the name of Jacques Mantasara. He was and is a very
                    nice man. He said, “I have to tell you that you must leave the country.” And I
                    asked why. And he said, “I can't tell you why. I'm just the messenger.” “Well,
                    I'd like to see the President.” “He won't see you. I've already asked.” I said,
                    “You're making a terrible mistake.” He said, “There's some evidence of people in
                    your embassy who have been acting against the government. And the President has
                    been shown evidence of this.” I said, “Can I see the evidence?” “No, you can't.”
                    So I said, “You have the right to do this. But it's all wrong.” And he said,
                    “I'm afraid you must go immediately.” I asked what was “immediate?” And he
                    replied, “What would you like?” “Two weeks.” Word came back that afternoon for
                    me, giving me five days. The next morning, he called me back to the Ministry and
                    simply got out the printed diplomatic list of all the embassies, opened to the
                    U.S. embassy page, and there were little ticks beside five names. He said,
                    “These people also have to go. You haven't done anything wrong, except that
                    you're the captain of the ship and you have to go and these people also have to
                    go.”</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>So anyway, I went back, packed up and left. There was great confusion in
                    Washington about what to do about this. There were many talks about it. I said
                    that I wanted to go back and make farewell calls. So this became a point which
                    we were asking for. They said they would like another ambassador sent and
                    replacements for all of these five that were sent out. We were pretty firm on
                    the issue. Ramanantsoa came to the United States for the UN General Assembly
                    Meeting and he met with Secretary Rogers, but that didn't really get anywhere.
                    Before that, they'd sent a mission which was supposedly to show the evidence,
                    which they did not bring with them. So we really weren't getting anywhere. I met
                    with Ramanantsoa clandestinely. He established the place and the time. So he was
                    doing this really as a friend to tell me there was nothing he could do and that
                    I probably could not come back. Finally, they did agree to my coming bacthis was
                    October, Novembecoming back in February. We said this was out. I was going on to
                    another post. Meanwhile, the whole issue was hanging. I went on to Trinidad and
                    Tobago. I'd gone to see the President. He said, “Tony, what would you like to
                    do? You want to get out, or want another post, or what?” He was just assuming
                    I'd done nothing wrong, although obviously there was a cloud over my name and
                    future. I'd been in CIA, hanky panky with someone or something else? He said,
                    “Well, I don't think Africa...” I said, “No, I don't either, but I would
                    like...” He said they'd been children for their whole history and would be
                    children for 500 more, so don't go there. I was a little shocked at that.</p>
                <p>So I went on to Trinidad and my story of Madagascar really continues to Trinidad
                    because I found out lateand I'd just as soon not reveal hovery precisely, who
                    were the two Malagasy who had brought this forgerwe'll call it that, it's as
                    good a name as anto the attention of Tsiranana. I found out exactly who they
                    were. They were rather high-up people in the President's office. And, what I
                    would call, although I couldn't go to court to prove it, absolute confirmation
                    that the French ambassador was involved both by what he didn't do and by what he
                    did do. What he didn't do was that he took off on holiday for a weewent to the
                    beach in Madagascawhile all this was going on, rather than taking some part.
                    He'd been told by Paris to get this matter settled. Parithe Quai d'Orsay, at
                    leaswas telling him to do something about it, to get it settled somehow. But it
                    was clear that he was taking his orders from Foccarclear to me and clear to
                    others. I then got a copy of the forgery, which was absolute nonsense. An
                    illiterate would not believe it. Absolute, absolute nonsense! Unsigned, pure
                    garbage. And then, finally, almost a year to the day (I was in Trinidad at the
                    time), I got a cable saying that President Tsiranana had held a press
                    conference. I'm glad he held it then because just a few months later he was no
                    longer in office. It said that God had come to him in the middle of the night...

                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Well, the way it played was that, yes, Dave Newsom was in AF then.
                    There was a question of what was going on at the Department, yes indeed. I, as I
                    said, wanted to go back to Madagascar if I could to make my farewell calls and
                    do sort of a clean close on Madagascar. There were certain people in the
                    Department who believed that we should go ahead and send an ambassador out right
                    away. The principal one was the Secretary of StatRogers. He didn't tell me this,
                    but it was quoted to me that we have too many bridges that are being burned and
                    here these people want to reestablish relations and so I want to send out an
                    ambassador. I thought that was entirely wrong.</p>
                <p>Sulzberger wrote a piece in the paper saying that Uncle Sam was having egg thrown
                    in his face. If this was the image, we shouldn't allow a country, any country,
                    to throw egg in our face. Somebody said, “Oh, well, never mind. Go about
                    business as usual.” I had two very strong supporters for my positiomy position
                    being, “Yes, fine. That is, certainly keep relations, but build them up later,
                    send in an ambassador, but let there be a good cooling-off period and,
                    hopefully, in that time we wilwhich we dibegin in a different way and get things
                    straightened out. By that I mean that we were not at fault and we would see the
                    evidence. The two supporters were U. Alexis Johnson, who was Deputy Secretary of
                    State, and Marshall Wright. Marshall Wright was in the White House. Between the
                    two of them that was the position we took. The next ambassador we sent out was
                    Joe Mendenhall, who, in fact, had had a preview of the post because he'd been
                    the inspector at the post while I was there. He gave very good ratings, which
                    was very nice, and he became our next ambassador.</p>

                <p>MARSHALL: I don't know how it would operate now, but it was extremely important,
                    if not essential, at that time because of the Apollo missions. Two things about
                    Apollparenthetical of coursbefore going to Madagascar and when I went to see
                    President Nixon before leaving, I sent a memo to the White House. I don't think
                    it ever got to him. I said, “Mr. President, I understand you are having put
                    together some flags and moon dust and I wonder whether I could take one when I
                    present my credentials? Bus Mosbacher, Chief of Protocol, was present, and so
                    the President asked him to get it done. So I did. I took that out, and during my
                    time in Madagascar we had a unit from COMIDEASRFOR, Admiral Bain, and a third
                    one who had been part of the Apollo mission who were a worldwide tour. They had
                    a visit which was a great success. But getting back to the NASA station, the
                    NASA station got the first fly-past of the first orbit that had taken place, and
                    it also did other things that I was never told about, but I think it was of
                    considerable use. I think probably now it would not be needed. We had one in
                    South Africa, of course, I visited when I was in Madagascar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our other interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Well, we fell into that general Cold War category of interest in
                    protecting traffic of oil from the Middle East, an interest in all of Eastern
                    AfricKenya and, of course, in its own way, Somalia. The tensions in Somalia were
                    to a great degree because of oil. And we wanted to maintain a military presence
                    there, not only in Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, but also in Bahrain, where
                    COMIDEASTFOR was headquartered and Admiral Bain, who did come down from
                    Madagascar, was CINC COMIDEASTFOR. We wanted the ability to have ship visits to
                    show the flag as well as to have shore leave not so much in Madagascar and
                    Kenya.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: I never missed a ship anywhere. I'd say economic interests were
                    minimal. We imported 70 percent of their vanilla supply, but I don't think we'd
                    go to war over their vanilla supply, no matter how important ice cream or may
                    be.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your time Madagascar was still on the French model and
                        French system and there was talk of Tsiranana being attracted by what he
                        called the Israeli model. But then after these events and then Tsiranana's
                        departure, things changed very much towards a less friendly, more leftist,
                        less prosperous in Madagascar.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: When we got there, Madagascar obviously was politically independent.
                    They made it very, very clear that what they wanted was economic independence,
                    which was stupid, if not realistic. Their thinking was they didn't want to be
                    dependent on anybody, they wanted total freedom to decide what they wanted to do
                    in economics as well as politics. What that in real terms meant wathis was after
                    I left, but it was churning as I lefthat they'd broken the French franc, and
                    that was stupid. They kicked the French Army out, which was stupid only in my
                    mind in very practical terms, because the French Army was taking care of
                    defense, while the Malagasy Army were building roads. That's an over
                    simplification. And then they nationalized a number of companies, and, of course
                    the French didn't like it, but they were kicked out of the glorious building at
                    the end of the square which was the residence of the French ambassador. They
                    took away his right to have a plane. And a number of other things. When I was
                    there, I had a plane. I went all over the place. We had an operational mission,
                    an Air Force plane. Somehow or other, where I wanted to go, their operational
                    missions seemed to mesh most of the time.</p>

                        in the time of Eric Williams, the founding father.</hi>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Well, he was the founding father. He had hopes of a greater empire in
                    the form of a commonwealth with Jamaica and Guinea and Ghana. But that didn't
                    work out. I think he was a little frustrated by that. He was a very intelligent
                    man, an historian. He liked to write; he was a thinker. He didn't like the
                    United States. He and I really didn't get on. I couldn't find any rapport with
                    him. And he didn't help me very much to try and find one. I got along well with
                    a number of other ministers fortunately, and extremely well with the Governor,
                    who was Chinese. His name was Ho Tsoy. When I had a problem with the Prime
                    Minister, I was able to go to the Governor. In those days the Governor was the
                    representative of the Queen, who was appointed by the Queen of England, on the
                    recommendation of the Prime Minister. A rather odd arrangement in a
                    constitutional monarchy, I feel, or felt. I have to go back a little bit in the
                    history of Trinidad, to briefly give picture of the way it was and the way it
                    was changing. One has to go back in a very simple way to look at the people who
                    came to Trinidad because the blacks from Africa came to Trinidad as slaves to
                    work in the sugar fields. Then slavery was abolisheyou might say, almost as far
                    as Trinidad was concernebecause a lot of the slaves were kept on on a paid basis
                    but at very menial wages, and indentured servantIndianthen came in, were brought
                    in, to replace the blacks. What happened to Trinidad when I was there, was that
                    it was 40 % Indian, 40% black, and 20% mixeChinese, Carob, White, other races
                    and nationalities. The blacks essentially moved into government and the Indians
                    moved into business. I'm oversimplifying it and being a little cynical about it,
                    but it's what happened. Each eyed the other and the blacks felt, “Well, I'm in
                    power, so why shouldn't I do something to fill my pockets and get into
                    business?” The Indians felt a little threatened by this and therefore wanted to
                    get into politics. All of which was happening when I was there. It happened even
                    more so, I believe, since I left.</p>
                <p>Trinidad could have been much more of a success than it is, than it turned out to
                    be. I really only can comment on my time there with first hand commentary on,
                    but they made quite a lot of money from that oil They had four oil companies who
                    were doing business there. The one I was closest to was Amoco, because they
                    wanted a relationship with the embassy. Texaco felt that they didn't need
                    anything. I got a tour of their plant and that was about it. Tesoro was a little
                    operation down in the southern part of the island which was almost operated like
                    a country club. But Amoco had an official operation that was quite successful.
                    All in all, oil was coming in as an income, as a revenue-bearing industry. And
                    the Trinidadians, to an extent, squandered it, either in the island, or maybe
                    some of it might have gotten into private pockets, private government pockets.
                    And they also gave a lot of their money away to other Caribbean countriea
                    worthwhile cause. But on the other hand, this didn't help them that much. So,
                    that's the way I saw the situation when I arrived.</p>

                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: No, we didn't. That had been closed, just prior to my being there.
                    There was a (I can't remember what they called it.) NAGO, I think it was, or
                    something foolish like that, an instrument finding, directional, navigational
                    aid facility on the island. Very small, and although I had contact with them it
                    was not a major interest. As I had been before when I was in Madagascar, I was
                    interested in trying to help American business. I did get around to all the
                    American businesses but, except for the oil companies, there were companies that
                    bought fabric from North Carolina and elsewhere and brought it into Trinidad and
                    Tobago and set up workshops at low wages and shipped the material, the ready
                    made articles of clothing out. The Trinidadians didn't like that. They felt they
                    were being used which, of course, they were. There was an artificial tooth
                    factory there which seemed to me probably to be a rather unique thing but,
                    nevertheless, they were used to doing the same thinthey found cheap labor to
                    make artificial teeth. Singer Sewing Machine, of course, was there. They were
                    always there and everywhere, all over the world. There were a few companies, but
                    they really didn't need an embassy. In fact, this gets me around to making
                    comments on embassies. I personallI don't know if I said this when I was talking
                    about Madagascar; it didn't apply therit certainly applied in Trinidad and it
                    applied also in a delightful country to which I later became accreditethe
                    Seychelles. So I comment on both of them at the same time, making this
                    observation. And that is that I think it's too bad that we ever gave up
                    legationlegations which were headed by a Foreign Service officer with the rank
                    of Minister. It showed a dignity, an appreciation of the country, a recognition
                    of their needs. But it was not a full grade embassa full grade senior country,
                    or developed country, if you want to put it that way. I think it's too bad we
                    did that. In my way of thinking, which would not have been acceptable, Trinidad
                    only needed a consul general or, if you wish, a consulate general because the
                    main business of Trinidad really was visas, and it was a consular operation, as
                    it was also in Jamaica, where Vincent de Roulet was ambassador the same time I
                    was. He made a big noise about it. Too much of a noise, I'm afraid to say. He
                    was rather derogatory about it. I felt the same way, but I did not raise my
                    voice with the Trinidadian about it because there was no need to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The consular and visa operation you mentioned was
                        basically Trinidadians coming to the U.S. or was it U.S. tourists?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Trinidadians coming to the U.S. In my second year there, I remember 46%
                    of all the applicants for a visitor's visa had to be turned down because they
                    did not qualify. They had no job in Trinidad, no bank account in Trinidad, no
                    reason to go back to Trinidad. But they came up and Brooklyn, New York, was
                    principally their geographic target where they had relatives. And they would
                    come up here and be allowed to live... in the United States. And I'll
                    parenthetically mention here that the visitor's visa is different from the
                    immigration visa which usually took 18 months for an applicant to receive such a
                    visa and that meant that they went through the process of applying to come up
                    here and live. But we didn't want and don't want, and didn't then want
                    foreigners coming to the United States on a visitor's visa and staying. So we
                    ran into, particularly after World War II, we ran into this elimination of
                    legations. I'm not sure whether Switzerland was one of the last countrieit's
                    hardly an underdeveloped countrto have a legation, but we should have stuck with
                    legations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador George Kennan made that same point in a
                        conversation I had a few weeks ago with him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Really?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that we should return to legations, but it's hard
                        when the other countries are at the level of embassies, for us to walk back
                        to legations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: You can't go back and change it. It's hard to take away something
                    you've given, whether it's a wedding ring or a dollar bill. But I think that
                    there is a little example here which I must say I'm not totally informed on, but
                    I'm going to jump to the Seychelles which has nothing to do with Trinidad and
                    Tobago except that I was appointed as non-resident ambassador to the Seychelles
                    when I was ambassador to Kenya. The issue of legations/embassies is relevant, so
                    I'll mention it here. And that is that, after the Seychelles had its
                    independence day, and I had presented my credentials and gone through all the
                    formalities of agr�ment and all that, to the President, James Manchawe did all
                    that. We could have had a resident ambassador. There were resident ambassadors
                    there, but we chose to have a non-resident ambassador, which is half a step
                    down. We had to have an ambassador because it was still during the Cold War. Not
                    only were the British and French there, but the Chinese were coming, the
                    Russians were coming, and we had an Air Force Tracking Station on the
                    Seychelles. We not only wanted to protect that for as long as it was necessary
                    for that to operate, but we also wanted to protect ourselves in the Cold War in
                    the Indian Ocean.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>So, time went by and what has happened? After I left Nairobi, we appointed a
                    full-time resident ambassador to the Seychelles. More time went by. Where were
                    we now? As I understand it, and unless something changed the game, we have no
                    ambassador in the Seychelles, and any questions or administrative or economic
                    information or action is held through Mauritius. We do have an agent in the
                    Seychelles. Well, when I was in Trinidad and Tobago, we had an agent in Tobago,
                    if you want to make these comparisons. I think if a country of 50,000 people,
                    which is what the Seychelles was when I became ambassador, even though they are
                    scattered over 1500 miles across, in the Indian Ocea86 islandthat pure geography
                    is not as important to us now as when we wanted to see oil pass through the Suez
                    and we wanted to have access to the Persian Gulf. I got a little side-tracked
                    there, but having served as ambassador in both countries, I think my drawing the
                    analogy, drawing the comparison, is valid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Returning to Trinidad and Tobago, to finish up on that. In
                        your second year there, I think there was a somewhat controversial election
                        in that many of the other parties boycotted Eric Williams, although I think
                        he was reelected and continued on until he died in '81.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: He was reelected. That was the ongoing process, as I see it, of the
                    conflict between the blacks and the Indians. The haves and have-nots. All of
                    which produces a turmoil in politics and can have an effect on the economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming back to what you said before about Eric Williams,
                        it would seem to me that he would have had so much to gain from an easing of
                        the relationship with the U. S. ambassador in terms of trade and the role
                        and power of the United States in the Caribbean. What was it in his make-up
                        that held him back, as an obstacle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: I really think he was more of an intellectual than a politician. He
                    wrote a number of books which had very good observations on government. And I
                    think he was more of an intellectual, than a practical one. A simple
                    observation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming there from Madagascar, did you see more
                        similarities than differences in terms of new nations in the flush of
                        independence, or was it a completely different Caribbean culture?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: I did know the Caribbean quite well before I got there. I'd been to
                    Tobago in 1954. So I'd been down there. I had visited all of the Caribbean
                    Islands for one reason or another. So, what was there was no surprise to me. It
                    was island living. You can't compare it to Madagascar, the fourth largest island
                    in the world. You can't compare the small island of Trinidad which were tops of
                    mountains to Madagascar. I think thaI'm sort of searching now to answer your
                    questioone might have analyzed them not from the standpoint of their own
                    culture, because their own culture became a lot of what was imposed on them, but
                    rather to have looked at them from the standpoint of whether it was the French
                    or the Dutcand I did not get over to Curacaor the English, who had a colonial
                    influence there. I must say that one of the islands that I thought was the most
                    peaceful and delightful was the little island of Saba, up in the northern part
                    of the Caribbean which was owned by the Netherlands. Part of the Netherlands, I
                    think. But I think you might stretch it and say there was an analogy between the
                    colonial approach and temperament in Africa and the Caribbean in that the
                    British in Africa brought Africa administration and the French brought them
                    culture. I used to think it was an easy simplification, but it's not; it is a
                    very complicated over-simplification. It does have some truth to it though. The
                    French did bring them language. They spoke French and not pidgin English as in
                    Nigeria. I'm skipping around now, but I remember when I first went to Nigeriyou
                    know I was in business there for 10 yearI learned a little pidgin English. There
                    was one pidgin English phrase that I thought was a good example and perfectly
                    ridiculouI had a house therwhen I ordered a light dinner and wanted my steward
                    to go home, I would say, “Bring small chop, then you go for bush.” Well, that is
                    not a very sophisticated way of teaching people how to speak the language. I
                    think the British did allow and even encourage that kind of development, a
                    holding back development, while the French did the opposite. Getting back to the
                    Caribbean, I think the French parts of the Caribbeaparticularly Guadeloupe and
                    Martinique, are quite delightful sophisticated areas, with an emphasis on
                    culture. The culture of Trinidad is, in one word, carnival. Three days a year,
                    they are wild with carnival, with jump-ups, steel bands, floats, drinking and
                    abandoning everything for the carnival life. And the other days of the year are
                    in preparation for carnival. And that is not an over-simplification.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's fascinating. You stayed two years in Trinidad and

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: '74. Yes, I left in January, '74, and arrived in Kenya in '74 in
                    Nairobi. Before leaving, I went to the White House to see President Nixon, who
                    had appointed me originally to Madagascar and then to Trinidad and Tobago, which
                    I think I've already covered, and we had a nice talk. It ended up by his giving
                    me a little farewell, Godspeed message of “Now Tony, don't get kicked out of any
                    more countries.” So, we shook hands, had the usual photo op, and I went on my
                    way to Nairobi, which, I believe I've already said, I knew very well. From 1954
                    when I was there as a private citizen for six weeks, and intermittently on
                    business and safari, and then up to Madagascar, and now I was really getting
                    what I wanted, which all along had been Kenya. Needless to say, I was absolutely
                    delighted. I followed Rob McIlvaine, who was our ambassador there, but who
                    resigned a year before and a charge had been in charge of the embassy for a
                    yeaRalph Lindstrom, an extremely competent Foreign Service officer. Rob stayed
                    in Nairobi and took on a job with the Africa Wildlife Leadership Foundation.
                    Then he moved back to Washington. But he was there for a good deal of the time
                    that I was there. I hasten to add, although that could be a problem, it was not.
                    In fact, I either gave dinners for him or invited him to many dinners. We were
                    on very good terms, and it all worked out. Generally though, in principle, I
                    would disapprove of that. I think it's a bad idea. I also think, I know, it made
                    it difficult for my DCM, who was then chargRalph Lindstrodo some of his work.
                    Not that Rob was interfering, but people would go in and ask him questions
                    because he was there. My coming actually took a load off of Ralph Lindstrom's
                    shoulders because they finally recognized that Rob was no longer ambassador.</p>
                <p>Our first ambassador to Kenya, though, was William AttwooBill Attwoowho was
                    editor of Look Magazine and a writer. He liked very much to write. He wrote
                    before and he wrote after he'd been to Kenya, and he wrote a book called The
                    Reds and the Blacks, which was published as quickly as he could get it onto
                    paper, and into the press when he came back. And this was not at all well
                    received by the Kenyans because he reported conversations which they thought
                    were confidential. And certainly they were not historic, in the sense that what
                    he was saying was still the matter of the moment. I believe, and I think it can
                    be done, the trick is for an author to write about something that is “his in
                    history” and not of the moment. But being a journalist, he thought like one, and
                    he got back and wanted to write a story. The part the Kenyans objected to most
                    was his representative role to Thomas Kanza, the self-appointed middle man and
                    arch rival to President Kasavubu. He, Bill Attwood, and the Kenyans ran into a
                    number of problems where the U.S. was either taking action or saying things that
                    the Kenyans didn't approve of. Kenyatta, though, who at that time was appointed
                    chairman of an OAU (Organization of African Unity) committee to take a look at
                    what was happening in the Congo, which then became Zaire, as you know, and is
                    now Congo again. So when Bill Attwood's successor got there, Glen Ferguson, who
                    is a good friend of mine, he came back and said to me that it was like operating
                    in an iron curtain country. The Kenyans simply didn't want anything to do with
                    the American ambassador, which was most unfortunate indeed. If one wants to look
                    at the area handbook for Kenya, it states that diplomatic ties with Kenya
                    received a setback in 1967 with the publication of The Reds and the Blacks, by
                    previous U.S. ambassador William Attwood.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>So, he wasn't entirely forgotten by the time I got there, but what I was pressing
                    was not politics, I was pressing business. And they were interested in business.
                    And there was an opportunity for business in Kenya. The proof in the pudding
                    evidently was not in Madagascar. And in Trinidad and Tobago there was really
                    nothing to do. I presented my credentials to Kenyatta on my arrival, along with
                    the Yugoslavian poet and Malawi ambassador down at his state house in Mombasa.
                    Kenyatta, in fact, had several state houses; one in Mombasa, one in Nairobi, one
                    en route to Nakuru, one in Nakuru. He need not necessarily perhaps have had as
                    many. They weren't palaces, but they were very nice buildingall of them. The
                    reason he did this was, he believed he should be out of the capital with the
                    people and he didn't like being in town, although I did occasionally see him at
                    the State House in Nairobi. The first matter of business was when I paid my
                    calls on the diplomats, my colleagues, the high commissioners, and the
                    ambassadors.</p>
                <p>There were 74 countries accredited to Kenya at the time. Ambassadors such as Sir
                    Tony Duff later left Kenya to become head of MI-6. He was replaced by Stanley
                    Finland. There was Hamid Ganane, who represented Pakistan and became a very good
                    friend. I told him that one of my deep desires was to visit the province of
                    Spaor the country of Spat reallin northern Pakistan. He said he could arrange it
                    and I always wished that I could have somehow talked myself into giving myself
                    two weeks pure pleasure, but I felt I really couldn't leave Kenya for something
                    like that, but I really wish I had gone. There was Rudolph Resse, a Norwegian,
                    who was an admiral and who was really receiving a post that was below his
                    capabilities and his rank, but doing so because of his health. He was extremely
                    competent and a terribly nice man. He and I had a very strong interest in common
                    and that was the land and development of Kenya. He and his country, through him,
                    was building roads and developing the water and the shores for fishing of Lake
                    Rudolph and Lake Turkana and other water and road projects, as we were doing in
                    part but I hoped we'd be doing more of. I knew the Iranian ambassador quite
                    well, but that was mostly just a pleasure. He always brought a pound of caviar
                    when he came to play backgammon with me. The Belgian ambassador I found
                    extremely nice. He was very helpful to me because we could not, at that time, go
                    to Uganda because Uganda was under Amin. He not only went there himself but had
                    very good contacts there with missionaries and others. And every time he went
                    there and came back, I'd meet with him and get considerably good information.
                    Not just information, but good intelligence. And I became as friendly as I could
                    during the cold war with the Soviet ambassador, Boris Geroshinknov. We talked
                    about UNEP, which he was interested in, and which I was then accredited to as a
                    permanent representative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was by then already headquartered in Nairobi?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes, the United Nations Environment Program. It was just becoming
                    established then. I presented my credentials to Maurice Strong, who was the head
                    of the conference center. UNEF then moved outside of Nairobi. Maurice Strong
                    turned his position over to Dr. Mustafa Tolba, an Egyptian, who then operated
                    from outside Nairobi. And we, the United States, then appointed a full-time
                    permanent representative. I gave my job up to him, and we were represented
                    directly by one person, who is responsible to the ambassador, but accredited to
                    the UNEP. I made contacts with people whom I knew well in the past, with whom I
                    wanted to continue to establish contact, for one reason or another. Dr. Mike
                    Wood, who is head of the Africa Medical Research Foundation, on whose board I
                    served since 1960, and which had a flying doctors' service in Kenya, and
                    headquartered at Wilson Airport, and radio contact in those days with 65
                    different clinics throughout Kenya and later expanded its interest in the Sudan
                    in particular. I was on the New York Boarthere were several country boards and
                    their headquarters were in Nairoband I had the highest regard for Mike Wood, and
                    we were great friends. I also continued to see, and had seen a great deal of him
                    over the years when I was in Kenya, Richard Leakey. I knew his father sometime
                    before I knew him, Louis Leakey. Richard was and is a controversial person. I'm
                    not going to go into the present; I'm only going to stick with the past in this
                    report. In those days, I very much valued sounding some problem off on Richard
                    and getting a totally independent, non-diplomatic, non-black KenyaRichard is a
                    Kenyan citizenon-embassy view on some problem. I did this with Richard a number
                    of times. I hate to say this, but he became more and more, maybe even bitter,
                    but certainly more opinionated through the years. A lot of it waI said I wasn't
                    going to talk about it, but I am now reallbecause of some of the experiences he
                    went through, such as losing his kidneys, both of them, and being given one by
                    his brother, Philip, almost dying in the process. And then, somewhat more
                    recently, when his plane crashed and he lost his legs. But in those days, and
                    that's why I'm mentioning it, he was younger, active, lively, ambitious, and had
                    achieved some of the goals which he'd set out to do. I naturally knew his
                    brother, Jonathan, who was an entirely different kind of person, who lived up in
                    Lake Loringo. He grew melons, and milked snakes for their venom, which he sold.
                    But Richard was a true Kenyan. When he was born, a man by the name of Konange,
                    who, when I was there, was the Minister of State in President Kenyatta's office,
                    spat on Richard. For the Kikuyu, that was a great honor. That meant that he was
                    accepted into the Kikuyu tribe. I knew a number of other people there. Tubby
                    Block, who was a colonial, and I saw a great deal of him, although there were a
                    very few colonials who I did see. Actually I stayed away from the colonial
                    group. I spent my time talking with the black Kenyans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The colonial group was associated with certain places,
                        clubs and spots and was an enclave of its own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes, very much. Although I was a member of one club, the Muthaiga Club,
                    which is about as colonial as you can get. There were black Kenyans who were
                    members, but the LOLS (for little old ladies, as they were called), would come
                    in and put their foot up on the stool for their arthritis every day and sit and
                    have tea. It was pretty colonial.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>A very good friend of mine, whom I'd corresponded with a number of times and had
                    met before I got there, was Joe Murumbi, former Vice President of Kenya. He was
                    retired when I got there. He lived very close to where I was. He was a person I
                    could turn to for a completely different kind of reading. He was half Masai and
                    half Goan, but he was a Kenyan citizen, very much so, having been Vice
                    President. He was the kind of intellectual whom I like. I'm not against
                    intellectuals, but having just criticized Eric Williams as an intellectual, I
                    want to make it clear that I like people who have good minds and Joe Murumbi
                    certainly did. When he lived in London as a student there, he would often, he
                    told me, go without any lunch in order to save 10 shillings or five shillings to
                    go buy a book. And he had the most marvelous library; I think about 5,000 books,
                    all on Africa, in his home in Nairobi. He also had an extraordinary stamp
                    collection. He very kindly gave me a rather large sample of them when I left.
                    And a good coin collection. And maps. He had wonderful maps of Africa.</p>
                <p>I then got to know really very well Charles Njonjo, who was the Attorney General,
                    who in those days was the second most powerful man in Kenya; more powerful than
                    the Vice President, because in those days he had absolute authority, which was
                    taken away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Vice President was already Moi, the current
                        President?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes, he was. But Charles ran into problems. They were political
                    problems. He did nothing wrong, in my opinion. But he was charged with high
                    treason. He wasn't put into prison, but his passport was taken away from him. To
                    give you an example of the way things were run in Kenya, one day Charles went to
                    the airport (this was quite a bit later). It was after I'd left, but I'd
                    returned on a visit to see his wife off. His wife was English, and she was going
                    to England. She still had her passport. Kenyatta was at the airport. He said,
                    “What are you doing here? Why aren't you going with your wife?” Charles turned
                    to the President and said, “You took it away from me.” And he said, “Oh, you
                    should have it back.” And the next day he had it back. And that's sort of a
                    strange way for bureaucracy to work. I liked Charles. There were a number of
                    issues which I went to him on or which he called me about. I'll go into some of
                    them in a minute.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>I turned my attention at the same time, naturally, as I was making calls and
                    meeting or catching up with people, to the embassy. The embassy had 41
                    Americans; 83 locals, plus the staffs of USIA, USAID, Peace Corps, which had 208
                    volunteers in the country. I'll stop on the Peace Corps for a minute. A month
                    after I'd been there, my wife and I gave a reception on two consecutive nights
                    for all Peace Corps volunteers; and if they had a friend, they could bring a
                    friend. I felt this was important for them to know they weren't just operating
                    in a vacuum there. In addition to those organizations, the Library of Congress
                    had a small staff there, and the Foreign Agricultural Service and the IESC, the
                    International Executive Service Corps, was headed in Nairobi by a man by the
                    name of General Ryder. I felt very strongly about IESC, which was founded by
                    Frank Pace and David Rockefeller, using retired people. I'm sure that all people
                    who either read the text of what I'm saying or hear me say it know about IESC.
                    IESC sends retired or available executives out into developing countries to help
                    with regards to the management of businesses.</p>
                <p>I then had my meetings with my country teaan absolutely essential group. I didn't
                    make any major changes in the members of the team. What I did was sometimes
                    include people who were not members of the country team in a meeting of the
                    country team on issues that I felt it would be a good idea if they knew about
                    them or got their opinion. A word about Ralph Lindstrom, whom I've already
                    mentioned. As I say, he was extremely well qualified, and we worked very well
                    together during my time there. But I think, and I'm saying this even though some
                    day he might know what I've said even though I've never faced him with it, that
                    he was a little disappointed that a political ambassador was coming. And, if a
                    political appointee was coming to Nairobto over-simplify ithere are two kinds of
                    political appointees sent out as ambassador. One is someone who just wants to
                    play golf and have fun and go to receptions and there's the other, which was me.
                    And that is I wanted to run the embassy. And it's a little hard, and I recognize
                    that, for a career Foreign Service officer to be displacenot replaceby a
                    political appointee even if he's already been to another country or two as
                    ambassador; particularly if he's been charge for a year, by someone who wants to
                    run the embassy, which is what I did do. Also, I know that it hit him rather
                    hard when I left Kenya because there was a change in Administration and Jimmy
                    Carter then became President and I submitted my resignation. But submitting my
                    resignation at that timit wasn't done in January, but was lateI don't remember
                    exactly whebut it wasn't until April that I was tolI got a cabltelling me that I
                    was to be replaced. Ralph, I know, was hoping that I would leave in January of
                    my own volition. I didn't want to for a good reason, and in April I even sent
                    back a cable saying, “Can I stay on active duty until (I can't remember the
                    exact date) about six weeks ahead?” I did. I was two weeks in Nairobi and then
                    went to a chief of missions conference in Abidjan and then back to the States,
                    because if I was on active duty for another six weeks, I would have 20 years of
                    government service and that meant something to me. That was my motivation, but I
                    think it was hard for Ralph Lindstrom to swallow.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes. I'd like to think so. We did work rather well together. After we
                    got adjusted to each other, which didn't take any time, and I'm not just saying
                    this; it's absolutely true, until the time I left, no until January. But from
                    January on, I did note a change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Certainly the relationship you would have had sets the
                        tone for morale in the embassy. A good relationship radiates good morale and
                        a sour one sours the whole operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes. I had a very good staff. The ones who were there the longesthere
                    was an economic officer who then left. There was a man by the name of John Eddy,
                    who was my economic officer. He had I got along absolutelbecause my interest was
                    economicperfectly. He went on to become consul general in Dhahran. And then
                    consul general in Bombay. Two ideal posts. And he's now living in Vermont. I see
                    him now. He's terrific. I had a very good chief of station, I suppose I can say
                    that. Murat Natirboff was very good; he was absolutely outstanding. He became
                    chief of station in Moscow and he also was chief of station in New York at the
                    UN. He and I stayed in touch, as I did with John Eddy. I had a good political
                    officer, a good consular officer; they were all good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the Chief of Station, you had come yourself from
                        higher reaches of the Agency working for Dick Bissell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: We had a perfect understanding. It sounds maybe like I'm honking my
                    horn by saying this, but my reputation for an interest and activity in
                    intelligence affairs was well known to him when I got there. I don't think I
                    said it when I was talking about Madagascar, but Jack Hazy, who was my chief of
                    station there, received a top order from de Gaulle, and had a most extraordinary
                    career in intelligence. They were all outstanding, but Murat was absolutely
                    outstanding. I could also mention Paul Garbler, who was my chief of station in
                    Trinidathat was sad. He had been pushed into a corner, rather than letting him
                    out, while they tried to decide whether he was a mole. He retired somewhere in
                    the West. I don't know whether he got some compensation for having been
                    considered and accused and tainted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would have been in the Angleton years. This was a
                        period of go-go activity for the Agency. Did you, as chief of mission, feel
                        these guys were pushing the envelope, that you had to pull them back a
                        little bit? Were you concerned that something might blow up in your
                        face?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: You bet it was. I was all for it. But they also protected me. They
                    probably would have for anybody, but the PLFP, one of these splinter groups of
                    the PLO, but a radical onI don't say the PLO isn't radicabut the PLFP is even
                    more so, had sent a team down to Kenya and there were some others with them who
                    were going to blow up a plane at the airport with a bazooka or something similar
                    to that. There was a very close watch on them by the Special Branch. The Agency
                    worked very closely with the Special Branch. The Special Branch were able to
                    apprehend them just before they did it. That was one thing. But there were four
                    people who, we knew, were in Nairobi and they wanted to make an example. They
                    wanted to make the noise that terrorists makthey wanted to embarrass Kenya.
                    Sometime later, maybe you remember, a bomb ruined a whole wing of the Norfolk
                    Hotel. This was the same sort of thing. Anyway, it was understood that they
                    wanted to probably kill me. So the chief of station and the embassy's security
                    officer came to me and said, “You should have maximum security.” I said, “What
                    do you think that is?” They said, “Well, we think you should have somebody rid
                    in the front seat of your car with a machine gun and a car following you. Maybe
                    a car preceding you, too.” I said, “No. No way. Absolutely not. That simply
                    draws attention to me and I'm not going to do that.” They said, “What will you
                    accept?” I said, “I'm a damn good shot. I go out and shoot with the Marines at
                    the firing range here. I've always been a good shot. Give me a weapon, and for
                    as long as is necessary, I'll carry it.” So I did, for three months. But I did
                    find it very embarrassing. I was the only one who was embarrassed about it,
                    because no one else knew about it; but to be carrying a weapon with me when I
                    was in black tie, sitting next to some lady at dinner!” The Agency and the chief
                    of station, because of their good relations, all of that might have happened,
                    but if you know what people are talking about, you have a clearer view, and they
                    accepted the way I wanted to do it.</p>

                        Francophone/Anglophone or</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: The British and the Americans always wanted to work together. The
                    French were different. Two days agthis has got nothing to do with ibut two days
                    ago the Duke of Edinburgh was here and we were asked by the British consul
                    general to come for a drink. And he had all kinds of huge receptions, but he
                    only asked about 60 people. I had met him years ago, but by this time when I met
                    His Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh, he said, “You were an ambassador. Are you
                    still?” I said, “No, Your Highness, I was an ambassador” and he said, “To what
                    countries?” I said, “To Kenya and Madagascar, with Trinidad sandwiched in
                    between.” He said, “Oh.” I said, “Yes. I enjoyed Kenya very much; and, of
                    course, the French were in Madagascar.” He roared with laughter.</p>
                <p>Just some few notes about the embassy. We had a groundbreaking ceremony for the
                    new Chancery on the 17th of December, 1976. Funds were approved in '74, and some
                    years later I went into it. Looks great now, at least it looked great when I
                    went into it in the '80s. Has two basements and four floors, and 60,000 square
                    feet, but believe me it was a real pain getting built. The hole kept filling up
                    with water. They put all kinds of things in it to try to take care of that and
                    couldn't. Also, it's at a place where there is no parking, which was too bad. It
                    was a third location that we were offered. Either of the other two would have
                    been infinitely better, but we weren't prepared in Washington to shell out the
                    money.</p>
                <p>I've been honking the horn about business in Madagascar and trying my best in
                    Trinidad. Here was really my opportunity to do something; at least I felt there
                    was. There were 125 American businesses represented there, either in
                    manufacturing or plantations, some small plants, or service facilities, or area
                    representation. Or franchises. And what I really wanted to do was to visit all
                    of them, and I did. I knew all the representatives of American business. And
                    they weren't all Americans. What I did do waand this had not been done
                    beforstart an American businessmen's meeting. There was an American
                    businessmen's club, but that was lunch and a talk every month or six weeks, or
                    whatever. I invited, not aland I selected those I wantethere were about 60 or
                    80; (there were very few left out) of the representatives of American business.
                    There was a Nigerian, there was a Greek, Brits, several different nationalities.
                    But I put it on the basis that it was up to the company who they wanted to have
                    as their representative, not me. And I'm interested in American business. Coca
                    Cola was headed by a Greek, Alexander Paresis, and he was representative for all
                    of Africa. He was a Greek citizen, but it was an American company. I first had
                    one session, and it got to be too big, so I had two sessions on two consecutive
                    nights at 5:15 for drinks, 5:30 you sat down, and at 6:30, I stopped. I remember
                    even stopping Paresis half-way through a talk (he could be a long talker). I
                    said, “I'm sorry. It's 6:30.” I said, “I'm doing this, Alex, so that people can
                    come here and know that they're not going to be here until quarter to seven, or
                    whatever, and they will come again.” I sometimes brought a visitor, a
                    Congressman or whatever, but most of the time we simply talked about problems
                    the companies had: one company's problems, discussing them, help another, taxes,
                    whatever. So that proved to be useful.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>AID: the U.S. aid program in Kenya was twelve million dollars in 1974, for
                    cattle, ranches, water facility, a seed project, and a population program, a
                    family planning program. I had trouble with AID. I approved generally all of the
                    projects they had on the agenda, but I had serious questions on some of the
                    management of it and the distribution of funds and the accountability of funds.
                    The greatest problem I had was with the director of AID. There was an acting
                    director when I arrived. Then a man by the name of Carlos Thomas Nelson arrived.
                    I have to say that he was black because it became an issue. He had been
                    ambassador to Botswana, Swaziland, and Lesotho. They did not have independent
                    ambassadors; there was only one ambassador for all three. My problem with him
                    was that he would not send me copies of any cables received or sent. And I said
                    that he had to. And he said he wouldn't. So we had a small meeting with Ralph
                    Lindstrom, my economic officer, and one or two of his people, and he still said
                    he wouldn't. So I communicated this to Washington, to Sam Adams, who was head of
                    AID for Africa, and who was black. Extremely nice and extremely capable person.
                    And Dan Parker, who was then head of all of AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a very strong letter from the President laying out
                        your supervisory responsibilities for all of these agencies in no uncertain
                        terms?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes. I said I just can't have this. And Sam Adams said to me when I was
                    on consultations back there at one point (I've forgotten if I raised it or if he
                    did.), “Look, Tony, if you want to have him recalled, that's alright with me.
                    And we will recall him.” I was talking to a man, fortunately, who was black and
                    whom I liked. And I said, “Sam, you know, there is a question he's black and
                    there may be repercussions about this.” And I felt this fellow, Nelson, might
                    make thecreate them. Sam said, “Whatever you want to do.” I went back. Carlos
                    Nelson wouldn't meet again. Sam then came out to Nairobi, and the three of sat
                    down, and in front of Sam, I said, “Look, will you change, Carlos?” There was a
                    long silence and he whispered, “Yes.” I said, “Alright, but you are going to
                    have to prove it. I want to see those cables.” It did work alright. I did get
                    the cables. It was an unnecessary thing to have gone through and, as a result of
                    that, we worked well together on what was being done. We did not get to the
                    creative state, to which I was hoping we could have gotten. I had one creative
                    project which did not succeed that I did do, which was a self-help project and I
                    needed some USAID input, which he gave me, unwillingly, but there was a
                    self-help project which I thought could have been very helpful if it had worked
                    out. But I think it was unfortunate. I don't think I would have changed my mind
                    about changing because I think there was a black PAO (public affairs officer)
                    who was rather vocal, and I had had another problem of the suffragan bishop of
                    Washington, Walker, who came out and went back and wrote to The Washington Post
                    that all political ambassadors cared about was having fun and never talked to
                    the locals. And that I didn't pay any attention to this group of clergymen that
                    came out there. In fact, I saw 15 of them. He never came around to see me. And
                    it wasn't a delegation. They were there for a conference. So we had an exchange
                    of letters through The Washington Post. There was enough of black American
                    criticism, and I didn't want to exacerbate it. I wanted to sidestep it, if
                    possible. And so I tried to work things out, rather than letting this possible
                    problem become worse. One little footnote on AID: about a couple of months after
                    I'd gotten there, there was a population conference just outside of Nairobi at
                    the Outspan Hotel in Nyeri. I guess I didn't take time to ask what's our policy
                    on population control or family planning, and nobody briefed me on it or gave me
                    any paper. There was a man by the name of Ravenholt from Washington who came
                    out, who was head of the whole family planning program in AID. I was asked to
                    open the conference. So I got up and said that I felt very strongly that one had
                    to take social conditions and cultural conditions into account in family
                    planning and that you simply couldn't go off and distribute a lot of condoms
                    into the countryside. Well, the truck was waiting outside full of condoms in
                    boxes that they were planning to dump on somebody's doorstep, which is what
                    happened the next day. There was a sort of flutter of emotion when I was through
                    because I was saying just the opposite of what the head of family planning was
                    saying. I still don't agree.</p>
                <p>A word about Seychelles: Seychelles was covered by the embassy until I was
                    accredited as non-resident ambassador for reporting purposes. I think I'll just
                    skip that for a moment and come back to it, when I did present my
                    credentials.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>There were a number of problems in Kenya, as there are in any country one has to
                    deal with. One was the Saul Miller Ruby Mine case. Saul and Miller, American
                    citizens, came in and received a permit from Kenya to go off into Tsavo Park (a
                    particular corner of it that is well documented) and to dig for rubies, which
                    they began finding. But that was the problem. They then were going to be
                    arrested for not having a permit, because all the papers were lost and one could
                    not find them. It became a scandal. A lot of reporters descended on Nairobi
                    specifically to find out about it and interviewed me. I maybe should have left
                    it to the PAO to comment on it, but I didn't. I became involved. I involved
                    myself. I thought it was important enough in our relations with the Kenyans to
                    get this solved. Washington was saying, if it can't be resolved, we were going
                    to cut off aid and such things as that. And I thought I wanted to do it myself.
                    It was a long story. It went over a six-month period of time, all in all.
                    Newsweek, The London Times, The Washington Post and a number of others came in.
                    Ordway, I think it was, of The Washington Post, came in and he was going to have
                    a story to break. He came to see me when I was giving a dinner one night for the
                    Indian High Commissioner. It was about 10:30 at night, and he said, “I've sent
                    my story in. It's going to break tomorrow.” He said he'd like to stay around a
                    couple more weeks and see what happens. I said, “Get out. Maybe nothing would
                    happen, but you don't want to even take a chance of being put in jail. And that
                    could well happen.” He left the next morning.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>There were a lot of rumors as to what happened. Certainly, some Kenyanand I can't
                    state who they were, although I'm pretty cleahad a personal interest in the mine
                    and wanted to get it. Saul left, and Miller was left in Kenya. He was going to
                    be arrested if he didn't leave. I had him come in and give himself up. They took
                    his passport away and then kicked him out. Strangely enough, not too much
                    longer, but a bit later, the lost file was found. At the same time, a legal
                    process was pursued by which the mine was declared invalid for prospecting. I
                    think that I hearand I'm not sure of this, but considerably after I left
                    therthat Saul and Miller somehow tried to get back there and do something, or
                    somebody else. I don't know. I'm only reporting on my time there. But that was
                    quite a problem. I also heard through the chief of station that there was a
                    counterfeiting ring operating in Nairobi, and one day I got a call from Charles
                    Njonjo, the Attorney General, who said, “I have a young girl by the name of
                    Laura Wood who is being detained and she will serve seven years in jail if it
                    goes to court for counterfeiting.” I said I'd like to see her. He said that was
                    a little unusual. I said, “Well, have a guard bring her to my office.” He did. I
                    asked the guard to leave us alone, and I asked her what was this all about?
                    Evidently, there was a ring and she was part of it. She was guilty. There were
                    Union Bank of Switzerland false notes that were total forgeries that were
                    printed, which the ring would get these young girls and maybe young boys to get
                    exchanged in camera shops or whatever. Anyway, she got caught. The Attorney
                    General said, “If she will tell us all, maybe we can be lenient.” To make a
                    relatively long story short, I did persuade her to tell all, and she went back
                    and told them all she knew, which she hoped would be enough. She was then
                    sentenced to one year in jail and, at that point, her unclnot her mother or
                    fathethey were divorced and her mother couldn't care less about hecame over. He
                    said, “Really, I love this girl and she's run into trouble and what can I do?”
                    So, I got hold of Njonjo again, and to bring the story to an end, she was
                    released. She spent about a month in jail, which was a far cry from seven years.
                    He took her back. He was in the publishing business, and he sent a lot of books
                    and textbooks to the government in appreciation.</p>
                <p>I had innumerable ship visits, which I love. I love ships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would go down to Mombasa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: I went down to Mombasa. They didn't come to me. One of the ones I was
                    on in 1974 was the guided-missile cruiser Chicago. The captain of the ship
                    wanted to stay on shore at night, and I said I'd like to sleep onboard ship, so
                    he gave me his cabin. Just before I went to beI was you might say on American
                    territorthe news came over that President Nixon had resigned. I then went up to
                    Somalia to visit our ambassador, Roger Kirk. I'd been to Somalia in 1954 and
                    found a considerable difference.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>By the end of 1974, the first year I was in Kenya, East Africa was certainly
                    tensing up. Somalia had been invaded by the Soviets, who established airfields
                    on Somalia's mainland, as well as maintaining a base on the Island of Socotra.
                    Ethiopia and Somalia had been engaged in border war since 1964, in their efforts
                    to unite a greater Somalia: British, French, Italian, Ethiopian, the
                    Ogaden...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that concentrated in the Northern Frontier
                        District?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes, in Northern Kenya. Then in 1974, the Somalis were living in
                    Northeastern Kenya, and they revived gorilla warfare against Kenya. And then in
                    Ethiopia after Emperor Selassie was deposed, a military government took charge,
                    which advocated socialism and leaned towards the Soviets. In 1971, Idi Amin
                    overthrew Milton Obote and assumed the presidency of Uganda. He not only created
                    havoc in his own country, and border clashes with Tanzania, but publicly claimed
                    that Uganda's border should be rightfully extended to Lake Naivasha in Kenya,
                    which certainly brought me and President Kenyatta into conversation on the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he feel when we were getting so much deeper into
                        Somalia and the Somalis were disrupting the northern provinces of Kenya? Did
                        that create any frictions for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Not really. No it didn't. I think because we reacted positively to some
                    of his requests. He was very concerned about what they might do. Particularly
                    Amin. I'll get to that in just a minute, but he was also concerned about
                    Somalia, and he had reports that Somalia and Uganda might gang up together in a
                    united clash with Kenya. But before I go into that, beginning in 1975, in
                    February, the Enterprise, the aircraft carrier, came to Kenya. I got a very nice
                    cable from Admiral Oberg inviting me and any four people whom I wished to bring
                    to come aboard and spend the night. This was absolutely great. I make the point
                    here that this is the sort of thing, not only the ship visits in port, but if
                    you can geif it's an aircraft carrier and you can land on ia carrier, it is
                    absolutely wonderful for your relations with your host country. Anyway, I chose
                    Colonel Tedan Kichuru, who was Commander of the Kenyan Air Force, Lieutenant
                    Colonel James Kimaro, Kenyan Navy, and a man by the name of Claudius Wachugwe,
                    who was Under Secretary for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Philip Kitongu,
                    who was Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defense. And that seemed
                    like a good balance -seemed like the obvious balancplus my political officer,
                    Gregory Matson. Gregory Matson, when I was asked to suggest someone who might go
                    to open the office in the Seychelleand I was very pleased that Washington would
                    ask me and not just send somebodand become the charg�, was the person I
                    recommended, and that worked out very well. So, anyway, all of us took off in an
                    aircrafI can't remember what the aircraft was, but an aircraft from Mombasa and
                    had a tailhook landing with the cables on the carrier. And then we were treated
                    to a day show of all kinds of activity and also a nighttime show. I never
                    realizealthough I had been on an aircraft carrier from Hawaii to Guam, there
                    were no planes taking ofthe pyrotechnics that go on when the cables have gone
                    across the deck and the plane lands. It really was spectacular! They also had
                    the F-14s. All the Kenyans were able to sit in the cockpit of an F-14 on the
                    deck and have their picture taken, and that was a great hit. They went up to the
                    bridge and from the bridge we saw an F-14 pass at bridge level at supersonic
                    speed and then they had a rescue at sea with a helicopter demonstration, and it
                    was an enormous hit. And then we got into Mombasa and they took us off the
                    helicopter.</p>
                <p>I had to come back to the United States several times, but '75 was not an
                    altogether good year for me. I came back once because Mancham, who was the Prime
                    Minister and then became President of the Seychelles, was going to be in
                    Washington. So I had to be there to take him to IBRD and EXIM, and we had a
                    meeting with Sam Adams and AID, and the Department of Defense and lunch, and we
                    discussed ship visits and the Peace Corps, and I took him out to see
                    Representative Diggs, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Africa Subcommittee,
                    who visited me in Madagascar, but also visited me in Nairobi when I was
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Charles Diggs? Who subsequently had some
                        difficulties.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Oh, yes. He had some difficulties. He went to prison, yes. Well, he
                    deserved it. Then I went to Memphis because Holiday Inn was planning to put up a
                    Holiday Inn in Kenya. That didn't happen, at least not on my watch. And Kevin
                    Wilson, who was head of Holiday Inn, invited me out there to see what it was all
                    about and go through, which was very interesting, but it didn't turn out as
                    productively as it should have. And that didn't work out. But I saw Holiday
                    Inn's University, where they show people how to run a hotel. Then I went to
                    Chicago and spoke before the Mid-America Committee. It was hosted by the
                    Continental Bank. Then I had a medical exam. The doctors at State saw that I had
                    a little spot on my lung. They sent me off to someone else to take a look at,
                    and I had an independent opinion. They decided that I should have an operation
                    on my lung. I first went back to Kenya and then came back and had the operation.
                    That sort of set me back a little bit; a couple of months, unfortunately.</p>
                <p>I had a number of visitors come out in 1975. My family did; my mother did; one of
                    my sons diPhilip. Did I talk about a man by the name of George Reppas and the
                    cattle project?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about a cattle project.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Right. There were two cattle projects: the one I was interested in and
                    then another with these two Greeks, an American-Greek and a Greek-Greek, in
                    Southern Madagascar in Molitave and they were doing all the wrong things. But
                    this was two years later. I'd been away from Madagascar and then in Trinidad and
                    then come to Kenya. I was in my office one day and my secretary came in to see
                    me and said there was a Mr. Reppas, who was here and would like to see me. I
                    said, “What?!” And George Reppas came in, and I said, “Where were you from?
                    Where have you been?” He said, “I just escaped.” I said, “Well, sit down and
                    tell me about it.” So he told me a bit about it, and I said, “Well, George,
                    who?” (And he admits it. He was just stupid.) My wife was away, but I said,
                    “Come on back to the residence, and let's have lunch.” So he then told me his
                    whole story, which I will abbreviate, and that is that he was put in prison in
                    Madagascar along with his associate, Boucopoulos, and Boucopoulos went berserk
                    in prison. Reppas tried to establish a sort of stability for himself there. He
                    smuggled in sleeping pills. He had a man who was allowed to be in prison with
                    him who waited on him. Cleaned his cell and did his cooking, but then he was
                    taken away from him. The cooking equipment was still thera little open fire.
                    George made a cake, in which he stuffed all the sleeping pills, and he was about
                    to give this to his guard, when a revolution broke out. A shell hit the prison
                    that he was in, so he rushed out of the prison through this hole along with
                    Boucopoulos. But Boucopoulos turned left and was immediately apprehended, but
                    Reppas turned right, and looked up a Malagasy girlfriend, whom he stayed with
                    for a few days. Then he reported in to the embassy. Mind you, I wasn't there.
                    This was another ambassador. He was given a room in the same building where the
                    Marine Guards had their roomtheir headquarters. Then the ambassador told him he
                    would not be able to stay there very long. He'd have to give himself up. So he
                    got hold of his girlfriend (I'm abbreviating this. There's a lot more to it.).
                    He got a hold of his girlfriend and arranged an escape. He somehow or another
                    had some money and he had a car waiting for him and went in the car on a
                    seven-hour drive to Magunga. At one point, a policeman opened fire on him and
                    hit the vehicle, but didn't hurt him. And he finally got to Magunga. He had made
                    previous arrangements there with a man who owned a little sloop. He got hold of
                    the man and said he wanted to be taken to the Comoros. The man hemmed and hawed
                    and, anyway, they agreed on an amount which would be paid when he got to the
                    Comoros (It was a Frenchman.), and they got into the sloop and it had a motor
                    that stalled. They started drifting toward a naval boat, some sort or other, a
                    police boat, but the Frenchman was also an expert diver, so he went over and
                    cleaned out the seaweed that had gotten caught in the propeller, came up, and
                    took him to the Comoros, where he somehow or other arranged for some money to be
                    sent from San Francisco, his home, to the Comoros to pay this man off and got
                    the French to give him enough authority on papenot a passport or anythinto go
                    from there to Nairobi, which is when he walked into my office and wanted a
                    passport. I think that is quite a little story.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Also, in 1975, I was still at the embassy and we received a cable saying that
                    some guests or visitors were coming to Nairobi, and I thought it appropriate to
                    ask them for Thanksgiving lunch, which I did. It was Mrs. Coretta King and two
                    of her children, and an energetic young Congressman by the name of Andrew Young.
                    At the lunch, Mrs. King said, “You will be hearing more about this young man.”
                    We certainly did. And Margaret Kenyatta, I asked, who is the daughter of
                    Kenyatta and also the Mayor of Nairobi, and a man by the name of George Githii
                    who is head of the Nation newspaper. So, during the year I had numerous meetings
                    with Moi, with other ambassadors, with other CODELs, with U.S. business, and
                    with masses of visitors to Nairobi.</p>
                <p>One person who came and is a very good frienwas and iand had been a good friend
                    since my days in the Agency, was Dick Helms. He, at the time, was ambassador to
                    Iran, but he was being recalled to Washington at that time regarding previous
                    testimony in which he was convicted of having perjured himself, for lying to the
                    Senate Foreign Relations Committee about Agency efforts to mount a Chilean
                    military coup. Which all brings me to the obvious comment: “How the hell can you
                    have an Agency, how can you have any organization that runs intelligence and
                    then call them up on the mat and expect them to tell you the truth about
                    something that is supposedly covert and confidential?” That's not the way to run
                    a business. Fine, have a little committee that reports to the Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee, one committee, not seven. He made about 10 trips back. He
                    arrived in Nairobi pale as the proverbial sheelooking green evehe and Cynthia,
                    his wife, and they said, “We need a rest.” He had a bodyguard with him, and he
                    wanted to go out on Safari. The bodyguard said, “Yes, Sir, I'll make the
                    arrangements.” He said, “No. Do whatever you want to do. I want you to stay here
                    in Nairobi. The ambassador is going to make the arrangements for me. I don't
                    even want you to know where I am.” That's what happened. He went out, and he and
                    Cynthia had a wonderful safari. He met wildlife, and he came back looking
                    healthy and refreshed. In fact, he wrote a very nice note in our guest book when
                    they left, saying that they had really had been rejuvenated. He's a wonderful
                    man and I think very highly of him. In any organization, there are differences.
                    Dick Bissell, in his book on his years in the Agency, criticized Dick Helms for
                    not having given him, Dick Bissell, his views on the Bay of Pigs Operation
                    before it went into effect. But then, if you turn the page in his book, you'll
                    then read that Dick Bissell said, “It was not up to him to tell me because if he
                    had, he knows that I would have disagreed with him and not listened to him. It
                    was up to me to ask him and I didn't. I made a mistake. I should have.”</p>
                <p>By the end of 1975, Kenyatta had regained much of his political ground.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes. There was this business about Jan Kariuki, who was a highly
                    regarded individual, a critic of government who all of a sudden disappeared. In
                    fact, he disappeared right in front of the Hilton Hotel along with some other
                    people, and he was later found on the other side of the hill in Ngong Hills,
                    dead, and in pretty bad shape, too. I mean, beaten up. Which brings me to
                    another point about Kenyatta point on Kenyatta. I'm not saying that Kenyatta
                    ordered this to happen. Let me put this in parenthetically, that when you're
                    working for, when you're under someone like Kenyattit doesn't have to be
                    Kenyatta, it can be in this country or anywhere else; it has happened in our
                    country every day probablthe top people under the top people, the top person,
                    tend to want the top person to like what is happening and they do things to
                    please him without his knowing it. They sometimes please themselves more than
                    him. That can even happen as an ambassador. But things are done in your namthe
                    ambassador wants, the ambassador thinkwhich is all wrong, and I'm sure it
                    happens a lot in business. The President wants, the President thinks. So, of
                    course, if you're number one, you're like the captain of the ship or the
                    president of the company. You have tor you shoultake the blame for what is
                    happening under you. Having said all that, what I believe is good, was good then
                    when I was ambassador and is good still for a developing country, is a
                    benevolent dictatorship.</p>
                <p>I am not as solidly sold as some people, including President Nixon, that all the
                    world should have democracy. I don't think that developing countries can jump
                    right into being a democracy. I think they have to go through some painful steps
                    first. I think that one of the processes that can take them more quickly and
                    better through painful steps is a benevolent dictator. I would cite as a prime
                    examplalthough I think that Kenyatta was a benevolent dictatoAtaturk. One might
                    agree with me in including Salazar, although I think he was a candidate for
                    being a benevolent dictator. AtaturI know his history well, and what he dihad
                    people killed, but he brought that country into the modern world. It may be
                    regressing now into fundamentalism, but that's another matter. I do think that
                    Kenyatta was the right person at the right time. I think that whether or how
                    much he may have been responsible for the deaths of Kariuki or for Tom Mboya is
                    questionable. But I think that, as a whole, the management of the country the
                    way he managed it was good and better than now.</p>

                    chronologically, let me move into 1976, which was an extremely active year for
                    Kenya and for me.</p>

                <p>MARSHALL: Yes, he was. I should have mentioned that. You're absolutely right.
                    Well, beginning in 1976, Kenya and Kenyatta reacted to Amin's statement of
                    aggression, which I've mentioned, and this led to President Kenyattwho in Kenya
                    was referred to as Mzee, meaning the old man, literally, but it was a reverent
                    term useMzee led a march in Nairobi and meetings in Nairobi. He was trying to
                    show that he was in command of the country and supporting the people. I'm going
                    to give a few dates through here. In February of '76, Vice President Moi asked
                    me whether the United States would give credits for military purchases. Things
                    were hotting up a bit, as I say, because of Kariuki and a bit of violence and
                    some bombs in Nairobi which didn't seem to bother me very much at the time.</p>
                <p>Q; Those were, though, not externally launched.</p>
                <p>MARSHALL: No, they weren't PFLP or anything like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were rivalries between the Kikuyu old guard and the

                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: No, they were anti-government really. Yes, to a certain degree, they
                    were tribal. In Kenya, the Kikuyu is the dominant tribe, although that is not
                    the tribe of Vice President Moi, now President Moi, who is a Kalenjin. He comes
                    from, you might say, the mid-west, up near Lake Marengo. But there are two
                    Kikuyus. There is one that comes from Nyeri and then there is the Kikuyu that
                    come from just outside of Nairobi. And they don't always agree. In fact, they
                    disagree almost as much between each other as they do with the next largest
                    tribe, which is the Luo, or with the other 18 tribes. So, it's a bit tribal.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes. But Double Odingas he was called, had pretty much quieted down. He
                    was making political noises and receiving a little money from China to help him
                    along, but nothing terribly critical.</p>

                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: No. No communists, none at all. And the Russians really had no interest
                    there either. They did in Ethiopia, but not in Nairobi. And in Somalia. Anyway,
                    I gave a considerable number of speeches when I was in Kenya either opening a
                    conference, or a session, or a meeting, or the beginning of something or other
                    or at a school. I gave a bicentennial speech in Nairobi in February, '76, to the
                    Rotary Club and in Mombasa, the second half of my bicentennial speech in March.
                    I made a point in Mombasa, not in Nairobi, doing what I think is very important,
                    if you caand I put a lot of time in iand that is I gave the first five minutes
                    of my speech in Swahili. All of my lessons, and I had two lessons a weereally
                    that one time was almost worth the whole thing because it was really
                    appreciated. I had a Swahili teacher who came from the coast, where the best
                    Swahili is spoken. I drove her up the wall practicing my speech, but it really
                    is important.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: One of the first, I think so, but I'm not entirely sure. I think so.
                    The 25th of April, 1976, was the first meeting of our Secretary of State, Henry
                    A. Kissinger with President Kenyatta at the State House in Nakuru. President
                    Kenyatta asked for an additional amount of 20 million dollars. We had already
                    approved 45 million dollars to purchase a squadron of F-5Es; actually it turned
                    out to be F-5Es and FFs being the two-seater and Es one. They also asked for
                    A-4s, which is an attack aircraft, which the Ministry of Defense wanted, at
                    least head of the Ministry of Defense wanted. Henry Kissinger felt it should be
                    considered. I was against it, because I felt that they should not have an attack
                    aircraft. I think Henry came around to that thinking, too. I felt that if they
                    wanted them to defend themselvethat was the point they were makinagainst
                    neighbors, and that's fine, but why an attack aircraft? Also, at that meeting
                    Henry asked Kenyatta whether he would visit the United States and that was the
                    subject of several follow-up meetings. In principle, he wanted to come to the
                    United States, but he really wasn't well enough and he didn't want to fly, but
                    he didn't give these excuses. He said, “Yes. I will come some day.” But it never
                    happened. In principle, he wanted to.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: I don't really know exactly what they were, but he was not well, and he
                    went to England a number of times for treatment. Anyway, the subject of the
                    F-5Es was a protracted one. Moi was the first one to bring it up with me, as
                    Vice President, when I went to see him one day in the office, which is really
                    quite funny, at least I thought it was funny, because I knew what he was going
                    to talk about before I went. When I went to see him, we chatted about I don't
                    know what, inconsequentials for several minutes and then he said, “Well, Tony,
                    you know we would like to get, we would like to get-” I couldn't stand it. I
                    said, “F-5Es.” He said, “Yes. That's what we want.” I also felt that in giving
                    it away he wouldn't really catch on that I knew it and I don't think he did.
                    Anyway, as I said, that was a subject of considerable conversation. I also
                    pointed out to President Kenyatta that you couldn't just have the planes
                    tomorrow. Who was going to fly them? It would take two years of training in the
                    United States. So we ended up giving them credits to buy the aircraft, which
                    they did. They bought six, while I was there. Then we gave them a grant for the
                    training of the pilots. I saw Kenyatta a great deal. Another time I talked to
                    him about South Africa. Henry Kissinger was interested in going down to South
                    Africa or to Southern Africa, trying to be a catalyst. I don't think he would
                    put it that way, but in trying to be a catalyst in bringing changes to South
                    Africa and bringing South Africa and the rest of Africa together.
                    Parenthetically, I think South Africa will be the leading country in Black
                    Africa within the next one to two generations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is already, no?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: South Africa? Not leading the Black countries. They're not doing what I
                    thought Nigeria could have done. Nigeria has missed the boat. That's what I
                    mean. They're simply the best organized and in better shape than anybody else. I
                    didn't mean that. I meant leading the Black Africans. They're selling to them,
                    they have promise, but they're not the leader. They haven't quite achieved that
                    pinnacle of political capability yet.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>I had a lot of fun on the 14th of June, 1976, mind you it was our bicentennial
                    year. I had an Independence Day celebration at the Hilton Hotel. I got them all
                    interested in it, and they decorated a room like the Wild West, which I wasn't
                    too keen about, but I guess that's an image of America. What I did, though, was
                    I had given these talks, one in Nairobi, one in Mombasa, a relatively straight
                    talk on independence, although I did refer to George Washington and the cherry
                    tree. Then I talked about change. That's what I focused on. I wanted to do
                    something different. At the Hilton, after everybody had had dinner, I got up at
                    the podium and said, “You know, I've given these talks on our independence
                    celebration of 200 years and tonight I'm not going to talk to you about our
                    independence. I'm going to talk to you about your 200th anniversary. And it is
                    now 2163. You arrived herso forth and so oand the whole thing was science
                    fiction and magic. They loved it! Because what I had done was to invite not a
                    lot of Americans, as I also pointed out, because this wasn't for Americans, it
                    was for the Kenyans to understand and share our day with us. I had invited 100
                    Kenyans who had been in America, one way or another, either on a scholarshione
                    was a dentisand I had a menu program printed with the names of all of the people
                    and the reason they were invited, their association with the United States, all
                    100. The whole thing was translated. It was printed in English the next day in
                    the paper, but also printed in Swahili and put in the Swahili paper. It was kind
                    of a pixyish thing I sometimes like to do. And I did it, and it seemed to work.
                    But it was a fantasy.</p>
                <p>Then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld was coming out, and I went to see Kenyatta in
                    preparation for that. On the 17th of June, Rumsfeld was to meet with Kenyatta.
                    On the 16th of June, I met Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld at the airport and
                    brought him into the Intercontinental Hotel. We had a talk. After I talked to
                    him, I went down and I found out that one of the members of his staff was
                    holding a press conference and telling them about the 5-Es and Fs. I blew my
                    lid! I went back and told Secretary Rumsfeld, who was absolutely appalled and
                    took very strict action. I'm not quite sure what he did. This was not his fault,
                    at all. I don't know if it was a PR man or what, but it was somebody else's
                    fault. It was a press conference. That's what he was giving. And the papers
                    would have it the next morning before Kenyatta would meet with Rumsfeld, which
                    was wrong in every way. First of all, Kenyatta did not want this information
                    released so the neighbors would know, at least not at that point. Also, for it
                    to come out in the press before Russia even... I mean... We had a dinner for
                    Rumsfeld that night and I called up Konange, the Secretary of State in the
                    President's office, who was coming to the dinner, and I asked him to meet with
                    me before the dinner. I took him into the library and I said, “This is what's
                    happened.” He turned pale. He said, “This is terrible. I'm not hearing this.” I
                    said, “Yes, you are. I want you to know. I won't say that I've told you, but I
                    want you to know what has happened, when you wake up tomorrow morning, and see
                    what has happened.” Anyway, to this day I don't know if he told him everything
                    or not. I don't think he said anything, but I did want him to know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that because Kenyatta was not somebody who would
                        suffer bad news easily from the messenger and the people around him were
                        scared of him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Oh, terrified! Anyway, the next morning, I later learned that Kenyatta
                    was furious and he thought it was one of his people. He said, “Tell me who this
                    man is and I will have him properly punished.” We walked into the State House in
                    Nairobi; we walked into this large room with a long table and all of Rumsfeld's
                    people were down one side and all of Kenyatta's people were down the other side.
                    I think I was the second one; I think Rumsfeld was next to Kenyatta and then I
                    was next, and icicles were forming on the ceiling. I mean, Kenyatta was frigid.
                    And he said, “I want to welcome you to Nairobi.” No further welcoming words. And
                    then he said, “I think you want to say something,” turning to Rumsfeld. And I
                    interrupted him. I don't know that I'd do it now, but I interrupted Kenyatta. I
                    said (It was a little bit of gall, but it turned out to be the right thing to
                    do.), “Mr. President, I just would like to ask you whether we are going to be
                    going to a smaller meeting after this, whether this is our only meeting?” With
                    that, he got up and said, “We're going to a smaller meeting now.” He hadn't even
                    been thinking of it, of course. So we moved into the other room with just the
                    Secretary of Defense, myself, and a couple of others. The first thing that
                    Rumsfeld said was, “No, this wasn't your fault. This was mine. One of my people
                    did it and he's going to be punished.” Immediately, it got warmer. And then they
                    got down to it and worked it out. But believe me, the lessons: don't let a
                    visitor let the cat out of the bag before the President knows.</p>
                <p>Then Kenyatta, at a different meeting, said to me, “I may have a lot of trouble
                    with Uganda and that fellow.” He never said Uganda; he never said Amin. He said,
                    “That fellow,” and I knew that meant Uganda. “And he may gang up with those
                    people up there,” meaning Somalia. “I would like to know whether the United
                    States will back me up if we have a problem. Would you ask Secretary Kissinger
                    if the United States would do that?” So I sent whatever one dia flasHenry liked
                    flashes. I do, too, but only if the walls of the embassy are coming down, which
                    they seemed to be all the time. I got back to Henry and reported it. I got a
                    cable back saying that, indeed, the United States would cooperate and help
                    Kenya. So, I immediately got into the car and rushed back up to Nakuru and told
                    this to Kenyatta. He said, “I cannot find words to thank him. What does that
                    mean, though?” So I thought, “Can I say nothing? I probably shouldn't. What can
                    I say?” So I gave him what I thought was an innocuous, fair, honest reply, that
                    the United States would not come in with troops, that we would probably help
                    them by taking a stand in the United Nations, and they would certainly have our
                    support in that. But I made it cleano troops. I got home late and, when I got
                    home Schaufele, who was the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs,
                    called me that evening (I've been debating whether to say this to you, but I'm
                    going to.). He said, “Tony, you got a cable today.” I said, “Yes.” He said,
                    “What have you done about it?” I said, “Well, I went off and I've just prepared
                    a report on my having seen the President and I told him what was in the contents
                    of the cable.” He said, “Tony, a word was left out.” I already guessed it, but I
                    couldn't believe it. He said, “Not.” And so, I didn't like that. And then I got
                    a cable the next morning ignoring that from Henry, saying that I should not
                    interpret these cables.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in response to your report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: In response to my report, but not putting on paper the “not.” That was
                    on the telephone. I got another trip in between, but I'm going to skip right now
                    to Henry's second visit, which was on the 23rd of September, when Henry visited
                    Kenyatta again. When he came, I said I'd like a private meeting with him soon. I
                    went to his room at the Intercontinental. I said I was sorry that there was a
                    misunderstanding when you gave me the message that the United States would fully
                    support Kenya, and I reported that to President Kenyatta. Then I received
                    Schaufele's telephone call, in which he said a word had slipped ou“not.” I said
                    in no way was I going to go back to Kenyatta and tell him that. “But I just want
                    to say this to you personally, Mr. Secretary.” And then he saiand this is what I
                    wasn't sure I wanted to put on the tape, but I am. He then said, “It was
                    intentional.” And there's only one interpretation for that. I went down and my
                    good friend, my economic officer, John Eddy, was sitting in the lobby, and I
                    took him aside and I said, “I'm only going to tell you. I'm not going to tell
                    anybody else this. Anybody. But there's only one interpretation. Officially,
                    we're supporting, but if anything happens, he can say that stupid ambassador of
                    ours out there got things all messed up.” I know Henry well. I see him from time
                    to time, but I will not forgive him for doing it. And I don't think I was the
                    only one he did that to, but I just think that's not the way to treat an
                    ambassador. I think the ambassador should have your confidence, and you should
                    have his.</p>
                <p>Anyway, going back a bit, back to July, I went up to Germany because I wanted to
                    see what an F-5E looked like, and I wanted also to get an area briefing from the
                    command in Germany. So I went up there and I stayed with General Robert Huyser
                    in Stuttgart and went over to Ramstein, Germany, where I saw the F-5E and alsit
                    was not on my list to look at but there was one there and I was intrigued by it
                    as I'd never seen one before at that tima C5 and also the Black Light Harrier.
                    Then also, in August, there was another ship visit, the USS Barry, and I had to
                    come down to Mombasa anyway to deliver a message from Henry Kissinger to
                    Kenyatta who was at his State House in Mombasa. That turned out to be quite an
                    interesting tima little different. Kenyatta did not like diplomats, he didn't
                    like high commissioners, and he didn't like ambassadors; and he and I, very
                    fortunately, got on very well. I'd arranged for four of his children to go on
                    the USS Barry and so when I saw him and gave him this messagI think it was on
                    South Afriche said, “Oh, my children had a wonderful time and they're still
                    here.” So he called them and they came in, and they still had their caps on.
                    That was sort of a hit. But then he said it's terrible how sometimes you say
                    something that comes first in your heabut then he had to explain it. He then
                    said, “When are you going back to Nairobi?” I said, “I'll go back after our
                    meetinnow.” Then he said, “Won't you stay for dinner?” I never had heard, never,
                    of him having any ambassador for dinner privately. Then he said, “And then stay
                    on and join me for the dancers,” which is like turning on the television for
                    him. That is what he did every single evening. The first thing that came into my
                    head was, “Mr. President, that's an offer I can't refuse.” I didn't want to
                    quite explain to him who the godfather was after having said that, so I sort of
                    fumbled and mumbled my way out of that. It was an offer I couldn't refuse, so I
                    did stay on and had a delightful evening.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Another time I saw President Kenyatta about the Kenyan ambassador to Washington.
                    Kenyatta was rather annoyed because a man by the name of Kireni had received
                    agr�ment. I told him, I said, “Your ambassador-designate to Washington has
                    received agr�ment and I am delighted.” He said, “Who? Why?” I said, “Kireni. You
                    appointed him.” He said, “No, I didn't. Sometimes people do things I don't know
                    about. And sometimes they do it because they fear me.” I said, “I'm not at all
                    surprised. They have every right to fear you.” He roared with laughter. It
                    turned out that he didn't go. A man by the name of Imboiga went. And he didn't
                    know about it, or if he did, he'd forgotten it. But at the same meeting, I told
                    him I was going on consultation to the U.S. in a few days, and was there
                    anything I could do? Any message? We talked about the arms request again and I
                    said, “In December, we're going to have our national day, and could we have a
                    fly-by of American planes?” I said, “I don't know if that's possible or not, but
                    I'll do everything I can.” He'd also brought this up with Kissinger. I said,
                    “It's a little difficult, but I'll see what we can do.” Then he said, “On the
                    planes, I'd like to have Kenyan markings.” And I said, “Mr. President, I don't
                    advise that because, first of all, no one will believe it. Maybe they won't even
                    see it, but nobody will believe it. And it would be wrong if they did.” And he
                    said, “Well, will you please ask whether that's possible?” I said, “Yes, I will,
                    because you're asking me to. But I want you to know that I'm recommending
                    against it.”</p>
                <p>That very same evening, he said, “Yes, there is something you can do. I would
                    like to send a letter to President Ford.” I said, “What would you like to put in
                    the letter?” He said, “Well, oh, you know. Here. Here's some paper. Go in the
                    other room and write the letter for me.” So I went in the other room. Kongange
                    was looking over my shoulder. He was the only other person present. And I wrote
                    this letter. I could hardly read it myself. At least it's not as bad as my
                    handwriting now, and I took it into him. It was on a yellow scratchpad or
                    whatever or white paper. I said, “Would you like me to read it to you?” So I
                    read it to him. He said, “That's fine.” So two hours later, I had it signed and
                    on my desk. So I took it back to Washington. (This is, I think, a funny story.)
                    I gave it to the country director, and I said, “I don't know whether to send
                    this to the Assistant Secretary or to the White House. He said to send it to the
                    White House. So we sent it to the White House. They sent it back to the desk
                    officer and asked them to prepare a letter. I said, “Give it to me, and I'll
                    prepare it.” So I went to the typewriter and prepared a reply from President
                    Ford to President Kenyatta to my letter. And then I took it back and gave it to
                    him. That, I thought, was fun.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Then Diggs came, and he saw the President, along with Representative Collins and
                    Dr. Challinor. At that time, they talked about the past and American blacks and
                    Kenya. Kenyatta, though, talked to him in a different way than he talked to
                    Henry Kissinger. And he tapped his wrists and said in those days you had to wear
                    bracelets and, around his neck, he made a motion and said you had to wear tags
                    at that time. He said “We were treated like dogs and we were very bitter. But
                    our bitterness gave us strength.” Then, on the 12th of December, Kenyan
                    Independence Day, the Marine Corps had Harriers which they flew by.
                    Unfortunately, they were not able to do it from the Guam, which they sent down
                    from Naples. This is how the government spends its money. So they flew off from
                    the Guam and then down into Mombasa to fly by. What I was hoping they would do,
                    which they would have done but they didn't have enough fuel to fly up and back,
                    was to stop in mid-stadium in the air. I mean, all the people would have dropped
                    out of their seats. But they weren't able to do that. But one thing that was
                    amusing after this event was that the Soviet ambassador broke away from us as we
                    were all going down the stepthe diplomatic sectiohe broke away from his
                    interpreter for a second and came up to me. This was the only time, the whole
                    time we were there, that he spoke to me in perfectly good, simple English, and
                    he said, “That was wonderful! I enjoyed it.”</p>
                <p>I took a number of trips when I was in Kenya. I did take some safari trips, but
                    “safari,” after all, is a word that in Swahili means simply “journey.” If you
                    call someone at the office and talk to the secretary, she says, “He's on
                    safari,” which means he's out on a business trip. I did take some wildlife
                    safaris for a night or two or three, or whatever. Also, I went on a two-day
                    trithe government chartered a planI took members of the embassy up for all the
                    obvious reasons to stop here, there, and there, all was well planned-outo the
                    Northern part of Kenya to Wajir, to Garisa. At Garisa, we saw an irrigation
                    project and the secondary school in Meru.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The first two were in Somali areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes. They were all Somali areas. Then Haresane where Chevron oil had a
                    rig. In Habasway, there was a camel auction. I loved that. I threatened to buy a
                    camel and ride him back to Nairobi. In Wajir, there were all kinds of little
                    thinghandicrafts, etc., so forth. We gave books away and I gave out ten kilos of
                    candy at the school in Wajir. There were some Peace Corps volunteers up there
                    and I went around and saw them, and gave books away, as I said, to the
                    school.</p>
                <p>Then I went back to the States in May for a medical check-up. I went back for
                    just two days on the 19th of June because my friend, Frank Malloy, whom I've
                    spoken about before, had been killed in Lebanon. And I arrived at Dulles just in
                    time to get to Andrews at 4:20 in the afternoon. Then the funeral service.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Then the 27th of June till the first of July, I went to the Seychelles for their
                    independence ceremonies and, getting off the plane with a lot of other diplomats
                    who either were resident in Nairobi or came for the occasion, including the
                    Italian ambassadothe British, German, Frencbut we all went off in some order
                    that had been predetermined and walked down the steps of the plane, and a car
                    was waiting for us there with our flag, and we were introduced to the driver and
                    to our ADC. My idea of an ADC is a Brit, who has polished boots, maybe with
                    spurs, a sword at his side, epaulet, everything spic and span. I was introduced
                    to my ADC, whose name was Jeannine, who was a 16-year old, very buxom,
                    Seychelloise girl! I said, “Get in the back seat with me so you can tell me what
                    we are doing here and what the program is.” She got in and she said, “What
                    should I call you, Mr. Marshall or Your Excellency?” I said, “Please just call
                    me Mr. Marshall.” That would do. She said, “Mr. Marshall, may I open the window,
                    because I get car sick.” Anyway, the whole thing, as I told Mancham, who became
                    President the next day, at the party the night before, “Look, this whole thing
                    is a debutante party.” He appreciated that because he spent thousands of dollars
                    on this party. I'd been to the Seychelles when Governor Allen was there, when we
                    were still only on a reporting basis from Nairobi, and then come the time when
                    Mancham was there. The important thing when Allen was there was to decide which
                    way to pass the port. And I went when Mancham was there, and he had two blondes,
                    one on each side of us, that he picked up at the cosmetics counter at Harrods.
                    It was a little different atmosphere. We all had to sing during dinner. He had a
                    guitar coming in. Anyway, the whole thing was quite amusing. Independence was
                    about five minutes late because he had insisted on reading a poem in French,
                    English, and Creole, which he had written. He had to turn and silence the French
                    horn which was already beginning to boom up for independence.</p>
                <p>Anyway, one or two small items for '76, we had a mini-com meetings which we had
                    had in Madagascar, which I think are a good idea. I don't think you have to wait
                    for the regional Chiefs of Mission conference. I think you can have a mini-con.
                    There were just four of uand Hummel, who later went on to become ambassador to
                    Chinand two others. I think we all found it quite useful, to compare notes about
                    the region. What does your country think of ours? And up and down from that.
                    Then Billy Graham came out there in the summer of '76. I got a good suntan while
                    up in the stands on that. And Lady Bird, whom I'd known before, in fact I had a
                    memorable time once in Washington when I went down with my mother, because
                    Buchanan Park was to be opened in Washington which my mother's foundation put
                    some money inta grant. And Lady Bird Johnson was interested because she was
                    interested in flowers. She was at the opening of the park. She asked us to go
                    back to the White House and have lunch in Lincoln's Press Room. They set up a
                    little card table there for the three of uand to me that, even though I'd been
                    to the White House for dinnerthat is the most memorable time. I think because it
                    was so private. It was wonderful. Anyway, she came out because of the National
                    Geographic Board Meeting that was held out there. I saw quite a bit of her, and
                    we gave a dinner for about 80 people, and had ballroom dances, and all kinds of
                    things for her. So that was nice. In 1977, I was only there until April.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>There was one project that I alluded to, a self-help project that I wanted to get
                    started up, not Lake Berringo. Cimarron and Degours had an area above the gorge,
                    which in rainy weather, which was infrequent, would fill up with water and then
                    flow through the gorge. My ideas was that this is an example of how you can dam
                    up this very narrow gorge and then have a pipe running down from above where the
                    water was stored that, for at least a while, you'd have some water that could be
                    of use, not for irrigation, I don't think, but at least water for camels, and
                    people and goats. Since this was then-Vice President Moi's area, Richard Leakey
                    and I and Ken Mueller, who was head of an agricultural organization here in the
                    United States, and President Moi went up in a plane and took a look at this
                    gorge. This all sounds rather farcical now that I think of it, but it was very
                    serious then. We all hiked up this riverbed and Moi's bodyguard was right in
                    front of me. All of a sudden, I heard this terrible noise, something banging,
                    right in front of me. This bodyguard's gun had fallen on the rock; thank God it
                    wasn't cocked! It could have killed me! Anyway, we all thought it was a good
                    idea, but it never worked out. I thought if we could set this as an example,
                    then on a self-help basis, if we gave money to other regions with a similar
                    geographic situation, we could do it because only 17 percent of all Kenya's land
                    is arable. And if semi-arid land, no matter how small, could be used in addition
                    to wellground watewe could also get water from above. More meetings with
                    Kenyatta and that's a farewell... I think that sort of sums it up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then Kenyatta, if memory serves, died the year after
                        you left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Yes, he did. A year after I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there at the end of an era in Kenya? An

                <p>MARSHALL: Yes, it was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People say that Mama Ngina was a major force behind the

                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: No, I wouldn't describe her that way. I would describe her and Margaret
                    Kenyatta, both his young wife and his sister, as not forces behind the throne; I
                    really wouldn't describe either of them that way, but independently. They werI
                    mean it was all over the paperthey were notoriously in the ivory trade and
                    making a lot of money out of it. Kenyatta himself, I felt, was the most
                    unavaricious head of state in Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Did I mention going down to Lesotho? That made me think of Mobutu. Lesotho had
                    its 10th anniversary of independence while I was in Kenya. I think it was Dave
                    Newsom who was supposed to go down there to represent the U.S., but he had
                    something else he had to do. So I was asked to go down from Nairobi and, anyway,
                    I went down and spent two nights in Pretoria with our ambassador there, and then
                    went to Maseru, Lesotho. Actually, although the ceremony and all that was
                    interesting, and the people I found absolutely fascinating, and the horses
                    really wonderful and the pageantry. But the most interesting thing didn't have
                    anything to do with Lesotho. Mobutu was there. He thought David was going to be
                    there and he asked to see him and was told that he wasn't, but I was. So he
                    asked me to come up to the palace where I was stayinnice housand he asked me
                    whether I spoke French. I said, “Yes I do.” So he said we didn't need a
                    translator. I had met him once before at a Chiefs of Mission meeting in Kinshasa
                    where I thought he seemed terribly arrogant. So I was prepared for that and,
                    think what one may about him and all the horrible things he's done to his
                    country, I liked him for that moment. Just like with a lot of other people, you
                    may like them for a moment even though you may dislike them for a lot of other
                    things. He said, “I'd like to send a message to Secretary Kissinger.” The
                    subject was Southern Rhodesia and personalities and who he was hoping Henry
                    Kissinger would supporone rather than another. He said, “Here's what I'd like
                    you to say,” and then he said, which I thought was very thoughtful of him, “Now
                    let me just repeat it. These are the pointone, two, three.” Fortunately, I got
                    the communications officer at home and out of bed and got him to send off a
                    cable and had an answer for him the next morning. But I rather enjoyed meeting
                    him and seeing what is not an image of him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You certainly have covered Kenya. Winding down, as you
                        said, we have done three hours, do you have any general comments reflecting
                        on your three ambassadorships? Quality of the staff, the career Foreign
                        Service as you saw it? Maybe the direction of Africa, overall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSHALL: Can I comment on that one first?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: Good. Commenting on staff, I had excellent staff at all three posts! No
                    question about it. I've the highest regard for Foreign Service officers, the
                    ones I have known and worked with, and certainly the Agency and, for the most
                    part, all the other agencies. Obviously, as I pointed out, I had problems with
                    AID, but I got support in Washington. It was just an individual. I think it is
                    unfortunate, and nobody can do anything about this at this point, I don't think;
                    but I make the observation. I think it is unfortunate that we've gotten to the
                    stage where an individual's rights are so protected that you can't make a frank
                    statement about their good qualities as well as their bad in a fitness reporan
                    efficiency report (I'm getting the military and the Marine Corps at this point
                    mixed up.). But it really is unfortunate. And you can't talk about their wives
                    because this is invading their privacy. You can't say whether a man drinks too
                    much or nowhether he drinks too mucand that's not good for his job and
                    performance. You have to use all kinds of cues to lead the person who is reading
                    it to understand that there is a problem and leave him guessing. I think that's
                    unfortunate. You can't commend a wife, either. It didn't happen with me, but I
                    heard of a case in Japan where a wife had learned the language; she was doing
                    all kinds of things to benefit the embassy, and the reporting officer could not
                    say that she was such an asset because you were talking about a wife, or a
                    spouse, one way or the other. I think that is unfortunate. That's the comment
                    that comes to mind most readily, because I think it would be healthy for the
                    Foreign Service to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There certainly is a lot of sentiment that way in the
                        Service. On the other hand, the feminist movement is looking the other
                        way</hi>

                <p>MARSHALL: You're not going to be able to do anything about it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Africa has been a focus for you over many years. You've
                        seen it at different periods. You were involved earlier, I think you told
                        me, in a development fund for Africa. What are your reflections about the
                        way it's going? President Clinton is about to go in the next few days on his
                        first African trip to demonstrate U.S. interest. How do you feel as you look
                        back on it as we're on the verge of the 21st Century?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>MARSHALL: I think first of all, overall, Africa is far worse off today than they
                    were at the time of their own independences, which began with the Gold Coast and
                    then Uganda in '54, I thin'56. And most of them in the 60's. Perhaps they were
                    not given the right kind of help and guidance by the British, the French, the
                    Belgians, the Portuguese, the Italians. Somebody said this to me in just the
                    last few dayhow long can the Africans continue to blame the colonial powers for
                    things not going right for them now? I would agree with that comment. The time
                    has come, and is well past, I believe, where they simply have to get a hold of
                    their own management of their own countries. And I think that management,
                    corruption, and mismanagement are the three major problems of Africa. In some
                    parts, population is a problem. I think that misdirection of education and
                    economic developmenthe two togethewhich allow (depending which way you want to
                    look at it) the unemployed to come into the cities, or (looking at it the other
                    way) not keep or provide some incentives for employment throughout the country
                    results in strife in the major cities and that leads to crime. Which certainly
                    happens in Lagos, Nairobi, and many other places. I think that there are some
                    countries that have surprisingly turned the corner; Ghana is in better shape
                    than it ever has been. There are a few others that have. Kenya, which we've been
                    talking about, I wouldn't say it's in worse shape than at the time of
                    independence, but it is heading down from where it was. There is no doubt about
                    that. The reason for that is mismanagement, if you have to use one word and not
                    go into why, but I think it's obvious from what I've been saying what the why
                    is.</p>
                <p>With reference to the new AID effort program for Africa, and President Clinton's
                    trip, I would hope that we wouland if I read it right in reading about the new
                    AID program, we're doing what I had suggested all alonand that is that we get
                    something for our aid. We should geand each country may be a little differenan
                    economic benefit of some sort. I'm not looking for reassurances or for promises,
                    we've gotten those all along, but we should get some beneficial aspect which
                    could be just for the United States, or it could be something more general. It
                    could include Europe. We could do it in partnership with Europe. It's a little
                    bit like when you charge admission for an organization that you're going to go
                    in to visiwhether it's a museum, amusement park, or whatever. If you charge
                    admission, you're going to get more interest in that organization and you're
                    more likely to get a more organized, politer attitude toward it, and people will
                    enjoy more getting out of it what they're going to get, what they're going to
                    see or do. So if there is more of that sense that “we have to give back
                    something in order to get it,” it could lead to economic benefits. We could talk
                    about taxes, property, land, whatever, something we think should be establishea
                    free zone, whatever's best for the country and for our relations with it. We
                    shouldn't be too careful, too sensitivI know I'm trampling on real feet herabout
                    human rights. And that's a dangerous thing to say. I certainly believe we should
                    focus our attention on human rights and should constantly hammer the point home
                    that they must be observed, but when it comes down to the nitty gritty, I don't
                    think we should not be helping somebody or not going into relations with
                    somebody because they have a bad human rights record. I think the two must be
                    considered for their own benefits and separately.</p>

                <p>As for the President's trip, I was a little sorry, and I can't even remember at
                    this point, but I looked at them carefully at the moment and now I've forgotten
                    them, the countries he's going to. I don't say that he should go to Nairobi, I
                    don't say he should go to Lagos (Maybe it would be good if he went to Lagos.). I
                    just felt that, of the countries he's going to, I don't know quite frankly why
                    they've been selected. I hope they weren't selected to come back and state
                    conclusions which had been reached before he went.</p>
