                <p>“Reflections of a Foot Soldier”</p>
                <p>Professor of Industrial Relations Industrial Relations Center University of
                    Minnesota Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455</p>
                <p>My reflections will probably be of a different nature than those of many others
                    represented in this archive. I have not had a career in diplomacy, nor have I
                    been an architect of the labor diplomacy initiatives others have developed.
                    Instead, I speak as one of the (once-) youthful foot-soldiers of the era.</p>
                <p>It is, of course, possible to put a somewhat grander interpretation on some of my
                    activities. After all, the research paper that I wrote during my year with the
                    International Labor Office (1965-6) was one of the two papers that kicked off
                    the World Employment Program, announced by the ILO in 1969. In that endeavor, I
                    was the first person to actually run regressions in analyses in Switzerland for
                    the ILO (others had used regressions in studies for ILO before, but had always
                    used the computing facilities at their home universities). This involved, among
                    other things, writing a detailed memo to the Director-General, estimating the
                    cost savings between having the regressions done by IBM (Suisse) in Zurich or
                    having the “dactylos” in the clerical pool do them by hand! The papers which Jim
                    Ypsilantis (of ILO's Statistical Branch) and I presented at the UN Conference on
                    Long Term Forecasting and Planning (Elsinore, August 1966) were also the first
                    ILO studies to carry the names of the authors—something needed by a young
                    scholar—and not be generically attributed to the Director-General.</p>
                <p>Now, all this is very interesting, especially to me, but doesn't really get close
                    to my “summary evaluation of Us Government programs in the international labor
                    field,” as you put it in your letter of February 27, 1995. Nor am I likely to do
                    a “summary evaluation;” rather, I expect to lay out some of the issues and
                    concerns encountered by those working “in the field.”</p>
                <p>I will begin my narrative with my year (1965-6) in the Economics Branch of the
                    ILO. To understand my two comments which follow, I think a bit of the situation
                    around 1965 should be recalled:</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>First, modern economic research (with extensive quantitative work) was just
                    appearing at the ILO, as my comment about having to justify the use of IBM's
                    services will suggest. This was about to pick up steam as the WEP, with its
                    major research component, moved forward.</p>
                <p>Second, many of the more senior research staff had lived through Nazi and/or
                    Soviet takeovers of their homelands. No matter how misplaced it might have been
                    or how it might change in years to come, the level of support for a strong US
                    stance in Vietnam was substantial among this group.</p>
                <p>This leads into my first comment on what may seem like a minor matter. At the
                    time, US government clearance was required for a US citizen to work for the
                    ILO—not just as a professional, but for my wife as well when she picked up a
                    short-term, part-time slot in the ILO Library. It was said with some derision
                    that we and the Soviets were alone among the more industrialized member states
                    in insisting on vetting our citizens for international employment. Although it
                    seems like a little thing, it certainly gave the US government a bit of a
                    blemish.</p>
                <p>My second comment really pertains to the time after I had left the Office, when
                    the research program of WEP was up and running. For a while, one of the favorite
                    targets of US delegates to the International Labor Conference and in meetings of
                    the Governing Body was research. Certainly, US delegates were right to inveigh
                    against soupy, sugar-coated reports on labor rights in some of the “Workers'
                    Paradises,” but these attacks also focused on some really solid research, often
                    done by reputable scholars brought in on short-term contract. I seem to recall
                    one especially vigorous attack on a study of the need for life-long training,
                    done I think by Vladimir Stoikov (then at Cornell's ILR School). At the time, I
                    thought this was wrong-headed, in part because the better researchers on the
                    staff were on the whole more favorable to the US and its interests in the ILO
                    (especially in keeping the agenda of the International Labor Conference on
                    track) and because the ILO is an appropriate organ for certain labor and human
                    resources research.</p>
                <p>I left the ILO in September 1966 when my contract expired and I was appointed an
                    assistant professor in the Economics Department at Harvard. It was in that
                    context that I had my second contact with “labor diplomacy,” if that's what it
                    was. In the spring of 1967, I was approached by USAID with an eye to
                    participating in its Summer Research Program. Several countries were mentioned,
                    but we settled on Afghanistan, with a project to look at employment and employee
                    compensation in the developing industrial sector. The idea of the SRP was to
                    assist the research side of developing country universities; hence, the research
                    was intended to be collaborative, conducted with a local counterpart.
                    Unfortunately, Kabul University was linguistically balkanized, each department
                    using as its second language the language of the country assisting it. Thus, the
                    economics faculty all spoke German and Dari (two languages I do not speak). In
                    any event, no counterpart was forthcoming.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>USAID provided me with introductions (through the Industry Department of the
                    Ministry of Mines and Industries), vehicles, drivers and interpreters and I
                    conducted a survey of some 30 modern sector industries, ranging from a
                    2,000-employee textile mill at Gulbahar and a cement factory at Ghori to a
                    small, inoperative oil-seed pressing mill near Bost. The results, quite
                    interesting in many respects, appeared in the International Labor Review in
                    1969. This caused a bit of a diplomatic flap because the article was not by an
                    Afghan official, either of the ILO or of the RGA. In spite of this, USAID
                    brought me back to Afghanistan in the summer of 1970 to update the survey. This
                    time I did have a counterpart, M. Na'im, but his research affiliation (if any)
                    was unclear. Thus, the overall effect of SRP over two summers on promotion of
                    research experience by Afghans remained very limited, to my way of thinking.</p>
                <p>In other ways, I found the SRP experience—or rather, my connection with USAID and
                    the way it operated in Afghanistan—to be rather unsettling. it did not seem to
                    me that the US presence in Afghanistan was being used to its fullest in terms of
                    the various things we might want to promote. At the simplest level, it was
                    difficult to maintain the sense of equality probably essential to a counterpart
                    relationship when the counterpart is barred from staying in the USAID Staff
                    House (when available). Coming into Kandahar with the temperature at 130+
                    degrees, I certainly wanted the clean swimming pool and air conditioning of the
                    Staff House. (As a labor economist, and not an anthropologist, I didn't think I
                    needed to stay in the bazaar to “pay my dues.”) I can understand the rules,
                    regulations, etc. that precluded Na'im from staying there—and I think he did
                    too—but it still made the experience a funny one.</p>
                <p>But, more broadly, I thought our US presence was not generating the human
                    resource training and development outcomes that it could and probably should. On
                    my first visit, USAID jobs were very strongly stratified. At the top were
                    Americans, in charge of policy (the finance officer, the transportation
                    officer); next came the Third Country Nationals, mostly Indians, who handled
                    clerical and administrative chores (bookkeepers, cashiers, stores attendants);
                    at the bottom were the Afghans, confined to laborer and driver jobs. In
                    fairness, it should be said that major state (Ariana Afghan Airlines, Radio
                    Kabul) and private (IndAmer Afghan Industries) enterprises were arranged much
                    the same way. I was told that there were at the time about 1200 “official”
                    Americans in Afghanistan (this may have been USAID and Embassy staff combined),
                    so the whole support enterprise was quite large. Yet, it seemed very little
                    effort was being made to recruit, train and upgrade Afghan staff, at least with
                    the object of replacing the TCNs. I thought we were missing a chance to
                    contribute directly to human capital accumulation and, maybe, even to make a few
                    friends. I raised this subject (naturally), and received the usual litany of
                    previous failures, conclusions that Afghans were unstable workers, untrainable,
                    etc. When I returned three years later, it did seem that some changes had been
                    made, and more training was available for bookkeeper and stores attendant
                    positions.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Whether or not these experiences qualify as “labor diplomacy,” I will note that I
                    did have further contact with a USAID-backed project nearly 20 years later. In
                    the springs of 1988 and 1989, I served as a consultant to the National
                    Employment, Manpower and Incomes Commission of Botswana, on a project funded by
                    AID through a contract with the Academy for Educational Development, Inc. My
                    counterpart was an official of the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning,
                    Taufila Nyamadzabo, a University of Delaware MA in Economics. We traveled around
                    the country, discussing minimum wages policy or productivity issues with
                    employers, unions, and other contract. A much more successful model of
                    counterpart relationship was involved in these experiences in Botswana.</p>
                <p>My final contact with “labor diplomacy” was with the USDL's International Visitor
                    Program. During my tenure at the University of Illinois, we had a fair number of
                    such visitors; we had a couple of them at the University of Minnesota after I
                    came here in 1979. I used them in my international/comparative classes, for
                    special workshops, and alerted colleagues in other departments about their
                    availability. These visitors seemed extremely valuable; I was severely
                    disappointed when the IVP was eliminated in the early Reagan years.</p>
                <p>I would say the same about the program in reverse (I think it was called IVP when
                    American scholars were supported overseas, but am not sure). In any event, I was
                    part of this once, in 1979, I think. I was to be in Japan for the Japan
                    Institute of Labor Regional Conference, and was contacted by Joe Glazer of USDL.
                    I was given the chance to speak at a number of business seminars in several
                    Japanese cities, talking about recent developments in industrial relations and
                    economic policy in the US. I found it interesting and believe that I helped my
                    hosts understand a bit more of the US scene. Sixteen years later, will it have
                    helped them understand our current Japan-bashing? I don't know, but I hope
                    so.</p>
                <p>Any “summary evaluation”? I suppose that, if one looks at these activities, they
                    don't compare with efforts to bolster “free trade unionism” in France or Poland
                    (through support of FO and Solidarity) and elsewhere, but they are part of an
                    overall life of international activity which has brought my work to others (many
                    scholars, but also government, business and labor people) around the world. In
                    some sense, consider how the government's money (or in the case of employment at
                    the ILO, approbation) has been “leveraged:”</p>
                <p>My Universities (Illinois and Minnesota) have supported various initiatives,
                    including travel to give papers at most of the IIRA World Congresses and a
                    number of the regional congresses.</p>
                <p>I have served as mentor or instructor to groups of American students in two
                    University of Minnesota programs: Minnesota Studies in International Development
                    (mentor in Varanasi, 1987, and Pune, 1989) and the Minnesota/Lyon III Joint
                    Summer Program in Business (instructor, 1984).</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MUCIA (the Midwest Universities Consortium for International Activities, composed
                    of all but two of the Big Ten universities) supported (financially, for a while)
                    the creation of a Third World Labor Markets Task Force (now a study group of the
                    International Industrial Relations Association), which I have chaired since the
                    mid-1970s. The Study Group currently counts some 80 scholars and government
                    researchers from 27 countries among its membership. Its most recent publication
                    is Status Influences in Third World Labor Markets: Caste, Gender and Custom (de
                    Gruyter: Berlin and New York, 1991), edited and with several chapters by me.</p>
                <p>I was the labor market expert on the ILO's WEP Employment Strategy Mission to
                    Iran in 1971-2, on World Bank Missions to Saudi Arabia and Jordan in the
                    mid-70s, and on a MUCIA team (funded by the African Development Bank) in Mali,
                    1990.</p>
                <p>During the summer of 1972, while in Iran on a University of Illinois research
                    grant, I arranged for a meeting with Minister of Labor Abdol-Majid Majidi (whom
                    I had not been “encouraged” to see during the WEP Mission the previous winter)
                    to express my doubts about the employment balance sheet predicted in the
                    Missions's Report. (I felt that the Report under predicted urban labor force
                    increases and over predicted urban employment increases; civil unrest was among
                    the consequences I foresaw of soaring urban unemployment. This whole story, and
                    the degree to which it comports with subsequent developments, is reported in
                    “The Labor Market in Pre-revolutionary Iran, “Economic Development and Cultural
                    Change, October 1985.) I gave talks based on the same topic at a number of
                    universities and at the USDL's International Manpower Institute in the mid-70s,
                    before the Iranian Revolution.</p>
                <p>I have spoken around the world on a range of labor topics, from a talk to foreign
                    labor statisticians in St. Paul, MN to an address to a Banaras Hindu University
                    conference on social integration in Varanasi, India.</p>
                <p>Not, I think, a bad return on investment.</p>
