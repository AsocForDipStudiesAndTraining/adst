                <p>[Note: This interview was not edited by Mr. Pierce}</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright, why don't we start at the beginning? Can you tell
                        me when and where you were born and something about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I was born March 3, 1944 in Atlanta, Georgia. My father was from
                    Michigan; my mother was from just up the road in Georgia. He was a civilian with
                    the Army Corps of Engineers. My father died in 1949 of a brain tumor and my
                    mother relocated back to Cartersville, her hometown, where I grew up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your mother and father meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: My father was working on a dam for the Corps on the Etowah River, some 40
                    miles north of Atlanta, from the flood. It was near the town my mother came from
                    and that's how they met. This would've been, I think, just before the war. After
                    they were married they moved to Atlanta and that's where he was based.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your father an engineer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did he get his degree?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The University of Michigan. Specializing, as I recall, in hydraulics
                    engineering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your mother; what was her background</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>PIERCE: My mother's father was a lawyer who was born in 1880 in the woods north
                    of West Calc from a rather poor country family that had been there since the
                    Cherokee Indians were kicked out; just after that in the 1800s. He was a very
                    poor boy and was taken by Mopaberry and became Mopaberry's first graduate
                    through school in Plum, Georgia, which was created for country boys in the early
                    1900s, late 1800s or 1890s. He went to the University of Georgia Law School and
                    became a lawyer. My grandmother was from a wealthier family who owned land in
                    and around Georgia and western Northwest Georgia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically at the time you were beginning to be aware of
                        things you were growing uwas it in Carterville?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Cartersville.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Cartersville like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Cartersville is a town that was founded sometime before the War Between
                    the States as a rail head. It was preeminent in the foothills of the Piedmont,
                    the foothills of Northwest Georgia. It was preeminent in mining. There was a lot
                    of farming around it, but it was primarily a mining town. It was, at the time
                    that I grew up, maybe six or seven thousand people. It has since then taken off
                    and become a major textile center. Cartersville is located forty-four miles
                    north of Atlanta. It's a small town; semi-rural city type atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you grow up with your mother and grandparents
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes. My mother firsafter my father dielived for a short time with her
                    parents and was able to rent, and later buy, a house on her own where my brother
                    and I were reared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your mother go into some line of work or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: My mother had one or two years of college and ended up becoming an
                    assistanI guess in today's parlance, an executive assistanfor a small insurance
                    agent. Sold insurance up until she retired, which would've been perhaps 20 years
                    ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>PIERCE: We had a small city system and I grew up in a small city system. At the
                    time the system was segregated and remained segregated until I graduated in 1962
                    and afterwards. It was just a typical Georgia school system. I'm trying to
                    recall the number in my graduating clasperhaps about 88, something like that. I
                    went to Davidson College after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, before you went to college, in high school and
                        grammar school, what were your main interests in school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's kind of hard to think about. Let's see. I read some; I started
                    reading more when I was about 12 or 13 and discovered English as a course of
                    great interest midway through high school. English poetry. That was also about
                    the time I figured out I wasn't very good at math or science.</p>
                <p>On the outside, it was a small town and we did a lot of roaming through the
                    woods. Very, very beautiful mountains, hills, river system; the Etowah River
                    that was dammed by my father. The area was a good site for old Civil War sites,
                    old antebellum houses.</p>
                <p>The Etowah River is named after the Etowah Indians. Near the town there are three
                    Indian mounds that are remnants from the Etowah Indian community, which I
                    believe disappeared perhaps in the sixteenth century. But you can still finor
                    you could at that timartifacts in various areas around the county: arrowheads.
                    More professional people have found immensely interesting artifacts: shards of
                    pottery and indeed shards of bone. It was an interesting place to walk around
                    for a 12-, 13-, 14-year-old kid. My brother did a lot of that with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any Civil War battles in that area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: We were in the path that Sherman took from Chattanooga to Atlanta. The
                    church that I was brought up in was used during the Civil War by Sherman's
                    troops as a stable. There were no major battles in that direct area, but twenty
                    miles south of Cartersville is Kennesaw Mountain, which was a famous point in
                    the progress down from Chattanooga to Atlanta. North of that is Resaca, where my
                    grandfather's uncle witnessed that battle. There were numerous smaller incidents
                    throughout the county that I grew up in, Fairfield County.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an aside, my grandfather was a young officer with
                        Sherman at the time, went dowand it was the Kennesaw Mountaiand came the
                        whole way down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: You know the area then.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he knew it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>When you were in high school, did the national or international world intrude
                    mucor any event?</p>
                <p>PIERCE: Absolutely not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was getting a blank look. (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: (laughs) Not at all. I mean I was good at geography and history and it
                    had an interest to me, but in the sense of the international events as they
                    progressed in the world, I had little idea. We're talking at the age of 14, 15,
                    16.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you graduated from high school in what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: '62.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the family pointing you, or were you pointing
                        yourself, towards anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No, it wasn't at all. I had good grades, and being a member of the
                    Presbyterian Church there was a certain link to Davidson College which had a
                    pretty good reputation. I was able to get a scholarship to go to Davidson; it
                    was not anything that I chose. It was not an intensive search type of mode that
                    you have today; it just seemed to me the natural place that I ended up without
                    much of an awareness of what Davidson was, or what an education there would
                    produce for me. At the time it was the thing you did upon graduating from high
                    school if you were going on to college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Davidson is where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Davidson is about 20 miles north of Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Davidson like? You were there '62 to '66, would
                        it have been?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>PIERCE: '62 to '66. The Presbyterian Church still had a very strong influence
                    over Davidson and its curriculum. Everyone was required to take courses in
                    religion. Required chapelassemblies basicallthat you sometimes had to, sometimes
                    not, go to three times a week, and vespers on Sunday evening. It was a certain
                    sensitive issue that the tenured professors had to believe that Jesus Christ was
                    the evangelical savior of the world, which at the time Davidson prided itself on
                    introducing new and sort of forward leaning ideas in theology. It was at times
                    embarrassing for certain college leaders to explain how you could advocate
                    certain ideas in theology or have professors advocate them and still have this
                    requirement for full professorialship. That was an interesting sidebar. And it
                    gave me an interest in religion.</p>
                <p>It's interesting. I think I was not a religious person as a youth and although I
                    attended church and Sunday school, the religious indoctrination that I did get
                    in my teenage years was totally wiped out after two years of courses in religion
                    in my first two years of college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, by the time you were at Davidson, which is not a
                        backwards college by any meanit's right up there with the Ivy League type
                        schools and alwas the political world, the national world and the
                        international world, beginning to cross your ken?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No. I had a little interest in history; I did take a couple of history
                    courses beyond the basic. Interestingly, and I haven't felt this in a long time,
                    but the outside ideas that were most interesting in the Davidson community were
                    ideas of theology.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That was a time at which the famous thought “God is dead” permeated and
                    it was immensely discussed by professors in courses that we had. I didn't have
                    any real interest in political science and I really didn't have any exposure to
                    what may or may not have been discussed sort of in and amongst political science
                    circles at college. Historically we did basically what I think has been done for
                    decades before that in studying British history or studying world histornothing
                    on the cutting edge of international events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Civil Rights movement, because this is
                        really cranked up, and here you are in southern North Carolina. You're in
                        the battleground there. But did that move in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>PIERCE: It was after that that Civil Rights became a major issue in wanting to
                    detract the attention of Davidson. In my class of maybe 300, there may have been
                    2 blacks; one was an exchange student from the Congo. Again, it was not a
                    topical issue. Davidson was a very conservative place. Davidson was very highly
                    fraternityized at the time. It's since become coeducational and drifted away
                    from this, but while there were Civil Rights demonstrations and Civil Rights
                    movements and issues popping around the country, Davidson in the main there was
                    an attempt to look at dismantling or reducing the influence of fraternities. The
                    major demonstration at Davidson during my four years there was one in support of
                    the fraternities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did anyone ever talk about diplomacy or American foreign
                        affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I'm trying to think to what degree. One of the things that did occur is
                    that it was mandatory to go into ROTC (Reserve Officers Training Corps) the
                    first two years there. The ROTC gentlemen are interested in getting you to sign
                    up for the total course and join the army. One of the issues they continually
                    pushed was Vietnathis was in '64, '6laying out the harsh reality of being an
                    enlisted man versus being an officer, although they didn't tell you about the
                    fatality rates amongst officers. They were sufficiently attuned to the
                    situation. They said, “It's going to happen; it's going to get worse; and
                    everyone who graduates from this class is going to be subject to a draft and you
                    can either go in as a private E-1 or you can go in as a second lieutenant. You
                    can make the decision right now.”</p>
                <p>I signed up for ROTC for the four years. After I graduated I did go into the
                    army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, by the time you went into the army, this would
                        be in '66?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Actually, no, it wasn't. ROTC produced different things for me. Firstly,
                    in your sophomore or junior year you had to attend a six-week basic course as a
                    Private E-1 at Fort Bragg. That was six weeks of hell for me. I've never spent a
                    more uncomfortable, unsavory period of time in my life. Fort Bragg, if you've
                    never been to the arefaithful North Carolinit's in rolling little pine stubs and
                    swamps of North Carolina where the skeeters (mosquitoes) are about two-feet-long
                    and the weather is hot as hell. It was designed, more or less as I recall, as
                    sort of a soothed infantry regiment where you wake up at five-thirty and you
                    stay up until midnight shining shoes and being harassed by a very typical sort
                    of drill sergeants. I was not looking forward to a career in the army after
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>As my senior year grew to an end, I had to do two things; I had to, number one,
                    put down my dream sheet of what branch I wanted to be in, and had to put in my
                    three choices or my four choices, at least one combat or one combat support
                    branch, which I did not want. I also had to put down on my dream sheet where I
                    would like to be posted. Vietnam was not on that list. I put down two rather,
                    what I considered interesting branches: military intelligence and transportation
                    of some kind. The third one I put was the engineers, which I figured by process
                    of elimination would be perhaps the best of any combat branch if I had to get
                    it. I also looked at all the places I could put down as to where I wanted to be
                    assigned: Germany, England, Vietnam, the U.S. (United States), Alaska, Thailand,
                    Laos, and Cambodia. So I thought if I put things close enough to Vietnam I might
                    get overlooked for Vietnam. So I put Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia.</p>
                <p>When I graduated I was a member of the Army Corps of Engineers; an English major.
                    But I was a member of the Army Corps of Engineers and signed for one year in
                    Thailand in 1967; they wanted me a year later than after I graduated. So I had
                    to figure out after I graduated what to do for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So just what did you do for a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I was, to some point, at a loss; I'd expected going into the military
                    rather quickly. I knew there was a shortage of engineer junior officers, but
                    apparently it was the way they were trying to program people in and there was a
                    real shortage apparently of lieutenantand second lieutenants especialland
                    especially in the Corps. I quickly enrolled in basic education courses at the
                    University of Chattanooga in TennessePsychology, Education 101, that type of
                    thinso I could get enough credits over the summer to apply for temporary
                    certification as a teacher. I was hoping to perhaps teach English for a year,
                    but they were all locked out. I ended up teaching Frencwhich I had not done very
                    at college and was the farthest thing from my minat a high school in a suburb of
                    Chattanooga, Tennessee for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's just a hard question to answer. I did not ever compare it to the
                    school I'd gone to. It was where I discovered that students can be rough;
                    teaching is extremely physical and very mentally demanding. I taught five
                    courses a day. It's where I developed an immense appreciation for grading
                    homework and how difficult it was, and how difficult it was to grade tests where
                    you make tests into essays or into writing tests and they become extremely
                    tedious, time-consuming, very difficult to rate. One of the teachers there, I
                    remember, was an oldie. The old English teacher who had attended the Scopes
                    Trial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the famous monkey trial.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>PIERCE: The monkey trial in Dayton, Tennessee in 1921, '28, I forget.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: A delightful older man. The Spanish teacher I knew very well; she seemed
                    to be very professional. Although my French was not good at all, I was hired
                    because they had a major problem. I was hired in August to begin in August. That
                    was hard for me and it was hard for the students. In the group of students I was
                    able to find there were one or two who were outstanding. One told me that he
                    wanted to go on to study French in college as a result of being taught by me,
                    which was very surprising. Another one, who was apparently somewhat just lower
                    than top tier in the country, as I recall, was given a full scholarship to
                    Princeton. The most disheartening thing in my year at Red Bank High School was
                    the pressure from his family, or just the pressure of just being from Tennessee
                    in the 1960s, he opted to stay and go to college in Tennessee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the military took you in, had you had any
                        engineering?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No, I figured out I was an English major in engineering, E-N-G, and the
                    army stopped spelling after that. I found it rather amazing because the Corps of
                    Engineers is the place that graduates from West Point aspire to, and only a very
                    small portion go there because the other branches have to have their share of
                    graduates. And yet, I, without any engineering whatsoever, got into the Corps of
                    Engineers.</p>
                <p>I was ordered to report to Fort Belvoir in June and I was prepared to have this
                    unsavory experience as I had at Fort Bragg. When I got there I found out that
                    that was not the case. Firstly, as an officer, you weren't treated like a
                    private, which I didn't know much about that. Living in a BOQ (Bachelor Officers
                    Quarters), getting a decent salary for being in the armnot a lot, but a decent
                    salarand the people that you met were just like you; you had English majors and
                    Poli-Sci (political science) majors. I remember there was a ballet major. From
                    all across the country. Very interesting people; good conversations and I made
                    some good friends.</p>
                <p>I was there for about maybe two months, six weeks, getting instruction in how to
                    be an engineer. More or less you go through an entire series of courses on how
                    to build bridges, how to build temporary bridges, how to lay concrete. Of course
                    they don't expect a second lieutenant to do all of that, but you've got experts
                    around and staff around you in the platoon or the unit that you will be in to do
                    the precise operation. You just need to know a bit about it. I think they were
                    looking at sort of a commonsense managerial approach to leading a unit of men,
                    either in combat or construction. I ended up going into construction, which I
                    was very pleased with. Again, getting away from that sort of Vietnam
                    orientation.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I think one of the things you also learn in engineering is you've got to
                    economize on material that a good engineer will use to be within the standards
                    of safety and the standards of aesthetics, but not to overdo your need for
                    supplies. But in the engineers where they didn't have time to go through all of
                    that and you've got more of a specialized area, the safety factor was enhanced
                    terribly so when everybody called for a certain tensile strength in your rebar
                    or called for a certain composition or width of concrete to make the optimal
                    support in a culvert system, that was not doubled, but it was enlarged
                    tremendously for the situation that an engineering unit would find itself out in
                    the field. We built in all these safety factors in the event that you would lead
                    a platoon on and you did have to build a bridge, you would have such safety
                    factors built into the operation that you would not risk the structural
                    integrity of the bridge or whatever you were building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After six weeks or two months of this, you must've had
                        engineering skills flowing from you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: (laughs) Not really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, you know, I mean trying to absorb what
                        they could throw at you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The thing that was comforting to me is I never was put into a situation
                    where I would have to be tested. I was assigned to be an assistant S-4, which
                    you might recall this is at a logistics aspect in a group headquarters for the
                    Corps of Engineers in eastern Thailand. The headquarters was a small unit,
                    independent, a little base camp outside of Korat, Thailand. That's where I went
                    in perhaps that September of '67. I was to stay there for one year.</p>
                <p>The headquarters group was under the command of a colonel and with various
                    engineering units attached to this group spread across eastern Thailand, from
                    the farthest north part down to the south doing various projectroad building;
                    there was a building of a cantonment inside Sattahip, Thailand in the southeast
                    corner. A cantonment being an area where you could receive supplies and later
                    distribute them into a system, into a network across the eastern highlanroad
                    building along the eastern ridge of Thailand. There were some special facilities
                    buildings that we built for the Air Force in Korat. We were building other roads
                    in Northeast Thailand as well as other facilities up in that area.</p>
                <p>The Army Corps of Engineers was in Thailand in support of the Air Force. The
                    mission of the Air Force in Thailand, as you might recall, was to provide
                    strikes from air cover, air support, and strikes in Vietnam. Our mission was to
                    simply support their facilities and their structures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was your first real look at a foreign country, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>PIERCE: I was definitely homesick. Although I never had any intention of studying
                    in Cartersville at all, I was extremely homesick for about two months. It was in
                    December, I think, as I was strolling through a marketplace in Korat, redolent
                    with scents and soundit sounds kind of trite, but it was just exotiand I sort of
                    had an epiphany. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed seeing people, I enjoyed walking
                    through the market, I enjoyed eating the food, I enjoyed everything about where
                    I was. It was about that time that I began to become sort of far more interested
                    in Thailand and quit concentrating on being homesick. I had a two year
                    obligation in the military: a year in Thailand and a virtual guarantee of a year
                    in the States. In other words, Vietnam was out of my life as an option. I stayed
                    a second year in Thailand and became a first lieutenant after a year, which
                    happened during that period of time, and then I extended a third year in the
                    Corps and kept that in Thailand as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you sort of getting to know the community in
                        Thailand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That didn't happen to any great degree. I had one Thai friend who worked
                    in my office. He took me down into the city several times. I met his parents and
                    his siblings; had several meals with them and enjoyed that very much. I liked
                    talking to his father. He had given me a smattering of introductions in
                    Hinduism, and then their food. And also Thai beer was very good at the time.</p>
                <p>I knew another friend, Chinese-Thai, as a contractor. Contractors love you when
                    you're in supply. But always was careful to avoid the pressures that you're
                    naturally inclined to by contractors, but became much more aware of the
                    environment that a businessman would work in, in Thailand. Aside from that, it
                    was work; you worked 10-, 12-hour days sometimes. Not a lot else to do.</p>
                <p>After my two years in Korat, I spent the third year in the far northeast at Sakon
                    Nakhon, Thailand. One of the things I loved to do, which we could do at the
                    time, was use Jeeps for private tours on the weekends. And I loved to drive
                    along the Mekong River on the Thai sidwe were not allowed to go on the Laos
                    sidstop in various towns, talk to people, look across the river, see who was
                    coming and going. I always thought the hills of Laos were far more intriguing
                    than Northeast Thailand. I don't know if you've ever been theryou'd see it's
                    sort of a dusty, not very hilly, not very inspiring area; a very poor and
                    neglected area of Northeast Thailand. Finding roadside restaurants, meeting a
                    lot of Thai, exploring, just experimenting with the local food and always the
                    good beer. I was just impressed by the innovation that the Thai had in just
                    coping with life.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>In Northeast Thailand, officers were specifically made to spend a weekend pass in
                    Bangkok. This was done by the battalion commander at the time in Northeast
                    Thailand to try to keep officers from uncompromising situations in the local
                    area around the military base that I was in. We had about a thousand people in
                    this battalion setting.</p>
                <p>Quite often I would find myself in Bangkok and end up hoofing it back to Sakon
                    Nakhon, which was 300-350 miles, which you could do in a day by local
                    transportation: by buses, taxis. And it was fun. It was challenging.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you beginning to start reading into Thailand or
                        Southeast Asian culture and all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Not a lot. I got interested in LaNortheast Thailand is Laand picked up a
                    few Lao expressions of decent, passable restaurant type; got to where I could
                    read road signs, which is not an insignificant achievement in the Thai language,
                    and tried to learn a little bit more Thai. After three years it was decent
                    restaurant Thai. Jokes, how to ward off touts and beggars, and how to be
                    genuinely friendly.</p>
                <p>I met a Peace Corps fellow up in Sakon Nakhon. He taught me a lot about Thai
                    politeness. The military does it better now, but then there was an attempt to
                    try to inculcate culturalization into so-called “moving forces.” There was no
                    SOFA for Thailand, which was a major problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: SOFA being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Status of Forces Agreement. For a period of time I worked in adjutants in
                    Northeast Thailand and one of the problems I dealt with in military justice was
                    some of the problems that we had there also we has in Korat. Thais are very easy
                    to offend. The king's picture is on their currency, the baht falls to the ground
                    and starts to blow away. You step on it. No, not at all. You don't step on it.
                    You were going to step on the king. Holding handjust like in many places in the
                    third-world, men held hands with men and it was not unusual for you to be
                    talking to a Thai and he's holding your hand, and you want to recoil but you
                    don't. It's not unusual foand we've learned a lot more about this and it's very
                    obvious, but in Oriental societies especially, but other societies, people have
                    a closer space in social contact than Americans are comfortable with. And you've
                    got to learn to at least accept that. These are the types of things that after a
                    long period of time in Thailand I got used to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how the American military was
                        working with the Thais? Did it seem to be going fairly well or?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes it was. This is at my level as a second lieutenant, a first
                    lieutenant, and ultimately a captain. Well there were two things as I recall and
                    obviously it's not historical; it's not liable to be accurate. But we were
                    building roads, we were building bridges, we were building culvert systems,
                    especially in Northeast Thailand where I was the last year. All of this in
                    support of our observations that we used to launch raids, primarily against
                    Vietnam, for the Air Force. But in the northeast for so many years it had
                    historically been a neglected area. To see roads built and what it would do for
                    villages two or three kilometers from the road, in order to facilitate a
                    villager's use of the road to get to Udon, a city that without the road might
                    take a day to get to, or half a day to get to, now you could get to it in an
                    hour or an hour and fifteen minutes. And the amount of commerce that you would
                    see; as I would be driving these roads or going on these roads on the bus trying
                    to get back to my headquarters on Sunday night, packed with people and getting
                    off at these little waysides along these highways and walking two, three, four
                    kilometers back into the rice paddies to their village. We were facilitating all
                    of that. I consider what we were doing not so much in support of the Air Force,
                    but in support of basically giving the Thai a real sort of boost in their
                    development in an area that needed it badly and was threatened at the time by an
                    insipient sort of Communist movement which we called Thai Cong. We were in
                    league with the Thai Corps of Engineers, the Royal Thai Engineers, who in
                    Northeast Thailand were also doing some road building in concert with us. We
                    frequently had get-togethers with them. That's where I discovered their immense
                    propensity for drink.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about what you were doinwas there any concern about
                        indigenous Communist insurrections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes. That was the local insipient Thai network, which I don't recall. It
                    was not an issue that a construction support person got into. MB fleeting
                    conversation with military intelligence I got the impressioprobably more than
                    thaof Chinese support in one way or the other for them. I was under the
                    impression that the insipient Communist groups, which were being hunted and were
                    being shot at, were being killed. But they had decided that we were good and
                    that we could stay. Because we were going to leave roads and they liked roads.
                    They thought roads were good. They could see that as a road down to Bangkok.</p>
                <p>The year after I left, however, it got untenable for us; we began getting
                    threats. And I believe by '7I'm not surwe had pulled out of the area because of
                    threats against us. We were not offensive; we had a normal issue of standard
                    weaponry. We were not any fighting constabulary whatsoever. When the threats
                    came this was about the time the Nixon Doctrine was getting into full sway, and
                    as I understand it that's when we started leaving the area, pulled back. We
                    completed one road between Sakon Nakhon and Nakhon Phanom on the Mekong border,
                    and we were working with the Royal Thai engineers on a culvert system for
                    another road between Sakon Nakhon and That Phanom on the Mekong River. It was on
                    that road that we began to get threatened and then we pulled out.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then in 1970 you left Thailand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I left Thailand and I left the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any thoughts about what you were going to
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No, not a one. I had no thoughts whatsoever. I got out of the military in
                    June and I thought maybe I'll go to law school, because my grandfather was a
                    lawyer. Well starting in June to go to law school in September was difficult
                    back then, too. I called uI think the best place to try this was the University
                    of Georgia, from which my grandfather graduated. They said something like, “Well
                    what about your LSAT?” and I said, “L-S-A-what?” They said, “Well you have to
                    take that.” So I quickly found out what the LSAT (Law School Admission Test)
                    was, got a little brochure and saw that it was being given in July and looked
                    around and it was given in Marietta, Georgia; it was given in Rome, Georgia; it
                    was given in Atlanta, Georgia. It was also given in Paris, France. I decided I'd
                    rather take it in Paris as opposed to Rome or Marietta, so I went to Paris to
                    take the LSAT in July and got indoctrinated into Europe. And it was a time where
                    I spent two weeks sort of sitting in the Jardin des Tuileries reading this book
                    on how to pass the LSAT, took it at the American university there and then
                    roamed Europe for awhile. Going down to Marseilles, trying to get to Tunisia
                    where my great-uncle lived, finding out that all the planes in July were booked.
                    I went to Algiers instead which was very vexing to me because it was then that I
                    was introduced to the fact that there was terrorism in the Middle East. Because
                    at the time I was trying to do this, they had had two instances of Palestinians
                    high-jacking aircrafts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well we're talking about Black September, too. That was
                        not a good time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No it wasn't. Of course I was na�ve and I didn't read the news, so I went
                    to Algiers. (laughs) I knew that Algiers was not exactly friendly to America at
                    the time and that they don't like our Middle East policy. That's about the
                    extent of what I knew. But when I got there I talked myself into a three-day
                    visa. It was a pit. It was utterly dirty, a very, very sort of poor place,
                    extremely expensive with the Algerian dinar vastly overvalued. You had to
                    convert at the airport. All this good stuff. But I was able from there to fly to
                    Tunisia where I stayed with my great-uncle for about two weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you happen to have a great-uncle in Tunisia?</hi>

                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>PIERCE: My great-uncle, my grandfather's youngest brother or next youngest
                    brother, was an extremely handsome man who was very intelligenself-educated,
                    taught himself French. He was in the Coast Guard during World War I and
                    afterwards decided to go to Europe and bum around, which he did. He was a very
                    charming man and he circulated amongst some very nice people in Parivery
                    interesting artist people. He met his wife-to-be who there. He was very
                    sensitive whenever he was asked what he did for a living. He didn't like that
                    question at all. And from a more Protestant viewpoint he didn't do anything. But
                    he was told to go to Hammamet, Tunisia, and build a home, by an older man whom
                    he felt immense respect for. So he did. In essence he started the artistic
                    colony of Hammamet, Tunisia, which is today a rather sort of prominent area. But
                    he started it in 1928.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what did you do while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I went to the beach a lot and read a lot. Traveled around a little bit.
                    He always had people coming in to visit his house. He'd have some secondary
                    author. On his wall he had pictures of movie stars, and literati of the day
                    would come and visit him. Jean Jui, Jacques Cocteau, Trevor Howard, the Beatles
                    or was it Paul McCartney? I forget. He had little mementos like signed pictures
                    and they would come and autograph things and stick them on his wall. He had a
                    lovely library.</p>
                <p>I went back and found out that I was on the waiting list for the University of
                    Georgia. I almost didn't make it in, given that I had started so late, but did.
                    At the end of my next to last quarter, my second year, I took the Foreign
                    Service exam. I had done it once in college. I did it in college just as a lark
                    and didn't do very well and a friend of mine suggested I do it in law school. I
                    did it and didn't really expect anything out of it and I passed it. As I was
                    progressing through law school, they said, “Well come on up for the oral,” and I
                    did and I passed that, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall the oraany of the questions or things they
                        were asking you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Some questions about Thailand. At the time you had to opt for the cone
                    you wanted to go into and I looked at all the qualifications and decided that
                    the best chance I had was in admin. (Administrative Cone), so I opted for admin.
                    Questions like, “Where was the setting of Lord Jim?” because on one of my trips
                    in Thailand I had taken R&amp;R (Rest and Recuperation Leave) and went to
                    Brunei. Questions like, “Who was Lady Mo?” Lady Mo was the statue of a woman in
                    the middle of Korat, who several centuries ago, I think it was the
                    Burmesmight've been the Cambodianwere invading and she massed an army together
                    and went out and defeated them. A little bit about the Nixon Doctrine and then
                    normal types of admin, managerial questions.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I don't recall. I found that my legal education helped; appreciation for
                    the Constitution, appreciation for John Marshall, for whom I have developed an
                    immense respect.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find law school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Well, hard. My academic career at Davidson was not stellar. When I took
                    the LSAT I did very, very well on the LSAshocked me. So I thought that it would
                    be just natural for me to coast through law school. Well it didn't work that
                    way. I learned how to study. My first year I was sort of adrift and didn't do
                    very well at all, and then I began to study. I remember I was happy we could
                    have Saturdays because Saturdays gave me 12 hours to study as opposed to the
                    normal six to seven that I was studying out of class. It was in my second year
                    that I'd be able to turn it around. My third year I was doing quite well.</p>
                <p>With a quarter left, in December of 1972, I got a call at homI just happened to
                    be therfrom the Foreign Service saying, “Would you like to join the Foreign
                    Service?” I said, “Well, I have a quarter of law school left and I really sweat
                    a lot for this degree and I'd sort of like to keep it,” and I got the rigmarole
                    of, “Well, you're on the list. You might not be on the list in three months.”
                    Blah, blah, blah. So I accepted it and dropped out of law school with a quarter
                    left, under the proviso that I would takI got some type of agreemenLWOP (Leave
                    Without Pay) after my first tour, and also the university assented to let me
                    return after two years overseas in the Foreign Service. So that's what
                    happened.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: January of 1973.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The compositiolet's see, maybe there were 30 new officers; the average
                    age was 28, which was my age at the time, but there were two or three that had
                    just barely graduated. There were a couple in the Peace Corps, a few retired
                    attorneys, a retired stockbroker. Actually there were a lot with Peace Corps
                    experience. Some with military like myself. There were maybe three or four
                    political officers, three or four economic officers, and the rest of us were
                    consular or admin. officers. When I went in, there was the business of a
                    decision that had been taken at that time if we were going to open up consulates
                    all up and down Vietnam. There was a big lobbying effort to get volunteers to go
                    to these places, which a couple of people did do.</p>

                <p>I don't know how the courses are today; I would imagine they're not unusually
                    different. I mean this is a B&amp;F (Budget and Fiscal) course, this is what you
                    do for representation, this is what you do for political reporting accounts; the
                    usual mix of things. Little briefings, sort of a sparse briefing by the Agency
                    (Central Intelligence Agency). I'm trying to think, did DOD (Department of
                    Defense) brief us? I don't recall. What the Op Center (Operations Center)
                    does.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No. Not at all. I mean I was in the admin cone. The crying need, which is
                    always the case for admin officers, had been the fringes of the Sahara,
                    Frencassignments to N'Djamena or Nouakchott. I seem to recall both of those
                    where on there and maybe Cotonou was on there. It was amazing, there was
                    something like eight Francophone admin African assignments for admin officers,
                    and little else.</p>

                    “wish list,” and I had had to go find out where it was. And when I called my
                    mother up and told her I'd been assigned to Surabaya, she asked if it were
                    farther away than Thailand was. It was the one place in the world that I
                    could've gone to that was. (laughs)</p>

                    you feel that facility or relaxation of the languagthere's a major jump. A jump
                    in use of vocabulary, a jump in appreciation of dialect, and a jump in simply
                    formulating your words, which makes it not easy at all. There's also, when you
                    start getting into this type of dialect which is frowned oI understand that, but
                    it's what you use when you're theryou get into major pronunciation problems. It
                    is in some ways, but at the same time I find it at a level of subtlety that's
                    not easy to master.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Okay, well, the relationship was decent. Suharto at that time was close
                    to us in various ways. How close, I don't know. Relationships were good. Pretty
                    good. I think good economic times and good political ones. The conventional
                    reason of course being Suharto was a welcome development as opposed to his
                    predecessor, Sukarno, just in terms of sheer stability and continuity he
                    brought. And in streamlining the country's political process, which by all
                    accounts, was a chaotic one in the '50s; one that Sukarno began to master, but
                    in wrong ways in the '60s. Suharto was able to first bow to it a bit, just
                    barely, and slowly basically castrate it. And the streamlined approach of
                    Golkar, which is the so-called non-party of all the diverse groups underneath
                    the umbrella of an organization which, by the way, Suharto happened to head, and
                    made the political system more streamlined. It wasn't chaotic. And there was a
                    certain hope that it would produce genuine reform; it would produce ultimately
                    democracy. Not to be, but that was what the hope was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is Surabaya and how did it fit into the Indonesian
                        set-up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Surabaya is the second largest city of Indonesia. Currently there are
                    about four million people. At least in the daytime, four or five. It's in East
                    Java; it's an hours plane ride from Jakartmaybe 800 kilometers, but I think it's
                    more than that. It was the major city in the Dutch colony, the major commercial
                    port, the largest city, which had the first overt resistance to the return of
                    the Dutch; actually the British came in their stead when they first came back in
                    1945. And this is the place where the Indonesian Revolution occurred against the
                    returning Dutch. Therefore it's called “the City of Heroes.” After the war, as
                    Jakarta gained more preeminence, and centralization took more power, bit by bit,
                    from elsewhere in the country, Surabaya suffered for it. In the early '70s it
                    was beginning to see a small spark of resurgence of its commercial vitality. It
                    was there anyway, and it had the beginnings of some of the light industry that
                    ultimately turned out to be pretty substantial. Today the Surabaya area produces
                    probably 15 percent of the country's economic growth.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: At the time it was not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The first guy when I was there was Bob Randolph. After a year,
                    a-year-and-a-half, he was replaced by Dick Howland. After that Dick was consul.
                    We had a consulate in Surabaya since 1880, maybe a little later. We had a
                    continuous presence, only interrupted during the war. We returned in 1949. It
                    was upgraded to a consulate general in 1988 perhaps, maybe a little later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our consulate doing when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: It was a sleepy post. There seemed to be a pretty brisk sort of interest
                    in commerce, trying to promote commerce, to provide information to American
                    businesses, to facilitate information for the few American businessmen who were
                    there, the larger number of American companies there. And interest in political
                    reporting on developments throughout eastern Indonesia. The consular district at
                    the time had a simple job in East Java, Bali, and Lesser Sunda, east and west.
                    In other words, from Central Java all the way out to West Timor. Lesser Sunda
                    are the islands between Bali and East Timor; the two provinces, rather
                    impoverished, rather poor places.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Administrative officer was my primary duty, but I also did about 40 percent
                    consular work. We tended to have a lot of people die in Bali. It required a lot
                    of effort on the part of the consulate to work deaths. Going down to Bali,
                    carrying through on the decedent's next of kin's wishes in terms of the
                    disposition of the remains. In many cases that meant shipping them back to the
                    States. One specific case for me was a cremation. I also did one of these deaths
                    where she was buried locally in Yogyakarta, which is a special district
                    surrounded by Central Java.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working as administrative officer

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: For someone who had a little experience it wasn't too taxing. I'm trying
                    to think how many houses did we havfive, six? Three were U.S. government-owned
                    or leased; I don't think any leases were renewed during that period of time. The
                    office was leased. Maintenance was minimal. Furnishings were already there. We
                    had a sub-cashier. Then you had accountability that you had to do. We had one
                    construction project which was significant. We built a classified vault which
                    today is the one in Surabaya we would use as our basic holding area. With the
                    supervision of a Seabee and a local contractor it took about six to eight weeks
                    to do that. Probably even today it's the most secure, strongest, best-built
                    building in the whole country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One has looked at Indonesia and so many things sort of ran
                        down. How did you find it? I mean, the Indonesians as workerbecause you were

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I got the same thing when working with Thais in Northeast Thailand. The
                    conventionaand stereotypicaway to approach it was to cite slip-shod work and a
                    tendency towards them not having a good work ethic. I think, firstly, you
                    explain, number one, the caloric intake is so much smaller, and therefore they
                    don't have the energy that one would expect coming from the West. The second
                    thing, I think, is that you specify very clearly what you want. In any case, you
                    have to watch very carefully what people are doing. In that particular
                    construction, when we were doing reinforced rebar and a certain quality of
                    concrete, the engineering did help in my understanding of what was going on. And
                    you would do that anywhere. You had to stick to strict standards and you had to
                    look very carefully at what was going on. We had a very good Chinese for a
                    contractor and he employed indigenous Indonesians, and he knew what we were
                    trying to go for and he did it. He did it quite well.</p>
                <p>I found this to be the case over and over again. I never felt any great sort of
                    disparity between what I expected and what I got in terms of a contract. We were
                    just being careful which is what you should do anyplace.</p>

                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>PIERCE: My second tour was in Damascus as GSO (General Service Officer) had more
                    of an unsatisfying aspect to contractors than had been the case in Surabaya.</p>
                <p>A couple of things about Surabaya I do need to underline. I did consular work and
                    also was allowed to do some political reporting, with a junior officer slot,
                    with three State Department officers at the time. One, the consul gave me East
                    and Central Java, the econ/commercial officer, who did the other part of
                    consular work, did the same type of thing in East and Central Java. We
                    frequently went to Bali, which wasn't looked upon as a reporting situation. Two
                    things that stand out were the travel that I did, and the plane crash.</p>
                <p>The plane crash was a PAN/AM (Pan-American) plane, and I forget exactly the
                    flight number; it was coming from Hong Kong to Sydney, as I recall. There used
                    to be two flights a week through Bali and they were the only non-Indonesian
                    flights allowed outside of Jakarta at the time. I got a call one night about
                    1:00 a.m. from Jakarta about the plane was missing and was told that I and my
                    colleague, the econ/commercial officer, should get down to the site of this
                    crash and begin to investigate as soon as possible. Which meant that we drove.
                    We took our FSN (Foreign Service National) consular clerk with us. We had been
                    aware of how many people were on the aircraft, 121; 28, I think, were Americans.
                    Around about 10:00 a.m. we found ourselves in northwest Bali looking up at a
                    mountain perhaps two or three miles away, and with binoculars, at the very top
                    of it you could see sort of a black char. And this began my experience for about
                    the next two weeks of trying to manage American interests in a situation like
                    that. Trying to deal with the host of bureaucrats and organizations that were
                    interested in this, and the occasional contacts with family members who came to
                    the island or who were on the island waiting for the people on the plane. It was
                    an extremely trying time. It was a perioone 36-, 48-hour periowith six hours
                    sleep. We had participants in the investigation trying to save people, but of
                    course all were fatalities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Apparently the PAN/AM plane, as I understand iand this is from reading
                    some transcript of the black box several years later navigationally strayed and
                    was not where it was supposed to be. It was supposed to be coming into an
                    approach at the airport to the south of the island and instead found this 10,000
                    foot mountain in its path on the northwest side. I cannot remember if this
                    navigation error was described in the NTSB (National Transportation Safety
                    Board) report on it. The plane hit some of the mountain, broke probably into the
                    portion that dropped over the mountain. As I found out, it was only then that
                    the aircraft fuel engulfed the plane and combustion occurred and anybody who
                    would've been alive at that time, would've been annihilated. We had the FBI
                    (Federal Bureau of Investigation) there as an identification team. They had the
                    NTSB there because it was a PAN/AM plane. We had a gaggle of PAN/AM vice
                    presidents. This had been the third PAN/AM crash in the South Pacific in 18
                    months. We had the FILflight engineers something, I forgot. We had
                    representatives from the French, the British, the Australians, the Japanese, all
                    the consulates. We had a crust of Indonesian bureaucracy and I'm trying to think
                    if we had anyone else.</p>
                <p>The site of the air crash was a six or seven-hour drive north of Denpasar, the
                    capital of Bali. No one was alive. I never visited the crash site, which
                    apparently took three days ultimately for a U.S. military team to get tand they
                    tried, although the Balinese could get there in about 12 hours. It was, and
                    still is, in a really quite undeveloped area of Bali; very much jungle.
                    Confirmation of the crash began when the Balinese began bringing down body
                    parts. There were no full bodies, but some torsos. They were brought down and
                    put in bags. The FBI team was there to try to help with identification although
                    to me it didn't seem possible that this could happen. They set up a workshop in
                    the hangar down in Denpasar and were convinced that they would be in a position
                    to identify some of the remains. Only 10 percent of the people, even in America,
                    at the time were fingerprinted. Their effort was stopped by the Indonesian
                    government at the behest, as I understand it, of PAM/AM a day or two after it
                    started. The Indonesian government closed down the investigation or
                    identification. That was very upsetting to me.</p>
                <p>The one thing I was able to extract was a promise that the Indonesian government
                    would produce death certificates, which we could use to process the report of
                    American citizens' death. The problem with the remains that we did have, and
                    they were substantiaseveral body bagwas that the Japanese side, the Shinto
                    Japanese, wanted to see Japanese citizens cremated. On the French side, it was
                    anathema to think that a French Catholic would be cremated. So the body bags
                    were divided, and obviously not everyone in one body bag being burned was a
                    Shinto, and everybody in the ones that were being buried was a French Catholic.
                    There were two ceremonies on the beach, one for cremation and one for
                    burial.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: Yes. There was one I knew well who was waiting at the airport in Denpasar
                    and she wanted to visit the site. She never did. You couldn't get to the site.
                    Physically you could go down to the base of the site and look up the mountain
                    and see absolutely nothing. But she stayed for quite a long time. It was very
                    hard to go out and go up to the site and spend six hours on the road and two or
                    three hours talking to people at the base next to the mountain. At the end of
                    that day you would come back and you'd talk to one another. Nothing much to say,

                <p>PIERCE: Not at that time. Not in 1974. I think it was in April of '74. I'm not
                    sure. Not at that time. The major victory that I think my colleague and I got
                    was the death certificates which enabled us to write an honest report on death
                    of American citizenan actual one as opposed to a presumptive onwhich certainly
                    facilitated inheritance issues, insurance issues, which I think at least was

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Well the other thing was the travel. Two parts to the travel. My boss
                    loved to travel in Java, which was nice. So my colleague and I, the
                    econ/commercial officer, spent a lot of time traveling on the small islands
                    jetting out toward West Timor: Lombok, the next island over from Bali which has
                    turned into sort of a tourist destination now; Sumba, which is an island
                    somewhat remote southwest of Timor; and Timor itself. And then I took two other
                    types of tripone with Howland, who was the other consul, to then Portuguese
                    Timor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that like at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Portuguese Timor at the timthis was just after Caetano fell, which you
                    may recall was Salazar's successor. He didn't last that long. Then when the
                    whole colonial empire began to fall apart, with the Portuguese giving its
                    blessing and basically they were ending up going into some self-determination
                    mode. So in Timor you had sort of the beginning of an emergence of, number one,
                    not chaos in a physical sense, but certainly a political chaos. The emergence of
                    political parties. And you had three: FRETILIN, which has become the ultimate
                    successor today; something called a UDT which was primarily a bunch of
                    Portuguese and Timorese, sort of conservative with ties to the military; and
                    then another party which was for integration with Indonesia. I don't want to say
                    that it was simply straight absolutely a tool of Indonesia; there might have
                    been some Timorese who actually wanted to integrate with Indonesia. I talked to
                    them all. Firstly with my econ/commercial colleague, and secondly when I went
                    with Dick Howland the second time.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>The most reassuring at the time, in the sense of politicsaying we want a stable
                    relationship with Portugal, we want to maintain our ties, we want constitutional
                    democracvery vague and not very substantive, but just reassurinwas the UDT.
                    FRETILIN, at the time was led by Ramos Horta who won the Nobel Prize three years
                    ago. In my day he was thinner, much younger obviously. The first time I met him
                    he was in a sarong on a porch in the outskirts of Dili. There was a Marxist
                    twinge to the language. I don't recall exactlagain it was vague and very, very
                    unsubstantive, but a lot of accent on what the people desire and what the people
                    need and the people need to own. But not much beyond that. And the guy who was
                    in charge of the other party seemed just to be reading a script. I think it was
                    just sort of likit would be very na�ve to savery na�ve potential leaders who
                    were suddenly given an option, “You can do anything you want. This country is
                    yours; it's not ours.” After 400 and however many years the Portuguese basically
                    just walked away. And they didn't have a lot to work with. I'm not very familiar
                    with just how much education and whether they were members of the group who had
                    any great amount of scholastic study of politics. Practically, it seemed that
                    there was none. We saw them twice. It was after the last trip which was probably
                    about May of 1975 maybe, and then November of 1975 was when the whole thing
                    collapsed. A lot of struggle. The Indonesian invasion in November and the events
                    that just deteriorated after that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any precursor to the Indonesians moving in? Was
                        this when you were down there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: When I went down there, there were none. I do not know. I guess if you
                    started analyzing iI haven'the events that occurred, the coups, the
                    counter-coups that occurred amongst these political groupings, with the
                    Portuguese governor still there, and before the Indonesian invasion, you may
                    have seen the precursors. As I recall from the historical record, the UDTers, or
                    whatever their reincarnation was, first tried to take over. FRETILIN was in a
                    position to counter that and the UDT types with somI'm not sure, I wasn't there
                    when this occurrethe UDT types, a large number of them, ran to the border of
                    Indonesia and were not allowed in until they agreed to seek an alliance with the
                    Indonesian military. That's a conventional reading of it beyond where I was. And
                    this was the pretext under which the military along with the IndonesianI am
                    under the impressiowere able to first go in. Again, I don't know the answer to
                    that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Again, I didn't have a brief or any direct information. In fact, had I
                    done it I don't think it would've been well-received. This is the Java area,
                    which was where most of this started. As I understand it, the slaughtering of
                    Communists began in Surabaya. In fact, one of my contacts in Surabaya told me
                    about the bodies piling up in Surabaya for weeks. Dick Howland, who was
                    political officer in Jakarta at the time this occurred, did exhaustive reporting
                    on it. So I think the issue was a current one in the Surabaya portfolio. As I
                    recall, the types of things he wrote were more looking at development. One of
                    the things he impressed upon me is that when he first made the trip from Jakarta
                    to Surabaya as political officer in the mid '60s before Sukarno was out, he'd
                    count dead bodies on the roadead from starvatiotwo or three, just abandoned
                    corpses lying in the road. You could see naked people walking everywhere. People
                    were dirt poor. He told me in '74, '75, it doesn't happen anymore. The progress
                    was immense since the people were not starving to death, and people did have
                    clothes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Obviously it did, but nothing had any grave effect on us. I think one of
                    the things which I can go back to, my last tour in Surabaya and also a few
                    nuggets of my first tour, is this ingrained suspicion, mistrustfulness, deelike
                    a battle to the deatwith communism that occupied Indonesia and it had been
                    ascribed in one way for their occupation of East Timor because of the FRETILIN
                    coup. Although they may say that they had no intention of Marxism as a doctrine,
                    I think the Indonesians rightfully could fear that was a possibility. You had
                    Wetar which was the last sort of stronghold of the Indonesian Communist Party,
                    where there was still some anti-government activity and I think it was
                    aggressive, perhaps as late as the late '60s. Wetar was in East Java. It's also
                    where President Sukarno is buried. So the collapse in Vietnam was of immense
                    interest to them, but from my vantage point I didn't see it in any concrete,
                    direct way. It just wasn't what I was studying and it did not come up in the
                    political reporting that I did when I traveled outside of Java.</p>
                <p>I also traveled outside the consular district. I just went to isolated, remote
                    places in the country. The one that's worth noting is I went to the island of
                    Ambon. I'm trying to think, I did this just as a tourist and it would've been
                    perhaps in '74. Ambon has a very interesting history in the sense of its
                    differentness from the rest of the country. The Ambonese were far more inclined
                    toward the Dutch in the revolution and were in fact used by the Dutch, which is
                    not unusual, during the period of colonialization. Also in the revolution as
                    auxiliaries.</p>

                        in Algeria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: It's a very beautiful place. I stayed there about 48 hours. It was just
                    casual visiting. Within five hours I had made three contacts. Their explanations
                    of the disgust and hatred of the Ambonese against the Javanese was just
                    palpablvery visible, very prominent. They said several things about them. The
                    first one is that transmigration was bringing in the beginnings of Javanese
                    colonies. The Javanese eat rice, we don't eat rice. So they begin to build rice
                    paddies which our terrain doesn't accommodate, and import immense amounts of
                    rice. Where does the money for that rice come from? It comes from our budget so
                    we end up subsidizing these Javanese. And there was the Golkar indoctrination.
                    It was an overall tone of being anti-Javanese. At the time, and you could see
                    this later, Ambon and that part of the Malukus always prided itself on religious
                    harmony. Ambonese were in part Muslim and part Christian, irrespective of
                    Javanese or other transmigrants. They had superimposed on their society, because
                    apparently much earlier in the past there was antagonism of a religious nature,
                    something called “pela”. Pela was the relationship between one village and
                    another village. As I recall, and I could be mistaken. The pela was a special
                    relationship that they had of cooperation, where at specific times the villages
                    from one group would go and assist villages of another group in a communal
                    project and the bond was increased. And they would have, from time to time, pela
                    warming ceremonies. I'm not sure if per force the villages were of different
                    religions, but by and large they were. And this synopsis increased the
                    inter-religious harmony. People, whenever you talked to them, talked about the
                    island, and this is what they would raise about the harmony in Amba. And it was
                    true up until two years ago.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: Yes it was. I enjoyed it. I had three years in Thailand and then I had

                    program. And I fished around with the possibility of trying to get Chinese. At
                    the end of that tour I also went back and finished my law school career which
                    was two-and-a-half months. It was no big deal. But I finished my law degree. I
                    never practiced, I never even took the bar, but I had the degree.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>But I found out that I just didn't get a warm reception at the time for going
                    into Chinese, which I wanted to do. I figured that Southeast Asia and Asia in
                    general were attractive to me. I enjoyed them and I moved around well in the
                    area. I just liked it. But I just didn't get the green lights that I wanted. And
                    I was talking to somebody in Personnel and they had a list of places that I
                    could go and Beirut was starting to get nasty in '75. For some reason I didn't
                    try. These were admin spots. GSO (General Services Officer) Damascus came up and
                    I said I'd like to go there. I had no clue, nothing, but I was assigned and went
                    to become GSO in Damascus, perhaps in July of '75.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: In '76 the relationship had taken a turn for the good. Kissinger had been
                    through I think in the year previous, or perhaps earlier, doing a lot of shuttle
                    diplomacy in the Middle East and had agreed to restore a full embassy.
                    Ambassador Richard Murphy had gotten there just before I had, and we had the
                    beginnings of a rather, for Syria, large AID (Agency for International
                    Development) mission. Well, relatively largmaybe 20 people ultimately. So the

                <p>PIERCE: I was struck by two things. Firstly, so much of the city, which is quite
                    beautifully set, was surrounded by Socialist architecture buildingrather
                    non-descript, very grey. The other thing is the extensive, pervasive presence of
                    what people there call “G2,” in other words the internal security agency. I
                    think there must've been about four. But you're first taken aback by their
                    presence on street corners and in front of houses of prominent people and
                    offices. Armed thugs basically. Not in uniform but sporting what always looked
                    like submachine guns.</p>

                    it didn't seem as pervasive as it might have. Every office building, from time
                    to time, on streets, but not, going to my mind, a real glorification cult. There
                    were occasional incidents where you could learn of violence in the city:
                    assassinations, bombing attempts, and also reported examples of internal
                    security getting rid of people. It was unusual seeing all the embassies of
                    countries that we have no relations with there: the Cubans, the North

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I don't recall. They must've been, but I'm not aware of them. And the
                    East Bloc in profusion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. What was life like there? I mean just sort of
                        personal life at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I didn't have much; as GSO I worked quite hard. We were in the midst of
                    expanding at a time in which the economy was just starting to have a
                    construction boom and one of my main jobs was finding housing leases;
                    negotiating leases with landlords mainly for the AID mission. There was, in that
                    sense, sort of an economic boom, although in reality the economy never was much
                    of anything. Of course the currency was controlled and the rate of exchange
                    artificially high.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you or members of the embassy were
                        particularly harassed or given a difficult time by the security people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: It's my impression that the security people, the G-2, had extreme
                    interest in us. They were always on the lookout for Americans in the embassy or
                    any hint of behavior they didn't like, for any indication of any type of conduct
                    that would be considered unsavory. Sexual deviancy was seen to be a
                    preoccupation of theirs. I in GSO had probably the best contact with the local
                    FSNs in the embassy. They were required every four years, I believe, to go to
                    G-2 and get cleared to work for us and during this process they were always
                    interrogated or asked questions. One of them was bold enough to tell me what
                    happened when he went. Basically what they would do was list to him all the
                    single members in the embassy and say, “What do you know about them?” and in
                    this particular conversation he told me he didn't know anything untoward about
                    them, but they were always listed. As for myself, I'm aware that my apartment
                    was entered by G-2.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: I was a bachelor at the time.</p>
                <p>My apartment was entered by G-2 when I had a maid there. She was taken outhis

                    they had free run of my apartment. I found this out several months after this
                    occurred. This was a time I began dating the person who I was to marry.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: She was Lebanese. She worked at the embassy in Beirut and when the
                    embassy went down to a skeleton crew with no outside operations, she was given
                    the option either of going back home near Sidon on leave without pay until
                    further notice, or working TDY (Temporary Duty) for the embassy in Damascuand
                    that's where we met. The internal security picked up on our meetings and began
                    harassing her. It may have been at that time that they began harassing me
                    through my apartment, I don't know. When the harassment against her became
                    direct, she quit and went back to Lebanon.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, one is so used to the Soviet style thing where a

                        Was there any of this sort of “honey trap,” I think the term is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Not that I'm aware of. She was interviewed by internal security and it
                    was a quite difficult, extremely tedious task for her. It frightened her very
                    severely.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just trying to pick up the different styles. This was

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Again, the conversations I had with AID on how they worked didn't reveal
                    any great different style. I mean I wasn't interested in what they were doing.
                    It was a third-world country; it had an awful lot in terms of economic
                    development needs. Our program was modest although the personnel resources AID
                    put there were large. I don't have any idea of what precisely they were
                    doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your time there were you able to get out and travel
                        around much or were you pretty well kept in Damascus by your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I traveled quite a lot on the weekends, doing a lot of what tourists do.
                    Indeed Syria is very beautiful, even day trips out of Damascus. You could go to
                    the north and over toward the coast there's a crusader castle, Krak des
                    Chevaliers. Actually it's not on the coast but it's maybe within 15 miles of the
                    coast. You could go down south to As Suwayda where there is a coliseum. Basra,
                    which was extremely attractive. The town of Homs had reasonably good diversions,
                    nothing much there. It's sort of famous for being a town of dunces.</p>
                <p>You can take a trip, which I did, across the desert to Palmyra. The conventional
                    way was too long, but I tried the short cut and we made it there. The Palmyra
                    ruins oI'm trying to think of the name of the kingdoQueen Zenobia. Basically
                    4th-century A.D., subdued by the Romans. I took longer trips to Aleppo, once on
                    official business to survey our burned-out consulate there. The Syrian mobs
                    burned that out in 1967. I also took a trip over to Deir ez-Zor on the
                    Euphrates, about a three-and-a-half, four hour drive east of Aleppo. It is an
                    old archeological site, the Kingdom of Mari, I think. That was the one that was
                    being excavated. Extremely interesting, just very, very deserty. On the coast Al
                    Hamidiyah. Aleppo also is inland. On the coast the cities of Latakia, Banias,
                    and Tartus. Very, very interesting. Very pretty places. Extremely green and
                    filled with archeological treasures. Very nice place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the fact that Syria and Iraq had poor relations
                        reflect itself while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: It goes up and it goes down. At the time I was there it was down. Not to
                    any great degree as I recall. There are a couple of things perhaps in the back
                    of my memory suggesting that yes, you were aware of it but it was not as though
                    it was a hot topic amongst people. It was all sort of rivalry within the Baath
                    Party and whose Baath leader was following which line of Baathism at the time.
                    Sure, it always pervaded the atmosphere, but it wasn't a day to day problem, or
                    of interest to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the situation in Lebanon? What was it at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Lebanon had fallen into chaos or was beginning to fall into that long,
                    long period of what they used to call “igar rabat,” the troubles. When I first
                    got there, or shortly after I got there, was when our ambassador there and econ
                    counselor were murdered. And that's when the embassy closed its operations,
                    leaving a skeleton crew. They no longer used any form of exit out of Lebanon
                    except for Damascus, so therefore over the next six months or so we became their
                    logistics pipeline. The bodies of our two dead diplomats were carried out to
                    Damascus and put on aircrafI think they were C-130which we had arranged to come
                    in on special dispensation into the airport to take them out. I stand corrected.
                    I'm not sure about that. The two aircraft did come in bringing armored cars and
                    we used them to pull out household effects that had been left in Beirut when the
                    evacuation occurred out of the embassy, which was just prior to that. The only
                    problem with the armored cars was there was absolutely no clearance into Syria
                    for them and we had to keep them in Damascus for eight or nine months, I
                    believe, before we could get enough documentation to move them into Beirut. The
                    cars were Ford LTDs and heavily armored. The irony of it was that they were so
                    quickly assembled, or quickly prepared, that they didn't even have sufficient
                    brakes to stop with all of the extra weight they had. When they finally went to
                    Beirut over the mountain, it severely hampered their ability just to get through
                    safely.</p>
                <p>We went to Beirut or into Lebanon twice, once through the embassy and once in an
                    attempt to get some equipment that we needed commercially. On the first occasion
                    we had maybe 20 people there overnighted. The second time when I went into a
                    different part of Beiruthe outskirts of BeiruI was very impressed. Always you
                    had Syrian checkpoints at that time; Syria had begun occupying the place more
                    extensively. On one occasion I was stopped by a Syrian and asked where I was
                    going and I told him, and he said, “Well, there's going to be a battle there in
                    about a half an hour.”</p>
                <p>I felt that was very nice of him to tell me that and I didn't go. (laughs) On
                    another occasion we were allowed from time to time to go into Shatura, just
                    across the border in Lebanon, to buy foodstuffs since we couldn't get a lot in
                    Damascus. Again, we had a few Syrian checkpoints and at one occasion came to a
                    Syrian checkpoint just on the other side of the border into Lebanon and there
                    was this sort of typical Syrian guard who looked like, “What the hell am I here
                    for stopping cars?” We came up to him, and he was one of my FSNs who had been
                    dragooned into the military four months earlier and there he was in the middle
                    of nowhere, stopping cars.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Also at the time, as I got to know my wife better and we became more involved,
                    she would frequently go home to Lebanon and she lived in the south not too far
                    from Sidon. To me it was always aggravating and very disturbing that she would
                    take these trips by taxthere was a very good taxi network between Sidon and
                    Damascuand she always said it was no problem. And even the days that Beirut was
                    closed, the taxis would veer off through the mountains in the southern part of
                    Lebanon to get to Sidon. She convinced mthis was after our Damascus tour, we did
                    visit her family in the soutaside from that, the situation in Damascus was
                    driven by the situation in Beirut. The hotels and houses were rented by Lebanese
                    trying to take refuge in Damascus. Hotels were full of Lebanese who had fled.
                    Obviously the richer would go to Europe or elsewhere, but a large number were in
                    Damascus. Our consular section was inundated by Lebanese trying to get visas to
                    America, which was very hard for theas were the consulates in Amman and Nicosia
                    and Athens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the burning out of our consulate in Aleppo.
                        Were we thinking of opening it up or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I don't think we ever were. The Syrians, at least as far as I could tell,
                    were very interested in seeing us return. On my visit to Aleppo, I had
                    frequently expressed to me their desire to see us return. What we were
                    interested in mainly was obviously to get recompense for the damage that was
                    done to the consulate. One of the interesting things was when we closed
                    relations in '67, or when the Syrians truncated relations, most of our FSNs went
                    on leave without pay until further notice; very few were left as caretakers in
                    Damascus. Since our consulate in Aleppo was destroyeburned ouI don't believe
                    anybody who was there was left to look over our interests. When I came there we
                    hired two or three FSNs from Aleppnot in Aleppo, but they had to work for us in
                    Damascus. One of them told me a very interesting story; he was in B &amp; F.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes, in Damascus. I'm not sure what he was in Aleppo. He said that in
                    Aleppo the day of the burning all the FSNs worked on the first floor, all of the
                    Americans worked on the second floor. When the mobs came out in front it got
                    very, very tense. And then he told me, “All you Americans scooted out the back,”
                    through a special ladder or a rope down the window, “We FSNs on the first
                    floor,” when they started throwing the gasoline bombs in the windows, “we had to
                    go out front and meet the crowds.” There was a certain amount of bitterness on
                    the part of how FSNs were treated and what the U.S. was doing to help them in a
                    situation which they, with justification, believe was not of their own making
                    but was because of their ties to America.</p>
                <p>Another FSN in our customs officour customs clearances guhe was in Damascus and
                    when the embassy was closed, he was taken and beaten severely about the head to
                    the point that he lost much of his hearing. A lot of them suffered a lot because
                    of Syria-America relations.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: We had one Vance visit and I guess it would be pre-Camp David. The most
                    interesting thing in respect to the Middle East peace that I recaland again, not
                    being in the political sectiois the Egyptian ambassador's residence was not too
                    far from our office, and where our office still is today. And shortly before
                    Sadat went to Camp Daviis my gueshe came to Damascus and Assad tried to convince
                    him to do otherwise. Obviously Assad failed. Within an hour after Sadat had
                    left, a bomb exploded on the front door of the Egyptian residence which
                    unfortunately for us is in the area in which we had a lot of houses. In fact one
                    man in particular had just missed being in the pathway of the bomb by five

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Ambassador Murphy is an extremely unified person. He had, obviously,
                    great experience, and I think he was esteemed by the people in the embassthe
                    Americans and the FSNs. He was just a very towering man, very impressive. That
                    was always conveyed to me. His DCM (Deputy Chief of Mission) was Robert
                    Pelletreau at the time. Again, both extremely nuanced, experienced Arabists. As
                    DCM he was an exemplary leader of Americans and I think in charge of making sure
                    morale of Americans and FSNs was kept as high as possible. I think he did a very
                    good job at that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel about Israel and relations with
                        Israel and all; I mean the lack thereof, or what have you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No. It was interesting in the sense of the two passport policy. We've had
                    a two passport policy that was extremely important, I think in terms of how we
                    related to Damascus. The Syrian immigration is very nuanced on checking on our
                    passports to see if we traveled to Israel a lot. On one occasion a person in the
                    embassy who went to Cyprus then went to Israel for personal reasons. Although
                    the Israelis, if asked, would not chop our passports in or out, the Syrians,
                    when you returned, were able to figure this out, and they would not let him back
                    in. This was just one day to day aspect of the relationship. I'm not aware of
                    any deeper currents at the time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the military presence while you were there; was
                        there an obvious Syrian army and Soviet connection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Only in internal security. When we had Vance comand I noticed it when
                    other dignitaries would come the road to the airport is maybe 20 kilometers,
                    maybe not that lonit's quite interesting when you drive out to the airport two
                    hours before a VIP (Very Important Person) is coming you begin to see along this
                    stretch of several kilometers the emplacement of internal security about every
                    quarter mile. They had an awful lot of manpower devoted to this. Syrian military
                    units were not pervasive, did not seem to be omnipresent there, except for
                    internal security. The farther away from Damascus you would get, the less
                    security would be visibly present. In Aleppo, yes you would see them from time
                    to time, but you wouldn't have that every street corner presence of a goon with
                    a submachine gun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impressiobeing GSO you'd be probably more
                        aware of this than mosof the Syrian economy? I mean how did the average
                        Syrian do there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: It would be my impression that it wasn't very well. I mean the average
                    Syrian was poor in the sense of being unable to buy an awful lot of foodstuffs.
                    The average Syrian, as well as Lebanese as I found, did not have adequate heat;
                    the price of “mazut,” diesel, the price of heating equipment was too high.
                    Clothes were reasonably cheap, primarily, as I recall, imported from Eastern
                    Europe. Medicines, were reasonably cheap although perhaps not for their income.
                    At the same time you had a very visible strata of well-heeled Syrians: Mercedes,
                    luxurious houses, exorbitant cost of land. Land was about the only thing that
                    was left in the economy that the government didn't regulate or own. Consequently
                    speculation on land and building apartments was a major occupation of people who
                    had Syrian pounds.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I went to language school at FSI one year and then the second year in
                    Tunis. This was the Arabic program.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What prompted you to?I mean you had obviously been there,
                        but did it take? Sometimes the experience in the Arab world does not
                        encourage one to keep going.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: It's flukish the way I opted for Arabic. As I've said earlier, I toyed
                    with getting into Chinese. I didn't get that much of a positive response from
                    EAP (Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs) at the time. It was possible but
                    it was going to take a lot of hard work. I made intimations of interest in
                    Arabic; my bureau was very, very interested and immediately moved to try to get
                    me to propose that I go into Arabic language school. I made a signal that I was
                    interested and almost immediately I was assigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. One goes where one is wanted. (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I had no appreciation of the history of the Middle East, very little
                    interest in the Middle East, but now I found myself in Arabic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did things progress with you and Daad? Daad worked for
                        the Association for Diplomatic Studies in its earliest days so we're old
                        friends. But how did that go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Shortly after she left Damascus we did get married. We had one marriage
                    ceremony in Beirut with her family in accord with the way one gets married as a
                    Shiite Islam in Lebanon, and then in 1977 we had a civil ceremony in America. So
                    for the last year of my assignment we were married. We got the impression that
                    the Syrians were no longer interested in harassing her or me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came here to Washington, how did you find the
                        Arabic training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: At FSI in Washington I felt that the Arabic training was mismanaged. I
                    always think of it as probably two months of instruction compacted into 10
                    months. It was a waste eight months of my time. I found it very, very
                    substandard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: One of the problems, which I'd encountered earlier in Indonesia, is that
                    in classroom settings the lowest common denominator generally runs the
                    class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>PIERCE: The one who wants to do less work, the one who is not interested in
                    following the structure. Inculcated within the teachers was a philosophy that
                    the student is always right, never correct a student. One of the oddest things I
                    found out at the end of my 10 months herit's only a 10-month courswas that I had
                    been going through 10 months with a basic assumption that was totally wrong, in
                    basic Arabic, a totally wrong assumption, and it was only my last week here that
                    one of the teachers dared to correct this basic mistake that I had been making
                    throughout the entire class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this FSI or was this Arabic Culture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: This was FSI. Area studies I found very, very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but I'm just talking about the lack of
                        correction.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: As far as I could tell it may well have been something easily graspable
                    by the Arabic teachers here, but it was guidance from management. Another thing
                    I disliked about this, which I did not know at the time, but certainly found out
                    in my subsequent Arab tours, most of the teacherand this goes to the dynamic of
                    how teachers are chosen or were chosen at the timwere Christian. Well, as you
                    know, the majority of Arabic countries are pervasively Islamic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: And Islam, while you may to some degree separate the religion from the
                    language, you can't do it in a real sense. It pervades the language. It is
                    totally within the language. Words are blurted out, responses are made based on
                    Islamic values. It had none of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is of course true not as much now but certainly
                        earlier in American thinking. If you didn't know the Bible, a lot of
                        expressions and all just didn't make sense. When I was a youth you pretty
                        well knew you had to know the Bible because everyday expressions were based
                        on the Bible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's right. Much the same issue here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Patience of Job” or what have you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Did you find it helpful having an Arabic speaking wife? Did she add her bit? I
                    assume she spoke Arabic around you?</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>PIERCE: She did. She does speak Arabic. She did to a degree, but primarily most
                    of my concentration was on the academic part. Obviously when you are a native
                    speaker and Lebanese, while it's not a dialect certainly is a version of Arabic
                    with a lot of expressions and peculiarities in terms of sound that are not
                    mainstream Arabic. She did to some degree but we never went intensively through
                    Arabic. When I went to Tunisia, however?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Tunisia from '79 to '80?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: To '80, yes. The language school there was in my impression a much better
                    example of how to teach a language and I learned a lot more. I felt that my time
                    was much more usefully spent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were getting Area Studies at FSI, this was the
                        post Camp David time and all. Did you find that there was a pretty good look
                        on the Area Studies at the Islamic world, Arab world, or not? How did you
                        feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I thought the Area Studies at the timand this was in '7gave a pretty good
                    critique of Camp David; pointing out its advantages and its disadvantages, its
                    defects. Iran obviously had just come into the news and at the time our Area
                    Studies was less aware and was scrapping around to find good academic expertise
                    on Shia Islam. Iran we had to handle historically or as an economic issue. It
                    was very ample expertise, but particularly with respect to the religion there
                    was little and it wasn't particularly good at the time. But by and large I was
                    very impressed by the caliber, which as far as I can tell, is maintained by what
                    FSI Area Studies has been doing in terms of the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well when you got to Tunisia?in the first place you were
                        with a class, I take it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your class; I mean sort of the background? The

                        would say, really basically disinformation trying to make the Arabists into
                        a class of people apart or something like that. How would you describe your
                        class?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>PIERCE: I'm trying to remember how many we had. The State Department people at
                    FSI in Tunisia, there were not a lot of us. It was a mish-mash. Most of the
                    State Department people were there because they just wanted the language. And I
                    think any sort of bent towards great interest in the Arab world was probably not
                    a major factor in the selection process that put these people at FSI in Tunisia.
                    I'd say by far we were a minority although we probably were more than anyone
                    else. But we had other agencies, most particularly the military that were
                    interested in using FSI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had a series of interviews with Hume Horan who is one of
                        our top Arabists and he was saying, you know, this idea that somehow
                        everyone fell in love with the Arab world and all of this, he said, “After
                        all, when you think about it, if you're working in an Arab world these
                        people, for the most part, are insulting you most of the time and they're
                        trying to kill you.” It's not the friendliest area to go to. It's a
                        challenge. It's unlike some of the romance?some of the Brits at least in the
                        olden time, you know, got out there with the Bedouin out in the desert in
                        the starry sky and all that. That's not an American trait.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: There are a few people I know to do that, but not by virtue of, or
                    because of, their experience at FSI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs) You were in Tunis at a difficult time,
                        particularly in the Islamic world because we're talking about the period of
                        the takeover of our embassy in Tehran. How did you find Tunis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: To me, again whatever happened at the political level, government to
                    government, I'm not aware of. This was the waninI presume it's the waning, I
                    forgowhile Bourguiba certainly was in the waning period of his career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes. He was almost senile.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>PIERCE: “Almost?” He was senile at the time. Still he had a very tight control
                    over what was put in the press and over dissent. He didn't care an awful lot.
                    Certainly you could see a very large number of unemployed youth. I didn't notice
                    any great political preoccupation by them, or any great amount of religious
                    fervor coming out from any real direction in the city of Tunis. It just did not
                    seem to be very consequential. Consistently, over and over again, in Tunisia, it
                    was made clear to us that they did not consider themselves in any great form to
                    be part of the Arab world. The language there is different from standard Arabic
                    and when we would speak to them quite often they would not understand. We
                    certainly couldn't understand their Arabic. Sometimes they would ask us to speak
                    French. On one occasion, one Tunisian shopkeeper said, “What is this tongue? We
                    do not speak this tongue here.” The food was different. Couscous pervades North
                    Africa; it's a far cry from Arabic cuisine. I had a real sense that their
                    Arabness was really not of seminal import to them.</p>

                        world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I do not recall any tension coming out of those events in Tunisia. The
                    Tehran incident occurred just as I was leaving, I think. I don't remember the
                    exact month it occurred in. It had no effect in Tunisia that I'm aware of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Qadhafi, was he a presence at all there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No, he was not. When I first got there FSI was basically taking tours to
                    Ghadames; I unfortunately did not take the one tour that went there early in my
                    tour in Tunisia, but I was going to take the second one. Well, between the first
                    and the second one our embassy was sacked and our relations went through a low
                    ebb. We no longer had a presence there. I seem to recall that tension between
                    the two countries geared up at that time and the border was closed anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Egypt? Was Egypt the place you went to to get a
                        different view or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I'm sorry, your meaning?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I was just wondering whether if you were going to go
                        try your Arabic out you'd go to Egypt or where. Where did you go on your
                        trips?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Well, the year before I was there each student was given a stipend and
                    told you had to travel in the Arab world to acclimatize. The year I was there we
                    went through a budget exercise at State and all of that was withdrawn, so
                    therefore I had no area training. I was considering going through Egypt,
                    probably into Yemethis was before Tehran and perhaps over trying to get into
                    Iran, but all of that became academic. There were no official trips; I took no
                    trips in the Arab world. I went around Tunisia quite a lot and also to Malta.
                    That's the extent of the Middle East that I visited during my stay in
                    Tunisia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting much advantage then? I mean if the
                        Tunisians said, you know, “Your Arabic is not our Arabic,” and you couldn't
                        get out and around, was there much advantage to being trained in
                        Tunisia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Tunisia, as I recall, was selected because there was no alternate
                    elsewhere in the Arab world. Once Beirut fell a decision was made to transfer
                    the institute somewhere else in the Arab world. The best candidate at the time
                    was Cairo, but Ambassador Eilts did not want to see an expanded presence there
                    anymore than it was, because it had ballooned at the time in Cairo, and there
                    were no other options. Tunisia was better than Washington. That's really about
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were getting nervous about the Arab world, particularly
                        after the Tehran business although it wasn't an Arab country, but I mean it
                        was still in the Middle East. Was there a problem in assignments when you
                        came out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No. I was assigned when I was in Washington for my first year of Arabic
                    and was assigned to be the political-military officer at the embassy in Jeddah.
                    That assignment was not broken, nor was there any attempt to get dependents out
                    of Saudi Arabia, while at the same time the rest of the Gulf, after the Tehran
                    incident and the reaction in Islamabad, I believe every Gulf state had to
                    evacuate its dependents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, with great screams. I've talked to people who were in
                        the Trucial states or in Oman or something, saying there was really no
                        threat but this was just Washington covering its ass in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: This was not an unusual situation. That was exactly the impression we got
                    in Jeddah at the time. There was an attempt to do it in Jeddah. The Saudis let
                    it be known, as I understand it, that they would greatly appreciate it if we did
                    not do that and that security in the Kingdom was at an all time high. Our
                    ambassador there was John West whom I'm sure made the case articulately in
                    Washington, and Saudi Arabia was not evacuated.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1980 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: 1983.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation iit was Jeddah then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there? I mean the situation in Iran was
                        still very hot, at least from our point of view, and I guess from the
                        Saudis' point of view, too. You had a Shia revolution of considerable
                        magnitude boiling off on its eastern border, or almost border, and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: There were a couple of things. Firstly, although assigned as a
                    political-military officer, that slot was abolished and I became political
                    officer at the embassy. My specialty was internal affairs. The events that you
                    suggest, especially the Shia incidents in the eastern province, but more
                    importantly in late '79 the armed takeover of the mosque in Mecca.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. When did this happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I think it was in late '79. It had caused an extreme amount of tension
                    and concern in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes, just before my time. And the primary concern outside of the fact
                    that it was such a tremendously staggering eventhis is what triggered the
                    reaction in Islamabad that you mentioned earliewas that the accusations against
                    the royal family seemed to make them very vulnerable: corruption, siding with
                    the West, and basically not being good Muslims. And it caused an immense amount
                    of concern over their stability and the regime's stability.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>One of my jobs was to travel to various provinces and to see what I could as to
                    how stability was, whether there was an economic largess or economic gains that
                    were being made outside the glossier big cities where people almost always
                    focused. So this is what I did for most of my three years there. Take forays
                    primarily into the north, north of Riyadh and north of Jeddah. Also some into
                    the south. Number one, to look for signs of progress, and, number two, progress
                    economically, commercially, and socially. And whatever suggestion about the
                    politics of the place. The other job that I had, in that sense, was to follow,
                    to the degree you could, the royal family and to try to get some idea as to just
                    how cohesive or not, uncohesive, a fuse they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For me, I had a little time in Saudi Arabitwo-and-a-half
                        years in Dhahran, but this goes back to '58 to '60 so things have changed.
                        But also the people I've talked to really talk about Riyadh, Jeddah, and
                        Dhahran and that's it. The fact that you got out and arounlet's talk about
                        the north. What were you seeing up there, because I'm not even aware of any
                        particular cities or settlements up there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Well, it's easier to go into Riyadh and go north of Riyadh. The first
                    place you look at is the province of Al Qassim, the towns of Buraydah and
                    Unayzah. This is the area which in the past, in the '20s, spawned a group of
                    Islamic fanatics called the “Iquan muslimin,” Saudi version, which in essence
                    ultimately revolted against King Abdul Aziz and were crushed. This is the area
                    that we had the riots against television in the early '60s, I think. A prince
                    was involved in this and was shot and killed. Ultimately his brother ended up
                    being the one who assassinated King Faisal. It's the most conservative, most
                    extreme area in the kingdom. It is the area also that the plotters of the
                    assault on the mosque in Mecca in '79, were from. That area I went to a few
                    times. Just north of that is Hail, which is at the base of the great Nafud
                    Desert which stretches northward towards Jordan. I went there a few times. There
                    was an interesting prince who was governor there and I found him a very
                    captivating man. Trying to see what he was doing in that place. This was the
                    competitor of King Abdul Aziz. Ha'il was the capital of the Al Rashid family
                    that in essence ruled Saudi Arabior what is now Saudi Arabiuntil Abdul Aziz was
                    able to take it back from them. I went there several times. And just a little
                    bit farther north on the other side of the Nafud is Al Jawf which is in the
                    Hinterlands; this is more traditional, ruled by a Sudairi at the timI think his
                    son still ruleheld much like a chieftan. And just to the north of that on the
                    border with Jordan and Iraq was the northern province, northern borders, Al
                    Hudud ash Shamaliyah, and it also had a prince from a cadet branch of the royal
                    family ruling there. And it's the long stretch of province that borders Iraq and
                    Jordan going down towards the gulf. The capital there is Ar Ar. Always trying to
                    find out just visually what was going on. The Saudis were extremely mistrustful
                    of foreigners. They did not like us to travel, they would never talk politics to
                    us. I just tried to see how grandiose the projects were, what were the schemes,
                    what were the programs. Trying to travel as much as possible, sometimes with
                    minders, sometimes without minders.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: From the governor's office to help you. Yes. I found out from time to
                    time that they were quite good. You'd get them to start gossiping about their

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, what about accommodations there? I
                        mean this is not a place where tourists go or foreigners go.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No. There are no tourists in Saudi Arabia, or there weren't at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you be received? Would it be sort of hotels or
                        what have you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Buraydah had a decent international style hotel with a decent buffet and
                    decent central air conditioning. Ha'il was a little bit more primitive. Jawf you
                    stayed at the guest house of the governor, and in Ar Ar you stayed at a
                    substandard hotel. The farther north you went out of Riyadh, the lower your
                    accommodations became. Khasid was going through a tremendous amount of
                    prosperity. This was at a time that the Saudis were subsidizing wheat to an
                    extreme degree and farmers in Khasid, through government loans and giveaways,
                    were able to extract fossil water and were producing wheat in tremendous
                    qualities. I think Saudi Arabia was in the top five in terms of wheat production
                    in the world by the time I left in '83. The policies continued on into the '90s
                    and I don't know what's happened to it. It was very wasteful; the water was just
                    being frittered away. The wheat produced was several multiples higher in terms
                    of cost than wheat in a wheat-producing country would be. But it was part of
                    Crown Prince Fahd's desire to see Saudi Arabia self-producing in food, which is
                    an immediate spring-off of the '73 OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting
                    Countries) freeze of oil and the occasional threats that came out of this
                    country. Out of America in terms of, “Well, they cut off our oil, we'll cut off
                    their food.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had these schemes, but some of the other places
                        weren't producing wheat. How was money distributed? My impression is in the
                        old days the king would come by, hand the ruling sheik, or whatever it is,
                        so much money or marry a daughter or something like that and drift away, and
                        then that sheik would then distribute the money.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>PIERCE: You've got two things here. Firstly you've got a bureaucracy that makes
                    sure that the king's word gets promulgated. It's not only in the interest of
                    trying to help parts of these isolated pockets of the country, but also to
                    promulgate your own profession as a bureaucrat. One of the things you just said
                    is very interestinI've always thought thiis that in the old days we did have a
                    king, Abdul Aziz. He owned everything and he gave things away to people. The
                    country didn't own anything. There was no real sovereignty invested in the
                    people. That concept continued. You could see it simply in the way the press
                    reported that grants would occur if something happened. If there were a flood,
                    the king would give money to the victims of the flood. If there were a project,
                    the king would announce the granting of money for this project. Continually
                    everything was phrased and thought of as coming from the king. Now behind the
                    king obviously you have the consensual family, and the king's authority. It's
                    not solely vested in the king, but the king as selected by perhaps the ruling
                    elders of the family, who are looked upon with great veneration or as having
                    authority by the rest of the family. In other words, always an attempt to
                    maintain the cohesion of the “Al Saud,” the family of Saud. That began to have
                    holes in it over this period of time, but it still was an institution, which I
                    imagine it is with a lot more holes in it today, that was cohesive enough, and
                    revered enough, that it would succeed. When King Khalid died in 1982, I believe,
                    and Crown Prince Fahd became king, the more traditional way of selecting the
                    monarch through more consultation and consensus was in part short-circuited.
                    This suggests, perhaps, the beginning of an erosion of reinforcing the
                    institution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the north? What was sustaining them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Basically major grants from the central government. Each region had a
                    budget and then I think above and beyond the budget you had a lot of special
                    programs where you could get loans, where you could get land. Through the
                    provincial government and through the central government, individuals could do
                    that. One of the things that you continually hear is the holding of the
                    “majlis”. You know what the majlis is.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically it's a tribal council.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Where you've got the ruler; the local potentate opened to anyone of his
                    subjects, male, who could come in and make petition of him. This is a major way
                    in which funds are doled out. But in other ways it's always a constant,
                    entreaty, of the man who holds the keyin other words, who holds the revenuebe it
                    a local level, be it official, be it unofficial, at a national level. There's
                    this constant barraging of requests through to the man and it's doled out that
                    way. Plus you had the regular programs. You have five-year plans that are
                    announced, you have annual budgets that are announced, and you have we are going
                    to build a massive health system. You might even identify the more isolated
                    areas of Ha'il Province, for example, that are going to get their new
                    hospitals.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>The same thing is going to be true of communications, of roads. I found out, by
                    and large, that roads were there throughout the north, that communications were
                    googood telephone facilities in isolated villages in which not much existed.
                    They were just there and you saw no signs of economic activity coming out of
                    these places. The dusty roads between Riyadh and Jeddah, for example. Or going
                    up fifty or a hundred miles outside of Ha'il. Water was available. Massive
                    conversion was underwaalthough at that time it wasn't even close to completioof
                    desalted water being provided to the country. Ten or fifteen years later it was
                    a much more visible presence throughout the kingdom. But I think there was a
                    very, very pointed attempt by the Saudis to assure that the fruits of largess
                    were being dispersed to Saudi nationals. That said, of course the royal family
                    and those closest to them were several tiers higher than the average Saudi. You
                    looked constantly for poverty and yes, you can see signs of it, but it's very
                    difficult to put your finger on. You also looked very carefully at how nomads
                    are being treated, and by the time I was there the institution of nomad was just
                    about coming to a close except perhaps for the Al Murrah in the empty quarter of
                    the southeast.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes. Although the problem with nomads is the government had tried very
                    specifically to settle them, because settling, in the government's mind, was a
                    way to civilize them and give them prosperity. This had begun several years
                    prior to my coming and it was an open question as to how successful that would
                    be, although there were beginning to be signs that it wasn't working well; that
                    you had people who lost their anchor, so to speak. Who did nothing gainful, who
                    were even more on the dole than they would've been had they lived independently
                    out on the deserts. Ultimately, they were just basically losing their sense of
                    local identity.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: No, I didn't. In the capitals you always had them. Beyond the capitals I
                    think it was a hit or miss situation. It was very difficult. You never could get
                    good reliable medical statistics; you never could geand I don't know if you can
                    today evesolid statistics on population. I think the Saudi government failed
                    several times to conduct an honest census. So you never really could get a
                    feeling as to exactly what kind of medical attention you would get if you were
                    200 miles from Ar Ar. I daresay you wouldn't get much. It just wasn't there.</p>

                        they had the great infusion of Koreans, Indonesians and Pakistani come. Who
                        was doing the grunt work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: When I was there, what was the nationality of choice? They were beginning
                    to look at Pakistanis; the Thai had out-priced themselves, the Koreans had
                    out-priced themselves, certainly the Turks and other Arab countries like the
                    Sudanese had out-priced themselves. What the Saudis would do is they would go
                    into tapping through labor contracts from various countries. And once you got
                    the group in there, and as their price went higher, then you would look
                    elsewhere. I think the Pakistanis, at that time, were on the favored list. The
                    Indians had lost out. The Pakistanis were always viewed despicably, by the
                    walooked upon in extreme distaste. And the feeling was reciprocal. They were
                    later to be replaced by Bangladeshis and Indonesians. Filipinos also were in
                    there somewhere. It just depends; it depends on what period of time as you go
                    through. We tried to get estimates of just how many were around. I don't even
                    remember what our estimates wernot as much as the Saudi population, but not
                    insignificant.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Rarely. Foreign workers mainly lived in compounds. They were bussed to
                    the site of whatever construction or whatever plant they were in. They would be
                    pervasive in the cities on Fridays, market days, where they had nothing to do
                    and the employer would let them go. They were not visible, not much sign of them
                    outside the major cities, with some exceptions where you have particularly large
                    projects. When you go to the special industrial cities like Yanbu, you see
                    foreign workers. They're quite visible. But 10 or 15 miles away you don't.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: There was never any visible military presence in the kingdom unless you
                    specifically went to places where they were positioned. In other words, this is
                    in the case of two tours of mine. My first tour I went to no places like
                    that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I did not. The southeast was not an area that I was responsible for. Did
                    I ever go down at all? That was an area that we split off and gave to another
                    officer. Jizan, Najran, and the Asir, although I did go to the Asir. That issue
                    was one that made its way into my focus on my return to Saudi Arabia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The problem with looking at potential internal problems is that you tend
                    to take what you get and magnify it too much. There was always a dichotomy
                    between the Hijaz and the Nejd between Riyadh and Jeddah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Nejd being the central part.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The central part where the Saudis are from. People in the Hijaz felt
                    themselves more sophisticated, were far more civilized, and basically
                    dispossessed by the Saudis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were a lot of the major merchant families.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Merchant families and people of great religious background coming from
                    Mecca and Medina. As you might recall, many of the merchant families are either
                    Yemeni or from Persia four or five, 10 generations ago, and mixed in with the
                    Hijaz which always has been a sort of an open door for access to Mecca and
                    consequently has a hodgepodge of ethnicity to it. But there was a dichotomy. You
                    could feel it. You could sense it. And resentment. Now to say that this was
                    really a major focal point of contention that would split the kingdom would be
                    ridiculous, but it was there.</p>
                <p>Jeddah has always been a prime focal point of Crown Prince and King Fahd, who
                    made palaces there. A lot of corruption was there as well. But it enjoyed a
                    prosperity commensurate with its tradition, its past. It was the preferred place
                    of residence for most Saudis who had education and could afford to stay there
                    professionally, although Riyadh outdistanced it, I think, ultimately. There
                    wasn't a great feeling of, again, political tension there. You'd get problems in
                    Mecca and Medina, and why you do is that over the years, prior to '83, the
                    Saudis allowed Islamic dissidents to stay in these cities. And as long as they
                    kept their noses clean they were tolerated and accepted there. I always felt
                    that there may be a certain sort of potentiality although you never could see
                    it, never could sense it coming out of the Hijaz because of this. Refugees from
                    the Muslim brotherhood in Syria, from Yemen, and from Egypt were basically
                    allowed to live rather freely in Mecca and Medina. In Mecca primarily, but also
                    in Medina, you had large numbers of illegal immigrants who lived there for years
                    and from time to time you get Saudi officials saying, “Well we're going to clean
                    up the immigrant problem in Mecca [or Medina],” and from time to time they might
                    even try to do so, especially around hajj, but ultimately it never worked. They
                    were primarily Africans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Africans used as workers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Most Africans were overstays from the hajj, and not to any great degree.
                    Chadians hajj for some reasothousands of them. Medina has since the early '80s
                    up through the mid-'90s, been a major construction site. It always had in it
                    apparently a Shia population, but trying to fight it was very difficult. Between
                    Shias and Sunni Muslins ultimately you got an intimation that they had ties to
                    Iran. The problems in Medina were exacerbated by the Iranians over the years,
                    but starting that early.</p>
                <p>Iranian Shia always trying to politicize the hajj, ended up finding Medina a
                    place more convenient for incidents. In the mosque in Medina you have the
                    Prophets' tomb and traditionally the Iranian Shia wished to venerate tombs and
                    graves. There is a grave site, cemetery, in Medina called the Ka, I think. On it
                    is a great sign that said, “Do not venerate these graves,” and you could not get
                    in to the cemetery. When you would have visiting Iranians on hajj, they would
                    also go to Medina and many of them would attempt to venerate the Prophets'
                    tomb.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>In all mosques, especially in the prominent ones for tourism or for religious
                    pilgrimage, you have a bureaucracy of very large unhappy looking Saudi
                    bureaucratic religious officials. Their job is to make sure that the proper
                    tenets of Islam are followed. Whenever these Iranians were there during hajthis
                    is always what happenethey would begin to be perceived as venerated prophets too
                    and it would become a great fight. And this would constantly happen in Medina.
                    It wouldn't happen to any great extent in Mecca. Mecca was a place where
                    Iranians would try to demonstrate for the Islamic revolution and the Saudis
                    continually tried to suppress these so-called demonstrations. This also
                    occasioned an incident or two. At the mosque in Mecca, when you do “kaulof”
                    circumambulate the Kaabyou look at people from a whole variety of nationalities
                    and many of them are in extreme ecstasy.</p>
                <p>There was once ona very black Africawho, in part of his ritual small pilgrimage,
                    the “umma,” he went close to “Kiswa,” which is the black drape around the Kaaba,
                    and he basically was flat up against it in its embrace. This is duplicated in
                    the hundreds of thousands of people. It's very difficult to turn a group of
                    people who speak no common tongue and who are there to go through the peak of
                    their spiritual and physical lives; it's very difficult to politicize that. And
                    when you have a thousand or five thousand Iranians committed to a political
                    demonstration, it gets lost in all of that when you have another two hundred
                    thousand people who are not interested in that at all and very easy to
                    contain.</p>

                    me and he said, “Are you Muslim?” and I said, “Yes,” and he said, “Okay,” and
                    that was the only so-called problem I ever had. I went in to Mecca. When the
                    hajj takes on full force the city ultimately closes down. The Saudis attempt to
                    limit the number of cars there and you end up finding yourself parked several
                    miles out and being bussed in unless you are really a super VIP. I never went in
                    beyond during that period of closure. It becomes a monstrous mass of people and
                    you're in there for religious purposes only. I did go in the day before, once,
                    before it did close, and walk through the mosque and around the city, observing,
                    and this was a time when the Iranians would try hard for a political
                    demonstration. The conclusions I gave you before about people in ecstasy, people
                    who speak no common tongue, or people who were there simply for this peak of
                    their religious life, I concluded then that the potential for major disruption
                    or for making contagious the political message of Iran was very, very low.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to before you were at the takeover of the
                        center of Mecca, was this done by the Iranians? These were not Iranians who
                        did this; these were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No, as I made allusion to earlier, these were primarily a group
                    spearheaded by an Islamic group with ties into Kassi, into the very tribes that
                    revolted against Abdul Aziz in the '20s for being un-Islamic. Who really thought
                    that the Mahdi had returned in the form of this person and that the age of their
                    version of Armageddon was coming. It's a very abhorrent form of Islam. And I
                    think extensive research into the background of these people and whatever ties
                    they may or may not have had revealed nothing. It was a home-grown group of
                    abhorrent cultists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. In the area you were covering in the North and the

                        How they were dealing with the people and the stability of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I thought that the family, during this time in which they had unbounded
                    revenues, made a very conscious effort to distribute wealth and to deal with
                    problems. Unfortunately most of that was throwing money at them and throwing
                    money away, but it was still there. At the same time corruption was
                    pervasive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would corruption manifest itself?</hi>

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Corruption manifested itself in the skimming of profits. Corruption
                    manifested itself in payment of bribes, and in the commissions that invariably
                    went along with all major projects in one form or another that were accomplished
                    primarily by foreign business. Invariably a foreign company or a Saudi company
                    will not have a contract with the Saudi government without sponsorship and
                    someone close to, or a member of, the royal family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. And so there's not room for?there is the payoff to
                        the member of the royal family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: There is the payoff. The payoff can be 10, 15, 20 percent; when you're
                    talking about a $10 million project that gets to be enough money probably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, one always hears about these palaces that are
                        around there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the role of the palace? You would think one or two

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I found it was an exorbitant fascination, particularly on the part of
                    Kind Fahd at the time, to have palaces. When you burst into this valley that
                    Medina is iit's in a beautiful valleand you come over a ridge, it's sort of a
                    hill that you can go over, going up the coast you're slowly elevating until you
                    get to the altitude of Medina. So this valley appears and off to the distance on
                    the left side is this tremendous mountain and at the top of that mountain is
                    this construction and it looks like a palace that you could see in Cinderella.
                    Walt Disney's Cinderella sort of stuck on the top of this mountain. That's King
                    Fahd's palace.</p>
                <p>It has this road winding up it and on top of that is a helipad. It's a very
                    impressive palace. One of his multibillion dollar palaces. Tracking where Crown
                    Prince Fahd was over the three-year period I was there, he spent a total of
                    perhaps six days in that palace in three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did these contribute anything outside into the pockets of

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I don't know the answer to that question. You'd have to presume that,
                    given the way business is conducted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I was just thinking that, you know, you have these
                        palaceI suppose there's a retinue that lives there or something like
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>PIERCE: One of the interesting things I found out about another prince, whom I
                    will not name, is that he had on his payroll 12,000 people. Now, what this
                    meanthis was his personal payroll, his personal retinues. I'm trying to remember
                    if they were being salaried by the ministry or not. He provides the wherewithal
                    for 12,000 people, and were he to stop the phenomenon, he had 12,000 people out
                    of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. And of course in a country like Saudi Arabia where
                        the population is small, this is not an inconsiderable number of
                        people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: It is not an inconsiderable number of people. I think you could see this
                    duplicated across the board. It is a form of subvention and monumental
                    entitlement that becomes part of how things work. Trying to convert that into a
                    system of modern bureaucracy or trying to clean it up you would produce an awful
                    lot of fissures, social fissures, as you did that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of contractors, right now one of our major
                        problems in the United States is Osama bin Laden.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes, I know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The bin Laden family was a major family, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The bin Laden family is a major family. Ever since the first king, King
                    Abdul Aziz, began building his kingdom, he's always had around him contractors
                    or people who will build for him that he trusts. The monarch had always done
                    this, and normally it's a good relationship between the two. As I understand it,
                    bin Laden, the father, was in this position and was, in essence, the major
                    contractor for the modernization of the city of Medina multibillion dollar
                    contracone of King Fahd's pet projects.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes it did. It was quite a disturbing development. One in which the
                    Saudis were fully supportive of our initiatives. As you can guess, or you might
                    know, the Iran-Iraq War was one which did not directly affect the Saudis, but
                    Gulf security was of extreme importance. They were highly supportive of our
                    attempts to keep the Gulf secure and safe for the egress of oil, and for
                    commercial traffic.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the new breed of Saudi who were
                        coming out, particularly out of American universities and all? You know
                        getting trained in the United States and getting quite respectable
                        educations and coming back. Did you find that the system was absorbing them
                        in a fairly efficient manner or were they building up a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: From what I could tell, the system absorbed them in a fairly effective
                    manner. You could find them in all sorts of positionhigh positions in ministries
                    as well as in commerce. The fear or the hope at the time was that this liberal
                    education that these Saudis would receive would in part have a positive effect
                    on the more rigid, conservative approach found there. I did not find this to be
                    the case. In most cases when a Saudi returned to the kingdom, he, or in some
                    cases she, would immediately revert to and be a staunch upholder of traditional
                    values, a staunch defender of the Saudi model of social and economic
                    development. The Saudis, over the period of the '80s, had begun constructing
                    many universities. They did this in the '70's. It was in the '80s that they
                    began to cut down on scholarships and approvals for study overseas, since “we
                    have our own perfect system.” Ultimately it would be a major negative. Yes, they
                    could hire the best educators in the world for the universities, but you would
                    always question their standards simply because it's very difficult to have a
                    Saudi fail. Secondly the positive aspects of education overseas, while it did
                    not have a major impact on social policy, ultimately you would think that it
                    would. Therefore, this sort of containment of education was seen as a
                    negative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the treatment of women by the Saudis? Was this
                        sort of a burr under the Saudi-American relationship at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No. I don't think so. There was always a tendency on the part of
                    westerners to presume that women in Saudi Arabia are in extreme distress over
                    their second-class status. And indeed it is quite confining, yet from what I
                    could see during that period of time, the women in Saudi Arabia, by and large,
                    in large measure, did not feel the need for greater freedom in the kingdoI just
                    don't think so. Most womewe're talking about women of meangot their frustrations
                    out or got their freedom to the degree they wanted it by extensive travel
                    abroad. Yet at the same time I didn't sense that people who were sequestered in
                    Riyadh felt any great sense of freedom when they went to Jeddah. It just wasn't
                    part of the culture.</p>

                        and very much a negative as far as terrorism went. The recruitment from the
                        Islamic world, including Saudi Arabia, of what you want to call freedom
                        fighters, “mujaheddin,” or what have you, against the Soviets. Was this
                        apparent to you at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Very insignificantly. Obviously the Saudis were wholeheartedly behind our
                    policy in stopping the Soviet Union. Very prominent was the gathering of private
                    funds under official auspices to aid the mujaheddin fighters in Afghanistan.
                    Beyond that, in the early '80s, there was no overt sign of much beyond that. I
                    mean the Saudis were strongly committed towards stopping Communists. That's what
                    this was all about. In that period of time the fear of communism, which was a
                    fear inculcated mainly by King Faisal to a tremendous degree, but even earlier
                    than King Faisal, and it was still very, very strong in the Saudi mindset.
                    Consequently, it was then natural for them to be very supportive of our policy
                    of trying to kick out the Soviets, and also to do their own thing from a
                    religious side to the degree they could.</p>

                    trust had the ear of the president, and that's the reason why Ambassador West
                    came there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because Carter of course had been the governor of Georgia
                        and they both talk southern.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: They both talk southern and West was a very sort of traditional man, very
                    country gentleman, filled with anecdotes. He constantly liked saying that we've
                    got the same traditional valuethey revere family values just like we do; they're
                    just like people at home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way there was at a certain level a concurrence.
                        You know, I mean two greatly different cultures but?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No, I agree. Being from Georgia I can understand the point and I can
                    understand the message behind it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the feeling? You were there for a while
                        with West. Was he getting the message across?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>PIERCE: He was getting the message across. He had very good contacts. One of the
                    things I used to do was translate presidential correspondencletters from the
                    king to the president. I wouldn't presume to translate English into Arabibut one
                    of my jobs was whenever we had to get in touch with the king, we'd use a man in
                    the palace in Jeddah. That always worked well. Then whenever I had to get in
                    touch with the crown prince, the ambassador had a very special relationship with
                    the crown prince through his office, through his special assistant, and the
                    crown prince was always available. The oil minister was always available. Other
                    key ministries were always available and it was a constant, I think, back and
                    forth dialogue which continues. It was very obvious during the Gulf War and
                    during the war with Iraq and when I was there in the '90s, but I think we've
                    never had a communications problem with the Saudis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Saudi ambassador in the United States at the

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The man's name was Faisal Alhegelan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was later replaced by Prince Bandar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that was later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I don't remember exactly when Bandar took over. Maybe by '83, I'm not
                    sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, we can talk about that the next time around
                        because at least my interview with Hume Horan was that he felt that Bandar
                        was not a positive influence. I don't know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Bandar, before being ambassador, and certainly while ambassador, was
                    readily available here in Washington, and before, in Saudi Arabia. AlthougI've
                    met Bandar onche had a habit of disappearing for long periods of time whenever.
                    (laughs) I mean for whatever reason; sometimes it seemed politic as far as he
                    was concerned.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I had more experience in dealing with that when I was the
                    political-military counselor in Riyadh.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, we'll pick this up the next time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Was there much social intercourse with the Saudis during off-duty hours and that
                    sort of thing?</p>
                <p>PIERCE: Not really. I was able to develop social ties with about two or three.
                    Other people who had served in the kingdom 10, 15 years earlier, used to speak
                    of how easy it was to have social intercourse with Saudis and to meet their
                    Saudi wives. I knew one Saudi familan entrepreneumet his father. I may have met
                    his wife, I don't remember. For some reason I got attached to him. He was trying
                    to convince the kingdom to build a state-of-the-art oil spill containment
                    operation. A very impressive man. I also knew another Saudi who was a
                    businessmamet his Egyptian wife and his family and had several contacts with
                    him. These are the only two that I knew in a more relaxed, just social,
                    environment. Although you would meet young Saudis from time to time, you would
                    meet Saudis at official functions, and I also had a different set of contacts or
                    approaches in Riyadh during the Gulf War, during the war with Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1983 is there anything else we should discuss do you
                        think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: About the kingdom?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: One other thinand this is just an observatioI studied very carefully the
                    royal family and I also studied, to the degree I could, the religious
                    establishment. One of the things we were interested in there was an upsurgthe
                    beginning upsurge at the timas King Khalid was an interim king anyway. He was
                    there to be supplanted by King FahFahd did a lot of the decision making for
                    Khalid. But there was an upswing of religious strengthardcore, Wahhabi strengtin
                    the kingdom, which had persisted although I don't know what the state of it is
                    today.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>It was my theorand I could see this happeninthat when you had a king who was
                    strong in religious values, who had a good religious education and was
                    incorruptible, or could make the case that he was incorruptible, he was in a
                    position to subvert, to twist, and to dominate the religious side. King Abdul
                    Aziz, the founder of the kingdom, was that way. When you had a king who was
                    overtly corrupt, pliant, and not religiously educated, the religious people took
                    a swing up and became more present in terms of policy making, which you could
                    see happen under King Saud. When King Faisal took over from King Saud, he had
                    more of the qualities of King Abdul Aziz and the religious leadership went into
                    eclipse. King Faisal was assassinated and King Khalid came in. Khalid was not
                    particularly corrupt in the real sense of the word, nor do I recall him being
                    any great Islamic scholar, but Crown Prince Fahd certainly had an image more
                    closely resembling Saud, I think, in the common view of things, than say Faisal.
                    And you could see the religious infrastructure beginning to take more control
                    over social policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this “alumna” or whatever you pronounce it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Well we worried more on the upswing which is always the foreign
                    preoccupation in Riyadh, or in Saudi Arabia, of the “mutaween,” the volunteers,
                    the religious believers. But also the sense of the steps taken to curtail girls'
                    education, the steps taken to assure that women remain in a secluded place, the
                    steps taken to make it more difficult for expatriates to live, in terms of
                    fasting during Ramadan, basically just hardening of religious attitudes. And
                    these things seemed to get stronger when Fahd took over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to monitor this? I'm just wondering how as a
                        political officer, would one monitor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I had some very good contactnot Saudiwho followed the religious
                    leadership very closely. And one monitors this by paying attention to the
                    promotion list or who is promoted into what positions in the Ministry of
                    Justice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of criminology in a way. (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: More or less. Then you find out where this fellow fits in, the approach
                    and the attitude, or you find out what he's spearheading in terms of trying to
                    get through certain policies, or how he participated in a certain “fatwa”
                    (religious edict). You might recall that when the Saudi military did assault the
                    mosque in Mecca to get rid of the abhorrent takers of the mosque, they had a
                    fatwa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a religious?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>PIERCE: That's an opinion issued by prestigious religious leadership, most
                    prestigious. And you look at who signs these things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of like a Papal bill in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: More or less.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of a different nature, but the basic thing is this
                        is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: When I was in Jeddah before there was a religious moderate of immense
                    learning who had been promoted highly by King Faisal, and then under King Khalid
                    he had been shunted off into a sinecure and his position had been supplanted.
                    His successor, in terms of religious influence, had a more conservative bent. He
                    was a very interesting man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I think this is probably a good place to stop. We'll

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: (laughs) I was known for someone whose assignment sheet went to hell.
                    Khartoum kept coming up as empty and I wanted a place to go. I didn't know what
                    the hell I was getting into.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes. I left Jeddah in 1983 and was transferred to Sudan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Sudan until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to Sudan the embassy was located in
                        Khartoum, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes it is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem getting the assignment, or was this
                        sort of here you are an Arabist and you'd obviously played with the desert
                        and so you were acclimated and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: At the time the political section chief position in Sudan was not being
                    filled. It was an O-1 position, I was an O-3 at the time. It was continually
                    advertised.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “advertised”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: For assignments. No one was interested in it. When my original bid list,
                    which certainly did not include Sudan, fell apart, in a peak of frustration I
                    let it be known, after seeing Sudan open, was there any interest in me and I was
                    assigned there within 24 hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the corridors and in the Arab circuit did Sudan have a
                        reputation, or a plus, minus, anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Over the years that I've been associated with NEA (Bureau of Near Eastern
                    Affairs), countries along the fringe of the Arab world are hard to fill. There's
                    always a tendency on the part of the desk to say, “Well it will hold you in good
                    stead. This is an Arabic assignment,” etcetera, etcetera, and, “It will increase
                    and broaden your experience.” Well it certainly does that from a straight
                    functional aspect. Learning about Sudan certainly helps you understand more
                    about the Arab world to a degree, but in the sense of bolstering your
                    credentials or giving you a broader sort of portfolio, in mainstream NEA it
                    never really had any effect at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Sudan was somewhat on the periphery of NEA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: It wasn't even on the periphery. It was barely on the scope. One of the
                    key issues that you can see in Sudan, in respect to Egypt primarily, is that
                    Sudan is not the source of most of the Nile water, but most of it is coming out
                    of Ethiopia through the Blue Nile. But it has a tremendous impact on the water
                    downstream. Therefore in the long run it is a critical issue for Egypt's
                    survival. Yet, in looking at the cable traffic over those two years and from
                    what I could glean in terms of attitudes in Egypt, as far as NEA was concerned,
                    yes, it was an important issue but not anywhere close to driving the NEA list of
                    priorities for Egypt or North Africa.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Internally. Those two questions are intertwined.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The key issue for Sudan at the time, although there were a lot of side
                    issues that seemed to be more important, was internal stability. In the summer
                    of 1983, Nimeiry, who had been in since the '70s, maybe even earlier, had over
                    the years slowly corrupted the system which started out in a so-called
                    semi-democratic mode, so that he became the autocrat in charge of government. He
                    had been in position to co-opt and to divide, to segregate, sometimes arrest and
                    fire, people who earlier on were seen as his equal. He behaved as a primus inter
                    pares, to the effect that he alone made decisions. And he made some very bad
                    ones.</p>
                <p>Basically his actions had alienated the south starting a few years earlier. It
                    had always seemed to have been in his mind ultimately to utilize resources from
                    the south for the good of the north, which is basically the Arab north versus
                    the black south. He had begun to take these steps. Most notably he had incurred
                    sufficient anger amongst southern soldiers in the military, that in the person
                    of John Garang they began a small movement known as the SPLA (Sudanese People's
                    Liberation Army), which ultimately was to take on extreme significance in the
                    south as an insurrection or resistance movement. Just as I had come there it was
                    not quite so obvious how that was going to work. Ultimately it worked quite well
                    for the resistance in the south. Also, shortly after I got there, he began his
                    long and somewhat twisted enamorment with Islam to the effect that he began a
                    series of steps making Sudan an Islamic state, the effect of which is still
                    quite visible today.</p>
                <p>The country was economically a basket case and, as I recalI'm not an
                    economisthere was no positive forecast when I got there, and it worsened as I
                    continued on, through mismanagement and extreme Sudanese cultural policy from
                    the very beginning. Whenever you think of Sudan today, as well as then, its
                    grinding poverty, natural disasters, political disasters, military disasters
                    always beset the country. When you would think that Sudan couldn't get any
                    worse, it did. And this apparently continues.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: We had a very close, strong relationship with the Nimeiry government. The
                    official approach that the embassy had adopted, and was adopted in Washington,
                    was that Sudan, being so large, so mammoth, was key to stability across a
                    significant portion of Africa. Looking at every country that Sudan touches, you
                    take in a large part of the land area of Africa. Consequently, were it to turn
                    unstable, it could be seen as a source of ready instability that could affect
                    other countries. It was looked upon as having the potential of great
                    agricultural prosperity. It reminds one of the turn of phrasSudan is a country
                    of the future, it was always a country of the future, and it always will be a
                    country of the future. But we had a very strong interest. We were very close to
                    the government in all aspects. We had a close military relationship, modest
                    given the state of security assistance worldwide, but close. And there was also
                    ready access to the highest circles of government.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: He was a strong proponent of the American-Sudanese tie, and was keenly
                    interested in giving as much support to an obviously weakening central
                    government as possible, simply because I think the cost of it failing was very
                    difficult to comprehend on our part. He was very proactive, which I think is his
                    reputation, and looked for a constant need for trying to find ways to bolster it
                    politically and economically, and through a large aid program.</p>

                    of course, most foreign policy initiativealmost all of thewere under the
                    ambassador. The bilateral dialogue with the head of government with the various
                    ministers was very, very closely followed and spearheaded by the ambassador,
                    which is as it should be. I was in charge mainly of looking at internal
                    stability, cultivating disparate views, and there were beginning to emerge more
                    outspoken personalities at the time, and also doing the day to day foreign

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The first DCM was Jack Davison who later went on to be ambassador in an
                    AF country I forget. He was replaced shortly after I got there by David
                    Shinn.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: David was an Africanist. I think Jack was as well. David went on to be
                    ambassador in a couple of placeI think most recently Ethiopia and he's just
                    retired.</p>
                <p>The other side of the storthe international aspects of this at the timwhich
                    helped obviously solidify our approach to Sudan is that it was reamed with
                    difficulties. Reamed may be too big a word. There was the very strong resistance
                    in Ethiopia, especially the Eritrean resistance movement. On the other side
                    there was the Chadian war, the Chadian rebellion, which was on and off all the
                    time, and then of course Libya with its long-time extreme fascination with
                    Sudan. Oftentimes Libyan attempts to undermine stability there, to create
                    national resistance movements within Sudan and in effect to try to bring off as
                    much instability in the country as possible.</p>

                        How did you deal with, in the first place, the Nortthe Arab portion? I mean
                        these are the ruling people.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Well, firstly, there's a qualification here. The so-called Arab portion
                    is mainly Arab oriented. They are of mixed descent and as it came to be known to
                    me over a period of time, they thought of themselves as being looked down upon
                    by Arabs because they were Africans, although so-called mainstream Africblack
                    Africantended to see them as Arabs. They were a mixture. While Arabic was the
                    lingua franca of the north, and to some degree in the south, almost always as
                    far as I can recall, North Sudanese were not raised initially on Arabic, but on
                    a local dialect which I don't believe there were a lot of Semitic features to.
                    You had ethnic groups cross the north, but they all had a common bond of being
                    so-called Arabs, of speaking Arabic in great degree, and of being Muslim which
                    set them off from the south, which, although there's a tendency to look upon the
                    south as Christian to a degree, to a large extent was animist, and very
                    definitely part of black Africa. Several, several linguistic groups thermany of
                    them mutually antagonistic.</p>
                <p>And then, geographically, topologically, the south had a distinct, decidedly
                    different aspect. The north was dry, the north was quite arid, not unlike the
                    Sahel, basically desert and rock. The south was in large degree a slough, the
                    point where the White Nile river basin and adjoining rivers ran through a large
                    flat plain and created a tremendous swamp. That's the reason why it was so hard
                    for European explorers to penetrate the source of the Nile from that direction.
                    And with the very tip of it, southern Sudan, being very verdant, not unlike
                    Uganda in some waa very, very beautiful lush area; equatorial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this '83 to '85 period, was there an actual war going
                        on between the north and the south or was it a subliminal level of
                        violence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Shortly before I got there, as I said, a colonel of some stature in the
                    Sudanese military was so alienated by Nimeiry's policies in the south that he
                    basically deserted and began forming the SPLA. I think prior to that the south
                    was always permeated and penetrated by local gangs, and weapons were
                    increasingly easy to obtain. Suddenly the SPLA became first among equals amongst
                    these gangs; and with an announced political position was in a position to
                    capitalize on Nimeiry's stumbles. Most notably the announcement of the beginning
                    of implementing Islamic law in Sudan.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Sharia law. Their version of it; it's not Sharia law. It was certainly a
                    tremendous boon to the growth of the SPLA. Within a very short time the SPLA or
                    related gangs, with very, very quick ease, cut off two of Khartoum's major
                    initiatives in the south. There was an attempt to straighten the White Nile with
                    a gigantic cutting wheel that was going to vastly increase the amount of water
                    going up north, ultimately into Egypt, and bring abouin somewhat perhaps
                    questionable forecastan agricultural revolution in the south. It was a gigantic
                    wheel under contract of a French firm but it was attacked. As I recall perhaps
                    several people were killed. The Europeans were able to get out safely after a
                    lot of close brushes, but the project was in effect dead.</p>
                <p>Farther north on the border between South and North Sudan on another riveagain an
                    area of the White NilChevron was in beginning exploration mode for oil drilling
                    in the area. A very sensitive issue since earlier attempts by the Khartoum
                    government, i.e. Nimeiry, to take the area affected and redraw the map making it
                    part of the north. They had a large ferry positioned on the river which was
                    their base camp, and in the middle of the night a group of armed resistance
                    leaders, or gang, got onto the boat, killed several of the expatriates there and
                    basically shut down the operation. So very quickly two promising projects for
                    the future were put on hold. Indefinitely in the South, more likely forever; and
                    in the North, temporarily, which was to last two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this sort of “Damn you up in the north, no matter what
                        you do,” or was there a purpose in these attacks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's hard to say. Whether at the time there was enough cohesion within
                    southern resistance to see a grand design. Following, over the two years, the
                    ebbing and flowing of combat, of attacks, sometimes you'd get the impression of
                    cohesion, other times you didn't. Certainly over the years it's obvious that the
                    SPLA had primarily Dinka tribesmen at its head, although it reached out and
                    sought to embrace other significant tribes. Nuer and Shilluk which were closer
                    to Ethiopia and farther north than Dinka. You never got the impression of how
                    totally cohesive they were within the SPLA cause, simply because of the ethnic
                    issue of Dinka versus other significant tribes. It was very difficult to put a
                    finger on it. There were Nuer and Shilluk that you could meet in Khartoum, but
                    the predominant Africans that were there that were political contacts were
                    either Dinka or, on the other side of the coin, from the far South. From
                    Equatoria. The equatorial area was filled with large numbers of tribeseveraand
                    there was no predominating people from Equatoria.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>In large part, Nimeiry co-opted southerners in the '70s to become part of his
                    regime and was oftentimes in position to use them to give his regime a sort of
                    legitimacy throughout Sudan. By and large, by the time I got there in '83, the
                    vast majority of these co-opted southerners who were still within the government
                    were equatorial. Very few from the heartland of South Sudan, very few Dinka,
                    Nuer, Shilluk, although they were significantly seen throughout the city. One of
                    the things I did in cultivating the opposition, or in trying to talk with people
                    holding disparate views, was to cultivate ties to ex-politicians, mostly
                    southerners at the time. I found very attractive, very articulate people with,
                    in many cases, a very broad view of what the problem was in Sudan. Most
                    preeminent amongst them was a man named Abel Alier who had been Sudan's vice
                    president at one time. He just had extremely good vision about the problems that
                    Sudan was going to face. At the time it was more difficult to find northerners
                    who were outspoken about Nimeiry with the ambassador. Ambassador Horan wanted
                    very much to cultivate other political types who were in or just around the
                    government, or who was in opposition to it. And with his name I would set up
                    meetings which he and I would go to, most notably with Hassan Turabi who at the
                    time was not in government and was reasonably sharp and critical of Nimeiry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we trying to act as an intermediary in maybe an

                        fellows, get your act together” or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's a hard question to answer. I did not have any dialogues with
                    Gaafar Nimeiry and you know our policy in Khartoum in terms of its internal
                    affairs was set by Gaafar Nimeiry and no one else. His vice president, the
                    deputy prime minister Omar al-Tayib, had little influence, as far as I could
                    tell, over how he managed internal affairs. Wagain, I never dihad frequent
                    meetings with him. I'm not sure how much of an impact any dialogue that we had
                    with him made on the overall approach. But I think there were some attempts to
                    steer Nimeiry or to question him, to probe the wisdom of his policy, but he was
                    hell bent. Also he was a survivor essentially. He had gone through the
                    revolutionary councils and one by one the other partners were weeded out and he
                    had twisted and turned and shaped personalities within his government so that he
                    was the one who knew how to handle things in Sudan. It was very difficult, I
                    think, for anyone to convince him of anything regarding the wisdom of how he ran
                    the internal politics of the country.</p>

                    leaving, was a massive shortage of food mainly in central West Sudan, across
                    Sudan, which was internal. And as I was leaving, AID was in the process of
                    setting up massive supplies of food. Now the Eritrean refugee issuthe one that
                    got all the prominencwe had an awful lot of special delegations, primarily from
                    Congress, coming in essence to look at the Eritrean imbroglio. But it had little
                    effect on stability or on politics. I do know something about it because we did
                    have a refugee officer who later got into some notoriety as I was leaving and my
                    wife worked for him during the Eritrean crisis in the refugee office. They also
                    had a number of refugee officers on TDY who came out and stayed in Khartoum for
                    long periods of time. People were dying; it was a tremendous tragedy. But it was
                    not a focus that I had. It had really no political effect except along the
                    immediate border, and also obviously our relationship with Sudan and with
                    Ethiopia at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about along the Red Sea and towards that area of
                        Sudan, what was happening there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Well, this again was near the border with the Eritrean homeland and a
                    favorite point of where refugees came out, where many of the groups who were
                    interested in kicking Ethiopia out of Eritrea had contacts and some supplies. So
                    that was the main issue along the Red Sea, south of Port Sudan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Sudanese government playing any role in the
                        Eritrean-Ethiopian war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I touched on that very slightly. There was some support that was allowed
                    by the Sudanese, but it was an issue more associated with Ethiopia than it was
                    with Sudan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that the head of refugee operations for us
                        gained some notoriety. What happened there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: This is the famous evacuation of Falasha Jews out of Ethiopia and the use
                    of Sudanese airfields to cart them off, which occurred in April or May, of 1983
                    and was done apparently with the okay of Gaafar Nimeiry and was facilitated in
                    large part by the refugee officer in concert with other offices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this cause any political ripples within Sudan when it
                        became known?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Ultimately it did. In the waning days as Nimeiry began to get weaker and
                    weaker, this issue was just one more that his critics used to make the case that
                    he was unable to rule and was erratic. It was also seen as making more obvious
                    what had always been the casyou always heard Sudanese say thithat he was a tool
                    of the U.S., and of Israel, and therefore no longer should be running the
                    country. I think it also had the effect of making it more difficult for
                    Nimeiry's friends in the Arab world to come to his defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about relations with Egypt at this time? Is this
                        something that we were watching?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: We always watched it, especially from Sudan. It was quite obvious to me
                    over the years that Egypt has always been the Sudanese big brother, has always
                    been in a position to try to guide Sudafrom time to time perhaps not so
                    skillfully and looking awfully clumsy in trying to impose its guidance on Sudan.
                    Then at other times to be more cautious when some of their actions look
                    excessive and they run the risk of hurting the relationship. It struck me
                    shortly after I got there, once when Mubarak came to visit Nimeiry, Nimeiry gave
                    an address to the speaker of the house in Khartouthe legislative bodand it was
                    interesting because you saw Nimeiry giving the speech and behind him, one step
                    up on the podium, was a place where other people were sitting and behind
                    Nimeiry, almost immediately over his head, was the big, large face of Mubarak.
                    It seemed to me to sort of tell it all. The relationship went up and down, and
                    the Egyptians quite often were very cautious and worried that they would strain
                    the relationship too much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Libya? I mean this must have been something
                        everybody was looking at.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: From time to time, there would be so-called Sudanese resistance, or
                    Sudanese opposition to Nimeiry, who, because they had no other way of expressing
                    their opposition, ended up in Libya and were trained, funded, and ultimately
                    came back to carry out whatever wicked plans they had cooked up. Quite obviously
                    these were purely initiatives funded by Qadhafi, even to the degree in many
                    cases that the so-called formation of these groups was not spontaneous at all. I
                    am not aware of how close any of these so-called operations might have come to
                    success. There were a couple of attempts against our embassultimately they were
                    basically neutralized. It didn't seem that it was a very competent group of
                    people.</p>
                <p>This whole intrigue issue with Libya started off much earlier. Libya had always
                    been seen as a source of refugSadiq al-Mahdi, who was president in the mid-'60s
                    and deposed, used Libya as a refuge for a long period of time. This is one
                    reason why Sadiq, who was certainly around when I was there, was looked upon
                    with great suspicion by Nimeiry and for most of the time was in jail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression and maybe the embassy impression
                        of Nimeiry at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>PIERCE: That's an interesting question. I think the embassy was interested
                    primarily in assuring our continued relationship with Nimeiry because the
                    consequences of his elimination were difficult to envision. At the same time it
                    became increasingly apparent that Nimeiry was more and more erratic and losing
                    touch with reality. Furthermore, that this was being reflected by most Sudanese.
                    That attitude was just very pervasive. You could see in this in terms of looking
                    at Nimeiry and his characteristics. His fascination with Islam persisted
                    throughout the two years that I was there until he was toppled in, I think, May
                    of '85.</p>
                <p>He began to embrace a form of Sufism. Sufism is very strong in Sudanese Islam and
                    that began to invade and taint his policies. He elevated a number of so-called
                    Sufi leaders of not great repute in local circles to become his palace advisors.
                    They had little or no political imagination whatsoever. He instituted a new
                    constitution for the country in which he calls himselthe term in Arabic is
                    “Ameer El Mo'omineem” the prince of the believers, which is a title more
                    relevant to the 7th-century than it is to the modern world. In essence, despite
                    his protestation that the south had nothing to worry about in terms of Islam, he
                    began a step-by-step process of making them worry even more about what the
                    position of the south would be under Islamic Sudan, and also making more people
                    worried about his sanity.</p>
                <p>The other thing he did was his so-called implementation of Sharia law, which to
                    him was Islamic punishments, most notably, the cutting off hands for thievery.
                    Shortly after I'd gotten there he'd outlawed alcohol, had a big ceremony
                    throwing several hundred bottles of booze into the Nile River. And indeed it
                    dried up. Then he began to study and ultimately implement the Islamic Sharia
                    law. Once it was fully implemented it was taken on with a real passion. There is
                    a major prison just on the outskirts of Khartoum, which I seem to recall was
                    circular or it might've been square, in a plain area, and in the middle of that
                    there's a yard and they constructed a large platform and off the top of the
                    platform was going to be the place that you would implement Sharia law. This
                    came to be ultimately a Friday showplace, where anyone who had been caught and
                    sentenced under Islamic court which he had set up, by Islamic judges that he had
                    set up with a little training in Islam, where the hands would be severed. On
                    Fridays you would have thousands of people gather around the prison to view the
                    severing of hands. And it got to the point that the platform had to be raised
                    higher so that the more people who came in on Fridays to watch could have the
                    view. And at least on one or two occasions, if not more, every Friday as the
                    hands would be severed, the severer or a functionary in that group of office
                    would take the severed hand and parade it around the wall. This was an extreme
                    great sport for people who came to watch on Friday.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Another interesting part of this was the execution of Mahmoud Mohamed Taha who
                    was called an Islamic brother. He had been a thorn in Nimeiry's side since even
                    before Nimeiry took over in his coup. He's always been an Islamic revolutionary
                    who was interested in seeing more of the ecumenical aspects of Islam, looking at
                    greater toleration, and over the course of years had developed a theology of
                    Islam that was not mainstream. He was always a sharp critic. At the time he was
                    70-years-old there was a decision made that he had to be arrested, and he was,
                    and charged with apostasy and convicted in one of these special courts in
                    Khartoum. A 70-year-old man for his apostasy and his heresy was convicted and
                    sentenced to deatthat was death by crucifixioand the saving grace under this
                    Sudanese criminal process at the time is that they were not going to crucify
                    Mohammad Taha, the 70-year-old man, at Kober Prison. What they did was they took
                    him out and they hung him and after that they were supposed to hang him on a
                    cross and let his body stay there for a period of time. Apparently Nimeiry
                    wasn't, as I recall, in the city at the timhe might not have been in the
                    countrand after they hung him some of his two Sufi presidential advisers were
                    there and the prison warden was going to bury him and the little Sufi advisors
                    came up and said, “But you can't do that; you have to hang him on the cross,”
                    and to his credit the warden said, “No, we've done enough to Mr. Taha. We don't
                    need to do any more.” And he was not left hanging for a while on the cross.</p>
                <p>The human rights situation in Sudan, specifically, was unimaginable. I had done
                    human rights reports in Saudi Arabia and at the time just shortly after they
                    were implemented I felt they were a waste and a bother and a nuisance, and put
                    myself in a reasonably good position to defend the way the Saudis approached
                    their version of human rights at the time. But it was looking at these excesses
                    and just the sheer disregard for human dignity that changed my entire attitude
                    on human rights. The human rights movement was not sufficiently advanced enough
                    to make this a strong source of pressure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While this was going on was there any diminution of our
                        contacts with the Nimeiry government? I'm thinking particularly from
                        Washington or anything like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Not that I'm aware of. Ironically our long dialogue with Nimeiry
                    culminated with his visit to Washington for a Reagan meeting just as he was
                    losing power. In fact the day he fell he was on his way back from that
                    Washington visit. Again, I think throughout this time there was pressure, on
                    Nimeiry, in dealing with the South, and to some degree in terms of human rights.
                    But we were always met with, “I know what I'm doing,” and “I've been around.” It
                    seemed his emphasis on Islam was a pretext to cover his human rights violations
                    so he would just move on to something else. And we did have a busy bilateral
                    relationship with him in respect to what we would like to see with Egypt, to the
                    general Arab agenda, to Chad, and to Eritrea-Ethiopia, and to Libya.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember around 1948 or so Sudan was the crown jewel in
                        the British colonial system. Really the top colonial officers went there.
                        The Sudanese people responded. I mean it wasn't all British; it was the fact
                        that they had a very receptive group of leaders and all that. By the time
                        you got there in '83, had that all collapsed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The erosion of all of that began in the '50s, after Sudan became
                    independent and it was just a very slow grind down farther and farther;
                    political ineptitude, economic grand schemes that never workethe gigantic cotton
                    schemes that never worked. The horrific amount of world bank loans that had been
                    given to Sudan were obviously part of all of this. By the time I had gotten
                    there, and for some years before, Sudan had been seen as basically down at the
                    bottom. The infrastructure that the British had built up as late as '56, well,
                    after 25 years you've got to do something to it to keep it running. In essence
                    there wasn't a lot of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about the people? Was there an educated class

                        did they have any role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Oh, in the sense of my contacts, the oppositiothat's what you first look
                    for. You look for the educated southerner who is a lawyer, you look for the guys
                    who spent time in Saudi Arabia or in Egypt and had been educated there, the
                    politician who was a grantee three years previously in America. These are the
                    people you find. Some of them move very educated, yet there was no sense of
                    common purpose in toppling Nimeiry. The way he ultimately fell was through a
                    combination of economic mistakes and riling up sectors in both labor and
                    students at the same time; ultimately as he was just collapsing.</p>
                <p>It was very strange because the day that he left to go to America the ambassador
                    had already gone bacas all ambassadors wilfor a presidential visit. I went out
                    with the charg�, David Shinn, to go to the airport to see Nimeiry off. I was
                    going to stand in back and Nimeiry was going to go shake hands with all the
                    ambassadors and with his ministers and leave. Well, the city had already started
                    having problems. The students were in the streets, and there were labor
                    problems. The airport is sufficiently close to town, not that far away. I'm
                    standing near our car while all of the ambassadors line up and the ministers are
                    out there, and Nimeiry drives up. In the background you can see puffs of smoke
                    coming from the city where cars are burning in the streets. And they stand
                    around and then Nimeiry comes up. He comes out in dark sunglasses with a
                    turtleneck sweater on, goes and jokes with all of his ministers, and this smoke
                    is coming up behind him, and then he finally gets on the plane and flies ofnever
                    to come back.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>It was just a very, very stark, unimaginable situation to me. Then we drove back
                    into the city, which was slipping farther and farther into a ruinous situation.
                    The telling event was when the electrical workers struck, consequently shutting
                    off Khartoum's sporadic electrical supply. When the judges announced that they,
                    too, would join the electrical workers in a massive demonstration in the middle
                    of town immediately other groups joined the opposition, which was growing by the
                    day, announcing that they, too, would join in the demonstration. This was to
                    happen on a Friday. It was on a Wednesday, I believe, when it became obvious
                    that this was going to occur. And Nimeiry's vice president had already announced
                    that he would shoot them all in the streets. There was a parallel between this
                    strike situation and the situation in 1958 where the then elected president was
                    topplealmost an exact replication. We sent a cable in saying that Nimeiry's
                    chances of containing his government looked very slim.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he was meeting with President Reagan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The cable was received two hours before his meeting with the
                    president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: President Reagan, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: (laughs) It didn't matter. I think my cable would not have affected
                    anything. The situation had changed so dramatically when the massive amount of
                    people went on strike, and were determined to have the demonstration. When that
                    all coalesced within three days before the event announced for Friday, the
                    coalescence was so pervasive, we knew it was not going to be a typical crisis
                    like those Nimeiry had weathered in the past. There's been some speculation, I
                    think, that had Nimeiry been there he might've been in a position to save
                    himselto save the regimbut he lost power because he wasn't there, and his vice
                    president had not been chosen because he was a leader. Nimeiry had basically
                    weeded efficiency out of government, so there was really no one of sufficient
                    skill to manage such a situation. Now, as you might know, on the Friday, that
                    night basically, there was an in-house coup. A revolutionary command counciI
                    seem to recall five top generalhad decided to take over the government. There
                    was no demonstration the next day. The city was dead. Nimeiry tried to get back
                    and was stopped by Mubarak in Cairo and has never set foot in the country
                    again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say the military could stop iyou know once you
                        crank up a demonstration, I mean were they able to go out and say, “We've
                        done it?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Nimeiry's gone. You don't need to demonstrate. I think there was some
                    popular uproar in the city, but no massive protests. It wasn't that difficult, I
                    think, to get the leaderships of these various groups to agree that the reason
                    why they were demonstrating was Gaafar Nimeiry, and Gaafar Nimeiry was no longer
                    there.</p>

                        disposition of Nimeiry happened when? And when did you leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: It happened, as I recall, in May. I could be off a month. It might've
                    been in June, but I think it was May. I left in July.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had been looking, as one does, I suppose, particularly
                        in a country where you've got a one man government, you take a look at the
                        military to figure out who these guys are and if you can get to thebecause
                        they're the most likely people to knock a guy off. Did we have any feel for
                        who these people were, where they were going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: It's a very slow road, obviously, building up contacts that can give you
                    insights into an issue like that. I think I had a reasonably good appreciation
                    of what every element of the embassy was thinking in this respect, but I also
                    was in a position to develop my own outside capabilities. But the answer is we
                    didn't know that concretely. I think by and large what you hathe CINC, or their
                    version of the CINC, the commander-in-chief, the head of military there,
                    Suar-el-Dahab, who had no ambitions whatsoever. That was a reasonably sure
                    thing. In that country just like with every other position, Suar-el-Dahab got
                    his position not because he was a dynamic leader; he got it because Nimeiry
                    thought he was malleable. A lot of the other senior military had the same
                    qualities. In other words, that's why they were put into their positions. But
                    you had some indications that there may be some undercurrents or different
                    agendas. At the time the general consensus was that these guys were in a tight
                    spot and didn't know what to do. They could see the entire country falling into
                    chaocertainly the citand the city was the country in the sheer sense of
                    politics. They moved to stop that from happening.</p>
                <p>It's a pretty reasonable assumption that the threat to shoot down the
                    demonstrators on that Friday by the number two, Oman al-Tayib, would not have
                    been carried out. There was a big question as to whether he even had the resolve
                    to see it happen. But if he had done it, it would've produced chaos and I think
                    the military leaders moved to forestall the chaos. Over the two months, and even
                    afterward as I recall, they gave no impression of having their own agenda. What
                    they were looking at was moving towards transitional rule. The other thing was
                    that they didn't have a nuanced grasp of foreign affairs or an estimation of the
                    threats around them. Their letting Libya open a new page in the relationshiin
                    other words, get close to thewas an extremely difficult issue and one that
                    destabilized the city, destabilized certainly our relationship with Khartoum.
                    Ultimately, as you might remember, it led to the installation of a little Libyan
                    friendship society in North Khartoum, I think, and ultimately into the shooting
                    of one of our employees at the embassy on the streets of Khartoum in the middle
                    of the night. And the evacuation.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember, just as a Foreign Service Officer, sitting off
                        God-knows-where, feeling no great love for Nimeiry because he let the
                        assassins leave.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Nimeiry's international approach had changed by the time I got there from
                    having a leftist tinge when he first took over and then he became allied with
                    more radical Islamic causes. He then evolved into being a close friend of
                    America, which he was at that time, with a demonstrated desire to stop Qadhafa
                    common bond with us. So we had a very different attitude. This earlier history
                    was always a sore spot, but the bilateral relationship had moved much farther
                    beyond his espousal of radical causes. He was very, very helpful and supportive
                    of us, and saw us as central to Sudan's future. Sudan is not unlike a lot of
                    countries, except that its size is so large and diverse. Not just the south, but
                    also the west, and the east, and the central south. All these areas, some with a
                    greater history of autonomy than others, had their own sense of identity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about personal security while you were there? Was
                        this a consideration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I felt no problems at all in Sudan, never. Except in the south, which I
                    visited in a UN (United Nations) plane three times, I think. And that was a
                    problem simply because the SPLA riddled the townespecially the town of Wau,
                    which I visited twicwith its own people and you just didn't feel overly secure
                    there in the middle of what's called the “tweesh” which is the flat slough of
                    the White Nile there. In a more professional sense, we were all very much
                    worried about security. There were, as I suggested, Libyan-trained Sudanese who
                    were avowedly planning to commit violence in Sudan against Sudanese targets as
                    well as American targets. So, yes, there was a security issue, but personally I
                    did not feel a problem.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I go back to my time in the late '50s when I covered

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Qatar at the time was seen simply as a backwater in the Arab world and in
                    the Gulf. It had potential natural gas resources. I believe at the time its oil
                    was beginning to level off or go down. It certainly was not seen as a place of
                    the future for oil. Natural gas, on the other hand was different. You had
                    extremely rich fields. But at the time natural gas was not a problem, not a
                    crisis, and our interest in their natural gas exploitation, was not very high.
                    It was sort of a non-descript member of the GCC (Gulf Cooperative Council), and

                <p>PIERCE: Not at all, but again, it was not of major consequence. It was a major
                    concern to any Arab government in the Gulf, but not a major topic in our
                    conversations with the Qataris.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I think the tank flagging became more of an issue when I moved into my
                    new position. I'm sure it did.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>PIERCE: The Omanis certainly thought so. As you know, Oman is not a member of
                    OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) and its oil production was
                    limited at the time and had little potential. It did not have the economic base
                    of the other Gulf states; it did not have the same Arabic identity as the other
                    Gulf states. It was trying to create an Arabic identity, which only began with
                    the accession of Sultan Qaboos in '69. A significant number of Omanis did not
                    use Arabic as their major language, their first language. That included the
                    sultan as well as the minister of state for foreign affairs who was one of our
                    closer colleagues. The use by President Carter of Omani landing fields for the
                    botched attempt to rescue our hostages in Iran without informing the Omanis had
                    caused a great crimp in our relationship. They also feared that our agreements
                    to upgrade their military bases for our use would ultimately turn them into a
                    parking lot for CENTCOM (U.S. Army Central Command), Tampa East.</p>
                <p>When I got in, we saw Oman as criticaand our access agreement with them as a key
                    to Gulf security, given our limited ability to get into the Gulf or use the
                    facilities in the Gulf in the event of a crisis. What we were trying to do was
                    to broaden the political relationship above and beyond simply a military one. We
                    had been viewing the bilateral relationship almost entirely in military terms;
                    we had no political dialogue with Oman beyond simply briefing them on what we
                    were doing on other issues in the Middle East, mainly Iran and Iraq, or the
                    Middle East peace process. The Omanis were very supportive of our attempts in
                    the Middle East, and more hesitant, but at bottom supportive, of our approach to
                    Israel-Palestine.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: They were most interested in that, but I think they were more cautious in

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I mean there wasn't a peace process as far as the
                        United States was concerned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No. The peace process I'm talking about is the Israeli issue, and they
                    were very supportive of our efforts there. They never posed any of the great
                    objections that you would see in any of the other Gulf States as to how we
                    conducted the peace process. On the Iran-Iraq War they were much more interested
                    in our assessment; they were far more guarded, I think, in the sense of what
                    they believed, simply because they felt under the thumb of threat with either of
                    the two sides.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>We had almost no economic relationship with Oman except an oil one, and no
                    assistance relationship. We had already begun certain things in trying to
                    broaden our relationship, and one of them was that we started a very modest AID
                    prograeconomic support funds (ESF). In essence we tried to modernize various
                    parts of their society, but it's very difficult to sustain that, and at the time
                    we were going through constant pressure to change priorities in terms of
                    security assistance as well as to cut. We'd also had earlier some military
                    assistance loans, but the Omanis were hesitant to accept more of those simply
                    because they were loans. While they weren't officially tied to the renewal of
                    our access agreements, they were always, by implication, tied to them.
                    Consequently, if we were to help more in terms of security assistanceconomic
                    support in this case, which does not have a military aspecor with military
                    grants, it was never spoken, but it was always difficult trying to work out all
                    of the details in terms of access agreementjust what we were supposed to do to
                    help upgrade their military facilities and what they were supposed to do in
                    allowing us the actual access into their military bases. That was a very touchy
                    issue. And basically less than two years into that job, I saw continued pressure
                    to reduce the ESF. In essence we were able to keep reductions down from 20 to 15
                    million, not a lot of money, but it was a victory even keeping that and not
                    getting it further cut. Ultimately I believe ESF was lost to Oman but then the
                    whole situation in the Gulf changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about relations with Saudi Arabia, because back in my
                        time the Saudis were not a very nice neighbor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Well, no one is really a nice neighbor to anyone else on the peninsula. I
                    mean Saudi Arabia had quarrels and quibbles with virtually every one of its
                    neighbors in the peninsula. I'm trying to think if it had some with Bahrain.
                    It's kind of hard maybe where that border is in the middle of the strait. I'm
                    not aware of any with Kuwait, but certainly with the UAE (United Arab Emirates),
                    with Qatar, with Oman, and with Yemen and PDRY (People's Democratic Republic of
                    Yemen) at the time. Yes, they always had problems. But there were also always
                    problems among the others. There was some confusion over the Omani-UAE border
                    and the fate of the Musandam Peninsula. The border between Dhofar, western Oman,
                    and PDRY had been worked out as I recall but still obviously big questions
                    remained between Oman and Saudi Arabia. But you'd get into that tremendous
                    “little war that wasn't” between Bahrain and Qatar over the Hawar Island and the
                    future of that relationship. And the constant lambasting of the Al-Thani family
                    in Qatar as being a bunch of nouveaus. Gangsters that the British had insinuated
                    into Qatar in the 1880s, 1890very nouveau. Then a recollection by the Al-Thanis
                    that the Bahrainis and the Al-Khalifahs used to be in Qatar until they were so
                    weak that the Al-Thanis were able to kick them out 70 years before the Al-Thanis
                    even came to power under the Brits. It's the nature of the beast there.</p>

                    country needed to move on, apparently with the help of the British. The

                    his son. [Inaudible] keeps chugging along in Bahrain; you know the old belief

                    of Oman, basically it had a pretty good chance of moving along because that was
                    the border adjacent to the PDRY.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen).</p>
                <p>I'm trying to put the date on the Dhofar rebellion; it probably was just before
                    Qaboos and just after Qaboos was in a position to resolve it. Qaboos' mother was
                    from Dhofar, he had a number of ministers from Dhofar. There was great interest
                    in Dhofar.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>PIERCE: I think they frequently had contacts with the PDRY, on a regular basis in
                    trying to make sure that the border stabilized and stayed stable. As far as I
                    know there was always a great concern, given the history of the PDRY and its
                    total instability and radical bent. But I don't think there was any sign that it
                    was exploiting instability into Dhofar or intended to do that. This was just
                    before the PDRY became more seriously engaged in on-again, off-again talks
                    across the border with North Yemen, and there was a lot of pressure from Saudi
                    Arabia. This was just before the flirtation about reunification, leading up to
                    what actually occurred over the next several years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No. In that office there was a public affairs adviser and I was the
                    deputy and there was one more Foreign Service Officer. There were three of us;
                    we covered the entire gamut of NEA affairs. I was more comfortable with the Gulf
                    and my boss was certainly more comfortable with the peace process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Arthur Berger, who had just come from being press officer in the embassy
                    in Tel Aviv, so he certainly knew a lot about the situation. I was more
                    comfortable with Iran-Iraq and didn't feel quite as comfortable about South
                    AsiAfghanistan and Pakistan nuclear issue. Regarding Libya we had an
                    anti-terrorist approach. We all were responsible for knowing sufficiently enough
                    about the bureau's issues that we could talk cogently and persuasively or write
                    about our policy, as well as give background to press queries from anybody on
                    any topic that we covered.</p>
                <p>The way the daily process works is that the Department press spokesman's office
                    would task the individual area bureaus to get answers to questions for the daily
                    briefing. Those taskings would come at about seven in the morning, and you
                    needed to develop guidances for the spokesman by eleven, eleven-thirty, or
                    twelvwhatever the deadline is. It's a very, very tightly-packed day. Many of the
                    public affairs bureaus would task these guidances out to the various offices in
                    their bureau. If it happened to concern something about Japan you would send it
                    to the Japan Desk and say, “Please give us an answer for it in Public
                    Affairs.”</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>We, by and large, wrote our own public affairs guidances and then let the
                    appropriate office in the bureau clear it, to make sure we hadn't missed a
                    nuance that they wanted to underline. Then it had to go through a rigorous
                    series of clearances up to the deputy assistant secretary level, sometimes in
                    various other bureaus, but certainly in our own bureau. That's a very tight
                    schedule, and deadlines in public affairs are quite strong deadlines. The press
                    spokesman can delay his briefing, but that is rare. The press spokesman would
                    review every tasking that we had. He or his deputy would hold meetings with the
                    deputy secretary of state who would put the final imprimatur on a piece of U.S.
                    policy on whatever issue was pertinent on that day. Then they would hold the
                    daily briefing. It makes for a very compacted and oftentimes frenetic day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of any particular issues that particularly
                        got you engaged? I mean I'm sure there were issues every day. Were there
                        ones that show the process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's hard to do. When the Intifada began in '88 or '89?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the first stone throwing, particularly of young
                        people, against Israeli troops within the Palestinian area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's correct. The problem with the Intifada was stones being thrown and
                    the response by Israeli troops first with live ammunition, then with rubber
                    ammunition. Frequently we would try not to become involved in condemning one
                    side or the other, or in a human rights situation or in response to specific
                    situations. In other words, we didn't want to condemn Israel for excesses, but
                    at the same time, as the Palestinian side became more and more amenable to peace
                    and was more interested in taking constructive approaches, we did not want to
                    condemn that side on its own. It's a complicated issue. Generally there was the
                    perception that we were reluctant to push Israel in a public way.</p>
                <p>With the Intifada we would try, when it became obvious that hard ammunition was
                    being used against what, in essence, amounted to teenagers throwing rocks, we
                    started pushing for guidances indicating that there was something wrong with
                    using live ammunition in these instances. Our language would get neutralized but
                    we kept pushing and ultimately I think it was obvious that we became far
                    stronger in our public affairs pronouncements on the use of live fire, and also
                    of time to time arbitrary use of rubber bullets, which also can kill.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>One of the things that we had to do was to look at the media all of the time. We
                    had CNN (Cable News Network) in our offices. One day at about four-thirty in the
                    afternoon CNN broadcast the story of Iraqi gas attacks against the Kurds in
                    Irbid and there were bodies in the middle of town. After we looked at that it
                    took us a while to get across to a very preoccupied level above us in the
                    hierarchy that this was important. Ultimatelit took some timby seven o'clock
                    that night we had begun to fashion our guidance basically expressing our
                    extremely strong reaction against the use of gas on the Kurds. When something
                    like that happens you're responsible to make sure it gets to the front office;
                    you're responsible to make sure they, who are normally preoccupied with a host
                    of other issues, know that this is a cutting issue and that we need to respond
                    quickly and decisively in reacting to it. You'd get to the front office and
                    you'd get the statement cleared there. Then you'd get that up to the press
                    spokesman, even at seven o'clock at night. You'd do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, going back to the Intifada, this was in a way
                        the first time I suppose you were up against I don't want to use the
                        pejorative term but, basically the influence of the Israeli lobby on our
                        policy wars.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No. It's not the Israeli lobby so much, but understandably when you're
                    involved in promoting dialogue and trying to move towards some type of
                    negotiation between two sides, you don't castigate one side and not the other.
                    You castigate both of them equallthat's the cycle of violence argumenor you are
                    more muted. Given our relationship with Israel there was always a predilection
                    to give the benefit of the doubt in terms of Israelis on the ground calling the
                    shots, or to look carefully when the facts suggested there was some egregious
                    issue that our attention needed to be called to. A good example of that is the
                    Security Assistance Act, where the issue of self-defense was always a factor in
                    what we supplied people or foreign countries. Whenever Israel would make
                    aircraft raids into Lebanon, by and large with our aircraft?</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That was not an issue that we had to work during my time in Public
                    Affairs. Those issues happened primarily in the early '80s.</p>
                <p>Another interesting area was Lebanon; I worked very closely with the Lebanese
                    desk. In terms of internal Lebanese politics, one side or the othemainly on the
                    Lebanese Christian sidwill always attempt to show themselves close to the
                    Americans. This is a prominent political dynamic in Lebanon. Quite often we
                    would learn about manipulation involving one side or the other, each trying to
                    position oneself to become president or to have a better policy or to gain an
                    advantage over an opposing side. Quite often I, with the Lebanese desk officer,
                    would work up guidance which did not address a specific issue, but which would
                    emphasize our position of basic neutrality and that we supported no one
                    parenthetically; lack of preference for any simple person or groulike this guy
                    who is exaggerating his ties with us. Now this type of guidance would never be
                    asked for, so what you would do is call up one of your favorite Lebanese
                    journalists and you would say, “If the question, whatever it is, were to be
                    asked today, I think you might have a story.”</p>

                <p>PIERCE: Yes. This was one of the first times that we started a program of trying
                    to bring out a public affairs policy that could be endorsed wholeheartedly by
                    the front office, by the U.S. government, well in advance of actual events. We
                    had very close coordination with DOD and worked out strategies to advance our
                    views.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Stark incident?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes, it was. (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that hit us? Could you explain what I meant by
                        saying “the Stark” and its repercussions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The Stark, as you know, was an American ship that was patrolling?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A destroyer.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>PIERCE: A destroyer that was patrolling in the Gulf. We got word of the Iraqi
                    planes dropping a bomb that hit the Stark on a Sunday?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually it was a missile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Oh, yes. It was an Exocet. We got word of the incident on Sunday, and I
                    was called in to the task force, starting I guess about seven o'clock that
                    night. We worked for the next 18 hours on Stark, in essence trying to craft a
                    public affairs strategy to use on Monday morning as well as to field queries.
                    Information was quite sparse throughout the early part of the nighwell, quite
                    sparse throughout the whole night. At around two or three in the morning I was
                    able to begin to craft what we needed to say to answer press queries and to have
                    a framework for dealing with this. I'm an FSO-2 at the time, thinking about what
                    we ought to say and what the people who will review it will accept. By say
                    six-thirty in the morning someonChuck Redman for example, who was the spokesman
                    at the time, or the deputy assistant secretary - will wander in to the task
                    force and ask what's up. You'll have this in front of them so that they can
                    begin to consider what other aspects to this issue, or other approaches, you
                    need to take into consideration. You make changes, so that by seven or eight
                    o'clock in the morning you have something fresh that the spokesman can begin
                    using, though not in any official briefing. Later in the day, you're going to
                    have official policy that addresses the issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think it points out one of the interesting and
                        often overlooked things about American policy. I mean long-term policy is
                        long-term policy, but so much of what we're doing is reacting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you're really at the raw cutting-edge of starting the
                        policy process in Public Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's true. The interesting thing is that you start with the short-term
                    but you always have a long-term premise in mind. Now that long-term premise may
                    be one that you inherited from statements that go back into time. Our approach
                    to Jerusalem, our basic idea of dialogue in the Israeli-Arab peace issue. Or one
                    that is just beginning, but will have a long futurand that could be our two flag
                    policy, that could be our approach to the Iran-Iraq War. Often you will begin to
                    think these things through and then you'd go and talk to the deputy assistant
                    secretary involved in the issue, or the desk director, or the person you think
                    has the initiative. You began to get maybe a different nuance and incorporate
                    that into the way you want to work things. But yes, you'd begin to slowly evolve
                    the policy, in a way that interacts, obviously, with how the principals want to
                    deal with the issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>In terms of producing a long-term policy I got the impression that it's very
                    difficult to say on any given day what our policy is on anything. You've got a
                    good feel for it, but until someone in authority actually says it, that's not
                    our policy of the day, because there may be a nuance change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just the way that we were sitting around reading who was
                        standing where in the Kremlin and so on in the announcements in the Soviet
                        newspapers, I mean it's got to be quite hard to figure out what the Soviets
                        were up to, but there were other people who were looking at us trying to
                        figure out what we're saying about things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: You have a general idea. The advantage of our approach is that we're
                    consistent; we don't change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I mean, over a period of time you can begin to inject a nuance or the
                    deputy secretary can inject a nuance, or you can have an event that will change
                    things dramatically, but our blessing here is that there is a basic consistency,
                    a basic tenet, in almost all aspects of policy. It will change visibly if it's
                    going to change. I mean it's not going to be subtlsometimes it happens that way,
                    but?And then the nuance issue or how things develop, as in the Intifada, or as
                    in the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) becoming more and more open to
                    dialogue and ultimately a partner in the peace process in the late '80I saw that
                    happen. These are significant shifts, but they're all grounded in the continuity
                    of our policy in supporting peace, in trying to get a dialogue going and in
                    trying to get terrorism out of the equation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now again going back to the Stark, as I recall we more or
                        less came down that this was an error rather than a deliberate policy. It
                        made sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's correct. It was an error. There was no other reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It didn't make any sense at all; some Iraqi pilot had gone
                        nuts.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>PIERCE: We've got several things we would approach on that issue, but it's not a
                    very complicated issue. Tragic, yes. Complicated, no. Number one, it's an error;
                    number two, the Iraqis have apologized; number three, they had promised to pay
                    for the damages; and number four, our position on the war between Iran and Iraq
                    is unchanged. Those would be, as I recall, the tenets of the guidance. A number
                    of variations would be applied, but those are your basic tenets. They've
                    apologized, they will pay the damages, we're investigating obviously, our view
                    on the Iran-Iraq War is unchanged. This is what you stick with. And you can
                    answer just about any questions the press is going to come up with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about India-Pakistan; what was happening there during
                        this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: At the time I don't recall anything happening there. The question about
                    Pakistan and IndiPakistan primarilwhich always came up was one of the issues we
                    left to our experts, the nuclear capability issue. I think there were three
                    pieces of legislation on the nuclear capability of Pakistan and presidential
                    certification of continued assistance. Also, the Afghan war was winding down so
                    that was a major factor. We had so many offices in the State Department and
                    outside of it involved in the Afghan war that it was oftentimes difficult to get
                    every clearance you might want. The other thing that did occuand I'm trying to
                    think exactly when it did, but I was in charge that dawas the crashing of the
                    Zia ul-Haq's aircraft with our ambassador Arnold Raphel on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I was on a task force and also was available for overnighting on that
                    one. I think we were tentative on the reason for the crash. Ultimately, I seem
                    to recall, it was proven that it was not sabotage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. It was not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I don't remember personally. The thing about incidents like this is that
                    you never have a conclusion. The best investigations go on and on and you never
                    know with precision how they turn out. Obviously there was an extreme amount of
                    regret over the incident, and great sadness over Raphel. And there was the SAO,
                    the security assistance officer, who was also on the plane, I seem to
                    recall.</p>
                <p>The core of our guidance was to emphasize the stability and continuation of our
                    policy and strong relationship with Pakistan. There were variations, but that
                    was the general thrust.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find a difference in dealing say with the
                        relationship of the India-Pakistan side of NEA, which has now been split
                        off, and the other part of it? Because I've heard that there's been problems
                        with dealing with Iran-Iraq because so much of NEA has concentrated on the
                        Israeli situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's wrong, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so when you get to Iran and Iraq and the Gulf, that's
                        kind of out there; and then you move over to India-Pakistan. Did you find in
                        getting clearances that the Indian-Pakistani people were saying, “Hey, pay
                        some attention to us?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No, on a daily basis Afghanistan, primarily, was an issue that always
                    came up and it had very high visibility. Then the Pakistan issue was a constant
                    one. One of the things you've got to look at is how we are driven. How does the
                    press spokesman get these questions that he gives us everyday? Well, obviously
                    if something major happened, he's going to want to know about it. But the way he
                    usually does it is he has a corps of press officers who've come in earlier in
                    the morning and gone through every newspaper. From those newspapers and wire
                    services they have come up with a host of tentative questions. Then the press
                    spokesman looks at what they have produced, eliminates some, adds some, and then
                    they're given to us. He basically is giving us questions based on what is
                    happening in the world. If there is nothing that the media is concentrating on
                    happening in India, we're not going to write guidances about India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're not going to stir things up. (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No. Of course if a major event occurs like the gassing of the Kurds, is
                    it our job to write press guidance? Or do we wait? Not at all. We have press
                    guidance immediately written down. If something happens in a place in our
                    region, it is part of our job is to find out what the issues are and to make
                    sure that the State Department, up to the press spokesman and in the bureau, is
                    aware of this before they're called and surprised by someone from the New York
                    Times. We found at the time that when you took the Department press spokesman's
                    hour-long briefing you could break it down by questions from the news media or
                    by the amount of time that the spokesman would devote to topic “A” or “B,” and
                    oftentimes well over half the spokesman's time was devoted to Middle East
                    issueour issues.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The first issue of that nature that my family and I confronted was
                    Riyadh. We had always nursed the vision of it being such a primitive outpost in
                    the middle of the desert, with far more “Wahhabi,” or more puritanical
                    sensitivities, and not a very fun placeven somewhat primitive. It was surprising
                    to see the amount of progress that had occurred in Riyadh in the eight years
                    that I had been away from the kingdom, especially in the diplomatic quarter (DQ)
                    where we would be living. The DQ is an area adjacent to Riyadh just on the
                    outskirts and had been beautifully planned and landscaped. The new embassy
                    building and embassy housing were there.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>The city itself had been well-funded by the Saudis and had been made into a
                    rather dramatic towI wouldn't say beautiful, but not unattractivwith a very good
                    infrastructure of roads and communications. The desert air was, as always, an
                    extremely different experience from the humid, languid atmosphere that always
                    was in Jeddah. Quite refreshing, and the winters were extremely mild, but again
                    they did not have the languishing atmosphere on the coasthe Red Sea or the
                    Persian Gulf. So it had some attractions. It was still, and it remains as far as
                    I can tell, sort of the capitol of puritanical Islam that dominates Saudi
                    politics and religion, and your liberties were somewhat restrained by that.
                    Being a diplomat did make that bearable. Living in the quarter, which you might
                    think was being sequestered, was in fact more liberating in the sense that there
                    was more of a toleratioless of a feeling of being observed and being?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could have a swimming pool and that sort of
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: You could. And the religious police, from time to time, would frequent
                    the diplomatic quarter, but it was not often. Incidents were rare there, and
                    involved cases where religious police would encounter people and warn them or
                    apprehend them for violating rules on modesty, conduct or dress. Women were just
                    a bit freer there. I don't think you would find women riding bicycles outside of
                    the DQ; you would find them there. The social events were just a bit freer there
                    and it was quite beautiful. The embassy itself was an extremely attractive
                    place, inside and out. And again, the housing, although there were many
                    complaints of it being too small, seemed quite functional and especially because
                    it was new it was very workable and had minimal problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your ambassador? You must've probably had a
                        couple, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No I didn't, actually. Chas Freeman had gotten there just before I did
                    and he left three years later after the war with Iraq, and the charg�
                    afterwards, David Welch, those were the COMs (Chiefs of Mission) during the time
                    I was in Riyadh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First let's look at the Saudi form of government. I mean
                        it had eight years or so to absorb more money and all. Did you see a
                        difference in the Saudi government and society? I'm talking about at the
                        time you arrived.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I can't think of any great change. When I left Jeddah in '83 Fahd was
                    king, and when I got to Riyadh he was still king and operating as king. I don't
                    think his position had been consolidated that much. More or less it seems the
                    system just kept moving. There were no big changes, as I recall, in the system
                    that I noticed when I first got there.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>While I was in Riyadh there was an economic downturn and the Saudis were
                    beginning to cut back on subsidies. You began to have questions about real
                    poverty among Saudis in Riyadh in certain areas. It was a hard question to
                    answer. Certainly they were no longer getting what they had been getting ten
                    years earlier. Still, it was obvious that the dole for the royal family and
                    those in the elites hadn't stopped. In fact, it might've expanded. This would in
                    turn cause, along with the introduction of western influences by the American
                    troopthese two factors would begin to call into question the family's authority,
                    the family's adherence to religious tenets in the kingdom. A number of factors
                    would contribute to that questioning. This was political work and I wasn't doing
                    political work but you began to get in the street tapes, some pamphlets, some
                    sermons at mosques that were not exactly in accord with the established party
                    line. People were talking more about a renaissance, talking more of the good
                    'ole times, their paradisiacal version of the values that the Prophet had
                    brought to the peninsula in the 7th-century. That was a veiled reference to the
                    lack of corruption in those earlier days, and that became more worrisome to the
                    authorities. In some cases certain preachers who were giving these types of
                    sermons were observed or perhaps taken away for a period of time. Again, it was
                    not an area that I focused on, but it was a time of questioning, one in which
                    you saw more of a general rumbling.</p>
                <p>There have always been, from time to time, calls by commercial types for greater
                    participation; very, very subtle calls for the kingdom to begin to accommodate
                    itself to getting more participation of groups in the society. This was a call
                    that began when FahI think it was in '79 or '8began to talk about the creation
                    of Majlis al-Shura, which was the consultative council made up of key elements
                    in society. This tapped into an interest of certain circles, but not knowing
                    what it really meant because Fahd never would explain it to any great degree.
                    Those currents had gone up and down while I had been away and you could still
                    hear them from time to time when I was there. I believe ultimately the body was
                    created, but that was after I left. What it does and how suitable it is is a
                    question that I can't answer. It happened after I was gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the political-military officer. Where did that
                        position fit within the embassy? You had the ambassador, Chas Freeman, his
                        deputy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: David Dunford at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: David Dunford.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: He went on to be ambassador in Oman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then the political counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>PIERCE: No. In Riyadh, given the import of our military relationship, we had our
                    own political-military section which was headed by a counselor who was a member
                    of the Country Team. There were a number of reasons for that, primarily simply
                    because of the amount of foreign military sales and the programs that we had
                    with the kingdoalso because of the significant coordination that the embassy
                    felt important with the American military regarding how they viewed Saudi Arabia
                    and how they wanted to try to heighten political-military cooperation. We were a
                    section in and of ourselves. There were three officers and a secretary, as well
                    as the head. In Saudi Arabia we had a very complicated system of SAO, security
                    assistance offices. At the time two officers of general rank, one who was a
                    two-star officer in charge of something called USMTM, the military training
                    mission. Traditionally this was an Air Force position. There were several
                    hundred U.S. military involved in advising and contributing to U.S. military
                    programs for the Saudi military. There was also a one-star general who was Army
                    and he was in charge of something called the OPM-SANG, which was a separate
                    advisory group working for the Saudi National Guard to help modernize that
                    institution. The USMTM had a relationship with the Ministry of Defense. The
                    Minister of Defense was Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz, the brother of the king.
                    The Saudi National Guard was under the supervision and leadership of Crown
                    Prince Abdullah and was a totally separate entity. The OPM-SANG had a
                    relationship solely with the Saudi National Guard.</p>
                <p>There was another small group there which was the Corps of Engineers which ten
                    years earlier had been involved in massive construction and modernization,
                    building infrastructure for the Saudi military for the Ministry of Defense
                    airbases primarily. That program, as these facilities had been completed, was
                    pared down and during the time I was there it was a very small group that still
                    had an ordnance supportive role with some aspects of the Saudi military under
                    the Ministry of Defense. So there were three groups primarily involved in
                    security assistance programs, and one of the primary roles that my section had
                    was to interact, to coordinate, to keep updated on the programs of our military
                    assistance with the kingdom. The job required intensive building of
                    relationships and maintaining them with the individual U.S. military groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there in '89 what were you getting from your
                        own personal observation, the other officers in the political-military
                        section, and from your American military counterparts? What was the sense of
                        the Saudi military establishment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: By “sense” what do you mean?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Effectiveness. Your eyebrows went up. (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>PIERCE: (laughs) No they didn't. You just think you saw that. The Saudi military,
                    depending on the units, would have varying degrees of effectiveness. One of the
                    primary goals of our military groups there was to enhance that ability and to
                    try to make them as capable as possible through a modernization program. In some
                    areas they were extremely good. As I recalthis is anecdotal; I have no way of
                    knowing thithe Saudi pilots, for example, were very good at flying and in
                    combat. In fact during the war with Iraq they flew the second largest number of
                    sorties of any of the nationwe being firsagainst Iraq. But you had significant
                    shortcomings. I think the farther away from the Air Force you got, for example,
                    there were a lot of questions on the Saudi army sidin terms of systems that
                    would have to be adopted as they were moving into modernization. At the time we
                    were in the middle of beginning a program for their purchase of Abrams heavy
                    tanks, and this was an area where they were going to have a lot of work to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again dates become important. In '89 how were those
                        involved with looking at Saudi national defense looking at the threat, the
                        situation around them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I'm sorry. You mean “those” who? Those Americans or?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Americans and others. There may have been divergent views,
                        but what was the feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I think one of the issues that you could see affecting the kingdom was a
                    tendency often in the comprehensive U.S. policy to lump the Middle East together
                    and to view the Arab-Israeli issue as the primary one that colored all. This was
                    a major problem in the sense of trying to modernize the Saudi defense
                    requirements. The result was a very, very tortured, very, very slow proceeding
                    on the part of administrations in proposing arms sales and giving congressional
                    notification, sometimes significantly resulting in failure. The Arab-Israeli
                    issue always seemed to become interjected into Saudi Arabia's defense
                    requirements.</p>
                <p>If you looked at the kingdom, on the other hand, you could see surrounding it
                    were a host of countries that were well constituted threats, or were unstable.
                    You could look at the time at South Yemen, which constituted a threat of some
                    sort, and because hostilities had broken out along the border there. North
                    Yemen, at the time, was unstable and had that potential. Iraq at the time was
                    blatantly a threat and proved absolutely to be one. Iran, especially after the
                    Iranian revolution, there were very purposeful attacks on the kingdom's
                    legitimacy and stability coming out of Tehran. Across the Red Sea you had an
                    unsettled Sudan. And while Egypt was stable, I think the Saudis could view Egypt
                    from the point of history as a place from which invaders came, although the
                    relationships were always quite good with Egypt during the modern era. It was
                    over a longer view of historwhich the Saudis always toothough I'm not trying to
                    say that Egypt was a threat. In essence Saudi Arabia had a history of borders
                    that were unsettled, and then you had some very direcnot overt, but very
                    stronthreats coming mainly from the Gulf on the Iran side.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>And so you had legitimate defense requirements, and the question was how much do
                    we want to help the Saudis gain capabilities to be a deterrent or to contain the
                    minor incidents that might occur along their borderperhaps in the south or on
                    the eastern side. Also, greater security assistance programs would make
                    potentially greater military cooperation, if and when the time arose that we
                    might need to become more active militarily in the region. If you have no
                    security assistance programs and suddenly a threat emerges that is extreme and
                    pressing, the ability to suddenly have military cooperation is severely
                    constrained, because you simply do not have, on the ground, an awareness of
                    their capability, an interaction with them, or the personal ties that you simply
                    have to have in order to get cooperation, in order to get exchange, in order to
                    immediately get the benefits of an alliance or a partnership. That was what was
                    needed in 1990 when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, when you arrived, was the embassy, our military,
                        and also on the Saudi defense side, looking at Iraq or looking at Iran?
                        Which one were they looking at?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's a very difficult question. For the Arab world, Iran at the time
                    was always the most visible threat. The Iran-Iraq War had wound down and Iran
                    had suffered a major military defeat, yet their stridency, their belligerency
                    and their reported desire to stir up religious minorities, Shias, in the eastern
                    province, which is a long-term situatioalso Shia in Bahraiwas always a fear that
                    the Saudis had. So that was the first threat that they would always mention.
                    When you got to talking about Iraq, the public position was that there was no
                    threat there. It was very difficult for them to make the case in the public
                    domain, but you could always tell that there was one and in private they would
                    allude to the Iraqi threat. This was the main threat, but you would never say
                    it, simply because of this concept of Arab unity, this concept of “my brother
                    Arab” which is honored publicly, though often not in private circles or amongst
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what about at the embassy with Chas Freeman as the
                        ambassador? Would there be any sort of look at the situation from time to
                        time, particularly by those involved in the military efforts as you were,
                        where you would sit around and say, “Well, what happens here,” or “We could
                        do this?” I mean were we writing out contingency papers or brainstorming or
                        anything of that nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>PIERCE: One of the primary jobs of the political-military section is always to
                    promote or to react to ambassadorial front office queries along those lines.
                    This is a constant. Saudi Arabia was one of the few places in which to me at the
                    time a political-military section was justifiein the sense of really needing to
                    think very carefully through our approaches, how we could foster and advance
                    military cooperation, how we had to take into consideration Saudi sensitivities
                    in trying to promote closer cooperation. This was a very, very important factor.
                    It was very difficult and you can see it today as it has spun oufor the Saudis
                    to accept the presence of foreign soldiers on Saudi territory after the invasion
                    of Kuwait. And it did produce a public reaction.</p>
                <p>It was very difficult for the Saudis to reconcile what they considered our biased
                    approach to the Middle East peace process, and their closer cooperation with us,
                    and doing it in a way that appeared overt. It opened them up to accusations by,
                    primarily, Iran, but also by Libya from time to time. There was sometimes
                    sniping from other Arab governments accusing them of hypocrisy or taking
                    positions that were not supportive of Palestine or the Arab goals in Jerusalem.
                    Those were very touchy issues that still have to play themselves out. At the
                    time it was a very difficult question. They wanted the cooperation but the
                    difficulty was how open it could be without leaving them susceptible to attacks
                    by Iran and others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way you in your position were having to look at both
                        sides. If we did too much for the Saudis we'd get hit by the pro-Israeli
                        forces in the United States. And the Saudis on the other hand had a worry
                        about both internally and externally getting too close with the United
                        States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, coming back to the embassy and this time, you had
                        Central Command down there. Were you asking where is the threat coming from
                        or what do we do about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: We were mainly defining the threat. Obviously we had a very active
                    Defense Attach� Office (DAO) in Riyadh, as well as the USMTM security advisors.
                    Their primary job wasn't to analyze threats, but at the same time it was.
                    Primarily because if you advance military programs, or try to get the U.S.
                    government into new military programs, you have to define the threat. Threat
                    analysis on the part of all of us was a continuing process; trying to analyze it
                    and also trying to devisand especially with the militaries (our military with
                    theirs) trying to come up with programs that in the long-term would be suitable
                    to redress or to counter individual threats from the military or political side.
                    This was a constant issue that you always deal with.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>The Defense Attach�s' Office would submit reports through their channels; the
                    USMTM mainly in concert with us, because we both had to work carefully when we
                    were into proposed arm sales. We would analyze the threats; they would have the
                    most direct link with CENTCOM. Then, of course, we had our exchange programs
                    with the Saudis. We had a very close relationship with them in terms of threat
                    analysis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about you and your office? Were you getting pretty
                        good reports about what was happening in Iran and Iraq, particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: One of the things that Ambassador Freeman did was to encourage, and would
                    organize, weekly political-military meetings in which all of the major military
                    players as well as those players on the rest of the Country Team who were
                    involved in the military and issues of general stability would get together and
                    exchange views. This was at a supervisory level. At the working level one of the
                    things you've got to do in the Political-Military Section is to assure that you
                    are up to speed on virtually anything that has an impact on the threat against
                    the kingdom. And we had access to anything everyone else had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Was there some reservation in the beginning? I mean
                        here you were an Arabist and a lot of others were Arabists there and all of
                        a sudden you get a Chinese language officer as ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No. We had no thoughts along that line. I was impressed by the way
                    Freeman would take issues and basically refocus them. It was very interesting to
                    see. He had vision, which again, in terms of the military side was to have
                    stronger political military cooperation, but to do it in a way that wouldn't
                    severely strain the Saudi-American relationship. And ultimately we were thinking
                    that once you begin to have a relationship you can expand it as they get more
                    comfortable with it.</p>
                <p>One of the things we had always done is have a very good relationship with their
                    navy. It's easy to have a relationship with the navy, because the navy doesn't
                    operate on Saudi territory. They were very interested in having exchanges with
                    us in various operations. The problem with the navy is that it was not a
                    significant branch in the Saudi military. We had the same type of approach with
                    the air force, but it was a little bit more standoffish because their air force
                    requirements or interests, they wanted aircraft sometimes from us that it was
                    difficult to be responsive to. These were the F-15 issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>The army, on the other hand, was where you needed the strongest type of military
                    cooperation, because that would be the force that would be the main threat
                    repellant. It was more difficult simply because the army is on Saudi territory
                    and you've got to figure out ways in which you can slowly build up a
                    relationship and a trust that might move into further military cooperation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Prince Sultan? What you were
                        getting both you and your colleagues. Again your eyebrows have gone up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No they weren't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I had the opportunity to be in many meetings with Prince Sultan and
                    looked at him for a very long time. He's a very, very interesting fellow. Now
                    this is a difficult question to answer. I think overall he saw that the kingdom
                    could have greater security through a relationship with the U.S. And he saw it
                    manifested, not surprisingly, in more and more arms sales. He was very effective
                    in articulating that. He was also very effective in making the rounds. Many of
                    the Saudi military installations are in the middle of nowherway ouand he would,
                    once or twice a year, make the rounds to all of these places and to basically
                    warm up the esprit. He did that very well.</p>
                <p>The problem he had was that he had been minister of defense since 1970 or
                    something. He had seen come and go six or seven secretaries of defense, and over
                    that period of time had heard our promises, our statements of policy, our views
                    toward the Gulf, our views toward the Arab-Israeli procesviews he would always
                    ask about. He would hear one from one and a totally different version from
                    another, and it would go up and down, and up and down. Our policy would not be a
                    straight, solid, unwavering, direct policy. It would wax and wane. And I know
                    he'd notice this because in every meeting he had a scribe who would write down
                    exactly everything everyone said, so he had access to everything any secretary
                    of defense ever told him. So I'm not so sure he had any great faith in our
                    constancy. And that made him standoffish to a degree, I think, which is
                    understandable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: He was more skeptical, but I don't mean to say very skeptical, because
                    there's no alternative for the Saudis and they've had a good relationship with
                    us. He was less accepting than King Fahd, for example, who probably didn't have
                    his experience of the history of ups and downs in this specific aspect of our
                    policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well of course our people all came in full of enthusiasm
                        or whatever you want to say about what the latest policy was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: There's nuance change; there always is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I would think the Yemen threat was basically a border
                        guerrilla type war, but with Iran and Iraq you're looking at two large
                        countries. The demographics of that are such that they've got big
                        populations and Saudi Arabia is a small population.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: There you go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that when you're talking about an army, if anything
                        goes overland?I mean air force, yes, a small, elite air force can take care
                        of a large, not-so-elite air force, but when you're talking about land stuff
                        there must've been implicit in some of the planning that sometime we're
                        going to have to put troops down here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: This goes into a CENTCOM planning issue which we had to deal with
                    ultimately, and it's always in the back of your mind. That would really depend
                    on what the threat was. I'm talking pre-invasion. But that would depend on what
                    the threat was and how you would respond, and how good your rapport was with
                    Saudi leaders, which was the key factor that did help us when it finally
                    happened. How good your cooperation was on the ground. I made the argument for
                    more sophisticated fire power. There are not a lot of Saudi military; therefore
                    they need weapons systems that have more lethality and operate in greater
                    concentration. This was an argument we'd frequently use as we would provide arm
                    sales proposals to SECSTATE (Secretary of State) for coordination and ultimately
                    White House approval, and if and when they would be notified in Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we getting anywhere with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: It was a fight, but I think the Abrams tanks happened just as I got
                    there. In other words the work had already been done. One of the long-smoldering
                    issues was F-15 E's?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain this for somebody who doesn't know what
                        we're talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The Saudis had already purchased a number of F-15 series aircraft.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was really our mainline fighter, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: It was at the time, yes. I guess it still is. I've forgotten most of my
                    POL/MIL (Political/Military Section) stuff, but in essence these were primarily
                    designed for air defense and air fighting. Among many strengths the F-15 version
                    had a ground attack capability. For several years the Saudis had made repeated
                    requests for them, and these had been basically postponed because of its ground
                    attack capability. When you would make a proposal of that nature, it would
                    trigger alarm bells amongst some members of Congress as to its potential for use
                    in a war with Israel in the future. That argument would ignore the fact that the
                    Saudis did need to have a ground attack capability by their aircraft because of
                    the threats that they were facing, just using common sense from Iran or
                    Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Now you said earlier that and objectively speaking you're righthat Yemen
                    would be minor border irritations, but I think the Saudis always nursed a
                    greater fear simply because that Yemen border area was the focus of a conflict
                    in the '30s, and it still is in the back of their minds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say so much depended on relations with the Saudis. At
                        your level, how did you work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Relations in the sense of you're talking primarily military to military
                    contacts here. Not relations through the embassy. One of the hardest things was
                    for embassy personnel to have direct contact with Saudi military. Entering the
                    Ministry of Defense required permission; you had to get permission to enter and
                    to go see someone. It was very difficult. When you tried to do that the answer
                    would come back, “We deal with USMTM; we don't deal with embassy people,” or,
                    “We will see you, but with a USMTM person available.” It was very difficult to
                    do. We were able to get some contacts, but not very many. And they were not very
                    productive, in a direct sense, with Saudi military in their settings. More
                    successful was seeing heads of certain groups with a security assistance
                    adviser's presence; such as the upper tiers of the National Guard through our
                    brigadier general there. Also going out with the ambassador to pay calls on
                    people like Prince Khalid bin Sultan who was the son of a minister and at the
                    time was the head of the Saudi Air Defense Force, which ultimately moved into
                    the Patriot issue. As you might recall, during the war with Iraq he became the
                    overall commander-in-chief of the Saudi forces.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>The other way you made contacts, was through American Defense contractors. There
                    were a host of them there, mainly involved in direct programs with the Saudis,
                    but also trying to get the Saudis to want certain systemand then trying to get
                    the U.S. government to support the Saudi desire. Also with Saudi military
                    contractors. This would be a good way to get impressions, to find out what Saudi
                    thinking was in a more informal way. You could find out more or less what was
                    going on below the surface. When you did that, for example, you found that the
                    Saudi Ministry of the Interior had an intense interest in upgraded
                    communications systems, mainly security warning systems and other infrastructure
                    around the borders.</p>
                <p>You also ended up running in the great game of competition with defense firms
                    from other nationalitiemainly French and Britiswhich was an interesting side
                    show to the political military situation in the kingdom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you given the brief to make sure to do whatever you
                        could to push American products? Were you pretty well constrained by your
                        lack of direct contact with the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's an interesting question and it's basically one that you had to
                    approach on an ad hoc basis. There are certain areas which just simply are not
                    doable from the standpoint of what Saudis may want and what the U.S. is going to
                    allow. It's a sensitivity issue. If you had a question about certain systems,
                    you could always find someone at USMTM and say, “Well, what about this [or
                    that]?” One of them was a system where that aircraft could identify friend or
                    foe (IFF). It was a very sensitive issue, one very difficult for us to touch in
                    concrete ways. Whether there was a competitor in that I don't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might say for the person who is reading this, IFF has
                        been done for a long time. How do you tell that things are moving very
                        rapidly and is it a friend or a foe? Usually it's an electronic
                        response.</hi>

                <p>PIERCE: But mainly between aircraft.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it can also be with tanks and aircraft and all of
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>PIERCE: This was mainly an aircraft issue. That issue was very difficult. I mean
                    there were some systems that were usable, but the more advanced ones raised
                    touchy issues. Sometimes there were areas in which the French were going to win.
                    They were just going to win. And the British were going to win. One area where
                    we were trying was the navy. The navy was predominantly using French material. I
                    think the British were coming in second; maybe we were. But we were saying, when
                    you look ahead to the time you will need to replace your naval ships, you should
                    look at American sources. It was a difficult issue, but we tried, though there
                    didn't seem to be much potential. But this was ten years ago.</p>
                <p>The British challenge was most dramatically seen in the Al-Yamamah barter deal
                    with weapons in exchange for oil. The British provided Tornado aircraft and a
                    host of other aircraft, and built a large airbase in the kingdom. This was under
                    Prince Sultan and that was going to happewhether you would question its ethics,
                    whether it's efficient. There were a host of questions that came up about it,
                    but this was going to happen in the kingdom. The kingdom was very interested in
                    this type of exchange, one that was quite difficult for us to do just by the
                    mechanism of how our sales occur. Still, in terms of actual programs we did have
                    the most significant relationship with the kingdom, which was as it should've
                    been and how it should be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the National Guard. I think I raised the
                        subject before, but back in my timwe're talking about the 1950the National
                        Guard, or I guess it was then called the White Army, was kept as sort of a
                        counterpoint to the regular army, being seen as a little more loyal to the
                        king or something. It was a time when all of the other Arab countries were
                        being taken over by their military and all. Was this still sort of in the
                        backs of people's minds?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I don't think so. When the National Guard was first formed shortly
                    thereafter, maybe as late as '62, when King Faisal came in officially and Saud
                    was deposed as king, most of the current leaders came in. Prince Sultan, King
                    Fahd, Crown Prince Abdullah. This type of desert politics that you're
                    suggestindesert political military stufhas always remained in the backs of the
                    minds of the Saudis, but it has been proven it's not really the role of the
                    National Guard today. They performed admirably in the invasion; they were
                    extremely good. And they had modernized. We started a relationship with them,
                    maybe in '74, and had an agreement supporting the crown prince's desire to see
                    it modernized, while at the same time be recognized as more of a relic of the
                    past.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had been considered almost a tribal levy or something
                        like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes it was. A bunch of guys with guns who sit up there in the mountains
                    and repel any of the invaders; good medieval stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: But he wanted to see it modernized and become a secondary backup force
                    with some internal security responsibilities and also border responsibilities.
                    That's what spawned this very productive relationship that our army has had with
                    the National Guard. And it also solidifiecontrary to what many pundits
                    suggesAbdullah's strong appreciation of, and tie to, the United States. He had
                    always been thought of as being just a bit more standoffish, and not as close to
                    the United States as perhaps Fahd. While he has a different attitude and a
                    different approacI sat in several meetings with him and followed his thinking
                    quite closelI never detected that at all. I think you get into the same sort of
                    reservations that Prince Sultan had, where he might question our constancy and
                    perhaps even the wisdom of our approach to the Arab-Israeli question, which is a
                    dominant one for any Arab.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: But in the sense of our partnership with the kingdom and its utility for
                    both, I think that's unwavering and it's far more dramatically expressed by him
                    than perhaps by any other prominent Saudi that I've encountered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Gulf states a factor at aleither a support or a
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: There was always an interest that we had, since the early '80s when the
                    GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) was formed, as to whether it could take on a
                    military component; in other words have a united GCC force. There was some
                    attention given to that. Yet I think the governments of those countries werand
                    again, I don't know what the relationship is nothe GCC evolved politically. It
                    evolved economically in certain ways and in certain other forms of day to day
                    cooperation. The military aspect of it was slower to evolve. The issue begins to
                    boil around how much of your military capability do you want to cede to GCC, and
                    can the GCC be seen as taking part of yours away or making you stronger. That's
                    a difficult question and it never was fully answered. You still had the
                    beginnings of adopting political positions that had effects on their military
                    approaches, but ultimately each country was going to set its own military
                    priorities. The GCC was not going to produce a military position at variance
                    with them. So it was an evolving situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, talking about evolving situations, can we talk about
                        your personal experience of events that led up to the Gulf War, were we
                        seeing clouds, or when did the adrenaline start to flow?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>PIERCE: That's a question that you can find in books better than you can from me.
                    When you're working an issue on a day to day basis, the issue was the tension
                    between Kuwait and Iraq. You'd read the traffic; you'd read the cables coming
                    out of Iraq, coming out of Kuwait. You could see a lot of parrying,
                    manipulating, backing-and-forthinalso from the UAE at the time. And you always
                    get into this question of well, we've done this. We've been here before. Is this
                    the time or isn't it the time? It boils down to are you taking every crisis like
                    this seriouslI mean to the extremor are you just trying to work it to pull back
                    the brinkmanship? I think it was an issue that was in the back of my mind but it
                    wasn't the primary one on which we were focused.</p>
                <p>I do remember the night before August 1, I went oumy family was not in the
                    country at the timwith a friend of mine and the next morning I woke up at about
                    7:30, turned on the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation), and I heard the news
                    and I said, “This is going to be a very bad day.” (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs) Well Chas Freeman I think was up in Newport,
                        Rhode Island, or someplace like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: He was not in the kingdom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. There were a lot of people that were saying this was
                        not going to be a good day. (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: (laughs) And it wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So just to give a person who doesn't understand this an
                        idea, what did you do that day?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Okay, we did a couple of things. Firstly, you get into the embassy and
                    you try to get some sense of what's going on. You don't get an awful lot; you
                    get more from the radio than you do from our traffic, simply because the issue
                    is so inchoate and so unknown. You begin to call around and try to find out from
                    your military contacts where their people are. Because some of the security
                    assistance officers were in Kuwait at the time. Then you call a number of bases
                    closer to the Kuwait border and see where we have military programmers who are
                    visiting and see if you could find out what's going on from them. You check very
                    carefully and make sure of what you're doing with both of your consulates. By
                    noon you're beginning to have a very, very vague picture as to what's going on,
                    and begin sending in some cablevery, very sparse cableabout the situation.</p>
                <p>I don't recall an awful lot of information that we had. The situation was just
                    very vague and very unknown. It stayed that way for a few days; the joy being
                    that Saddam Hussein decided to stop on the Kuwaiti border. By then things had
                    developed to the degree that Secretary Cheney was en route to the kingdom.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling when you started hearing this to
                        say, “Oh my God, they may come all the way.” Were you talking particularly
                        about Saddam Hussein as being really a loose cannon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Oh certainly. I just remembered this. On Sunday, my family was coming
                    back into the kingdom and arriving at the Riyadh airport Sunday morning. I
                    remember going out to the Riyadh airport and there was this great big window
                    there looking out to the east and I just kept looking up there wondering, “Are
                    the planes coming over?” (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: It was nothing, of course, but you've got a lot of apprehension. You
                    began to ask for information like if you came to the Kuwait border with Saudi
                    Arabia and decided to barrel down to Riyadh, how many hours would it take to get
                    here? You want to know what Saudi units might be in real force between here and
                    the border. You also ask the same question about Dhahran. You begin to think
                    about where the desal plants are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Desalinization plants.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Desalinization, which is ninety percent of the water in Riyadh, for
                    example. You have an awful lot of questions, which thank God I didn't have to
                    worry that much about, but questions from the American community. Another
                    ramification was that the American community primarily was there for contracts.
                    The expertise in the desal plants. Significant expertise in the oil
                    infrastructure. Expertise in defense programs. They were quite predominant and
                    you were very interested in keeping in touch with them. I kept in touch with the
                    ones involved in the military programs, but the embassy did it at large. Great
                    consternation and a great sense of, not anxietI wouldn't say that, but just an
                    unknown feeling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Secretary of Defense Cheney came and had a very important
                        meeting with King Fahd.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What task was laid upon you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Our ambassador came with Cheney for that meeting, and, in essence, at
                    that time our main focuwhich is normally what you dwas to provide the
                    infrastructure to coordinate with the Saudi sidknowing what Mr. Cheney wanted to
                    do, who he wanted to meet with, when he wanted to do it, and who else would be
                    with him. It was primarily who he wanted to see, and that was the king.
                    Basically it's a coordination issue where you are trying to set up the
                    infrastructure and work with the Saudis so that this group will have a place for
                    accommodation and sufficient transportation, and have a schedule laid out that
                    will identify when and where he might see the king. You would also providwhich
                    is always what you do, even in a situation like thisome background as to where
                    we think the Saudis are coming from. Which in this sense was kind of vague
                    simply because the situation was so murky. Prince Sultan was noI forget where he
                    was; he might've been out of the country at the timso he was not a factor. He
                    did arrive during the visit, but after the meeting with the king as I recall,
                    and had a separate meeting with Cheney. I could be mistaken about that. So
                    that's what you do. We had about 36 hours notice to do all that.</p>
                <p>That is being helped on the other side, as I recalbut this might be just logic
                    and not actualitby the Saudi embassy here in Washington through Prince Bandar
                    who facilitates all that. But the actual working out the schedule, getting it
                    all together and making it happen, rests with the embassy and with USMTM. Mainly
                    when you're going into political issues, which meeting with the king perforce
                    not a military one, the embassy takes the lead and the military people on the
                    ground are in support of you. Now obviously when Cheney came he had an intensive
                    relationship with our military on the ground in Saudi Arabia, but when he
                    interacts with the political leaders, the embassy normally is the one that
                    orchestrates that event. And that's what we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the meeting were the Saudis, “Alright, this is the
                        big time now.” Was this pretty apparent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes. It's not like immediately you go up and here are the F-15s, but
                    within say 24 hours or so they began to arrive. What you'd had initially was the
                    SAOs on the ground. The SAOs are security advisers, they're not military
                    combatants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: SAO being?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Security Assistance Officers. They're not their advisers. They're not
                    here to fight a war. So then you began to move in the actual CENTCOM deployed
                    troops from the various units in the States or from elsewhere, and you began to
                    get ranking officers setting up CENTCOM forward headquarters. This is when the
                    embassy begins to coordinate very carefully with the CENTCOM elements. Freeman
                    was very good at this. He recognized immediately that this is a military
                    operation; they are independent of the chief of mission. But his intent, which
                    one of my main charges and he very carefully did it as well, was to get a
                    cooperative bond with the CENTCOM headquarters, with CENTCOM, and to keep that
                    in a constantly updated, coordinated way, so that we and they would always have
                    a position in respect to what we needed to do in the kingdom that was cohesive.
                    He worked very hard at that and it was one of the jobs that my section was
                    charged with doing. On a day to day basis this is what you did. And we, over the
                    period of time that they were there, developed a tremendously close, coordinated
                    role mainly with their J-5, their planners. But also with their J-4?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “J-4” being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Supply. Those were the main two, but we would have coordination on other
                    matters. They would want to write manuals, for example. This was very day to day
                    stuff. Manuals or little pamphlets for introducing troops on how to survive in
                    the kingdom in public places. We would basically give our very heavy guidances
                    as to what was right. They would want to know how to interact. We would be in
                    close contact with them. They had a daily staff meeting and somebody from my
                    office was always there at CENTCOM headquarters. The ambassador quickly invited
                    them into our coordinated POL/MIL meeting that I mentioned to you. Then the
                    ambassador and Schwarzkopf, when he got there, began having a close relationship
                    of sharing, and we were able to get our DCM to have the same type of meeting
                    with his chief of staff. As you know, the DCM is sort of an executive officer;
                    the chief of staff is sort of an executive officer. At both of these meetings
                    they had things to talk about, but we would always make sure their agendas were
                    filled with issues that we felt were worth bringing up. This was a relationship
                    that persisted throughout their presence. Almost as soon as the first group came
                    iit might've been a full-bird colonel in charge of it thewe were down there
                    meeting. After that General Horner came in when we were there. When Schwarzkopf
                    came the situation solidified. And then with their J-5 and then their POLAD.
                    Their POLAD (State Department political adviser to CENTCOM) was their major
                    information conveyor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Gordon Brown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Gordon Brown, whom I have interviewed.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>I think it's interesting to look at this closely, because here was an operation
                    which was both successful and started off right from the ground being
                    cooperative. Because normally we, the embassy type people, say, “Well, you can't
                    do this and that,” and the military says, “Get out of my way; we're going to do
                    it our way.” Would you say lessons had been learned on both sides or was it the
                    people who were directing it? What caused this close, effective
                    relationship?</p>
                <p>PIERCE: I can't speak from the military's side, but I would say that Freeman made
                    it clear that this is what we were going to do, and it did not take my section
                    any great period of time to figure that out. And that's when we began to move.
                    But he began straight off the bat making the overtures, making sure that the
                    CINC was aware of what our attitude was, and then we solidified it on a day to
                    day basis.</p>
                <p>Now another thing that goes back to that point is when General Horner flew
                    in?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Horner being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The head of the Air Force. When he flew in to that airbase in Riyadh,
                    Horner already knew the Saudi general who went out to meet him. They had a long
                    fruitful relationship. Horner and the people he flew in with already knew what
                    that base was because we had had programs in position there. This was the result
                    of the military cooperation, the military programs. We already knew what their
                    capabilities were in terms of their aircraft, what they could do with them and
                    what those aircraft could do. We knew we could work with them. This was true in
                    Dhahran when we came in; this was true in Riyadh when we came in. We knew where
                    the administrative defense offices were; we knew the people in there. All of our
                    U.S. military officers had had relationships. That was one of the most
                    significant reasons why we were able to forge a working relationship with the
                    Saudi military on the ground almost immediately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously the pace of life moved up, but here you were

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Everybody stayed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This must've put a certain strain on everyone, didn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Some people it did, some people it didn't. There were a number of
                    questions and problems that spread throughout the community in Dhahran and in
                    Riyadh. First was the poison gas fear, and the rush by the Saudi government to
                    provide gas masks to their citizens and by several embassies to do so as weland
                    our slowness in doing that. Then, ultimately, there was the Scud issue which
                    happened after combat began. Obviously it was an extremely difficult time, with
                    the evacuation that we put into place just before hostilities broke out.</p>
                <p>One of the important thingin a subjective senswas a time when all commercial
                    aircraft into the kingdom stopped. In essence you couldn't get out anymore, and
                    the way people did get out was using U.S. military aircraft to evacuate if they
                    wanted to leave. I felt at that time like there had just been a big lid put over
                    the sky in Riyadh and here we were. And when the whole situation had become
                    resolved, that lid would come off and the stars would come out again.</p>
                <p>I remember after the invasion in Kuwait, and after we introduced our troops
                    there, I always had a sense that ultimately we would move into combat. As events
                    progressed through the later part of '90, inevitably Saddam Hussein, by his
                    ineptness, put himself in a position where he could only be attacked by the
                    allied forces. I remember meeting with Dave Ottaway from the Washington Post,
                    whom I had known from an earlier job, and he said, “Doesn't this seem like a
                    Greek play to you? In essence you have this tragedy out at the enthis terrible
                    thing that's going to happeand all of these players are trying to avoid it, yet
                    they move closer and closer to it and ultimately it's going to happen.” I didn't
                    want to feed him, but I thought that was a very interesting observation, because
                    it's exactly what I felt was happening. And it's what did happen.</p>
                <p>Yes, there was a lot of tension felt by a number of people and it got worse when
                    the Scuds starting falling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. One of the obvious factors was that whereas in the
                        normal course of a war situation coming up, we've got to get all of the
                        American civilians and everything out and move the embassy down and all, in
                        this case we really, for very practical reasons, wanted to keep American
                        civilian personnel and non-embassy people working in oil fields, the
                        desalination plants, on and on and on, because they had to be there in order
                        for the machine to work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was a reversal of almost everything all of us
                        have been trained to do, which is really to get the non-combatants out of
                        the playing field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in any of this outside of making
                        appropriate noises at home or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: We never had any personal reservations about staying. There were
                    voluntary evacuations and a few people in the embassy took advantage of that,
                    but not a lot. When the Scuds started falling, significant numbers of
                    dependentespecially from commercial installationmoved out; and many of the
                    commercial operations as well as commercial military relations, went to skeleton
                    operations. Overnight this happened. I remember I had a friend in a big compound
                    filled with military contractors. The Scuds fell not too far from there and
                    overnight the houses were evacuated. They all got in their cars and scrammewent
                    down to Jeddawhich was a safe place to go. The International School of Riyadh
                    went from, as I recall, a population of 2,000 to 200 within a week. Teachers
                    there were given options to leave and to come back in the future if it should
                    prove that they could. My kids stayed. There were all sorts of rumors about
                    potential terrorist attacks; our kids got instructions on what to do in the
                    event of a bomb near the school. They were very small at the time. It was kind
                    of dramatic but we had never any question about leaving.</p>
                <p>When the Scuds began to fall, my office was in very close contact with the
                    CENTCOM headquarters and would be alerted when there had been a Scud shot out
                    from Iraq. It wouldn't be much. Basically, at any time day or night, we would
                    just know within two minutes that a Scud was going to probably fall somewhere in
                    the Riyadh area. You could confirm it and then sometimes see if the Patriot
                    would hit it, which they would do from time to time, and then check with the
                    CENTCOM headquarters to see, as it developed, what the situation wawhere it hit
                    and whether there might be any ramifications. You would always keep in touch
                    with the ambassador or the DCM about this if it was a significant development.
                    Mostly Scuds were aimed in Riyadh at the Riyadh air base. The problem with the
                    Scuds is that theito use the technical term; I don't know the acronyCIP, the
                    focus range of the Scud was so erratic that it wouldn't hit the Riyadh air base,
                    it would hit something else outside of it. It just wouldn't hit what it was
                    targeted at. Mainly that was an area that was filled with many expatriate
                    defense contractors and they began to get very rattled about the Scud attacks.
                    The Scuds would normally attack abouwould hit, if they were going to hit at
                    althey would hit maybe early evening, late eveninelevenisand early morning. Two
                    of those three times. As the hostilities or combat progressed, they became more
                    erratic, suggesting that they were being coordinated even less professionally
                    than they were initially. They became more random as to where they hit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of hasty firing really.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes. I think the reason being is they were afraid that as soon as a
                    launch was detected they would be zeroed in on by our Air Force. I think that's
                    what happened. But we were living on the fringe of Riyadh in the diplomatic
                    quarter and we were not close to the Riyadh air base, so we did not have the
                    same sense of apprehension that many of the USMTM people who were living near
                    the base, as well as many of the defense contractors. A defense contractor
                    friend said, “We used to have Scud parties.” Yes, they had Scud parties. What
                    they would do is since Scuds only shot at night they would all leavthese guys, a
                    lot of them bachelors now, with all of their families being evacuated, working
                    for the defense companiewould leave and go to the desert and sit around and
                    watch to see if a Scud was coming in and whether a Patriot would come up and hit
                    it. He explained it to me; he was laughing but it was kind of a “funny, ha ha
                    ha, I'm scared to death,” laugh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, let's say up to the buildup before
                        January 17th or 19th, were you pretty well working out of Riyadh or were you
                        going off to Dhahran and other places?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Pretty much out of Riyadh. The most important touch-base for us was the
                    CENCOM headquarters. I would often find myself with the ambassador going down to
                    Jeddah because the kinand I don't remember the precise dateliked to be in Jeddah
                    a lot. This was leading up to the hostilities. I don't remember when he came
                    back to Riyadh. And then Prince Sultan would more often than not be down there.
                    So whenever the ambassador went down to see Prince Sultan, I would go. And that
                    was quite frequently. Over the period of a year Secretary of Defense Cheney,
                    almost always accompanied by General Powell, visited Sultan eight or nine times.
                    And we were always working that political aspect of his visit. Cheney would also
                    go and consult with CENTCOM and that was totally under CENTCOM's venue. In terms
                    of orchestrating the political leaders meetings, we would take the lead there
                    and also obviously coordinate very closely with CENTCOM. It was very much
                    focused on travel to Jeddah. I went to Dhahran I think once; and I went up to
                    the border with a VIP (Very Important Person) once. That's after our marines had
                    just gotten up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: According to Chas Freeman, he spent an inordinate amount
                        of time escorting VIPs, many Congress people who wanted to see the troops
                        and all. Did you get involved in much of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes. In this orchestration you've got a CODEL (Congressional Delegation)
                    who wants to come to the kingdom and the major focus here is to meet the troops.
                    But he's coming to the kingdom and so he, or they, will also meet with the Saudi
                    leadership. This is more of a political issue than it is a political/military
                    issue. That will be the portion of the trip that the embassy will work and that
                    will be done by another section, the Political Section. (laughs) And then they
                    will be taken over by the CENTCOM people who will move them into the troop
                    inspection and the photo opportunities and address their keen interests. This is
                    what Ambassador Freeman was talking about. It was a constant. I think the
                    embassy wanted to make sure that these congressional leaders knew, number one,
                    what the role of the kingdom was and how vital its partnership was, and also to
                    underline to the Saudis the importance by having so many visitors come. It
                    culminated of course with the president's visit out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The time before the actual war, which really didn't last
                        that long, while the troops were building up there, did you get involved in
                        working with our military to tell them how the troops should behave and then
                        working on this? Because even in the nicest, easy areas putting half a
                        million American young boys and women into an area is upsetting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: This was the issue that we worked most closely with J-5 on. As I was
                    explaining earlier, these books on guidancregulations on what you can do; how to
                    best accommodate yourself when you're in the Saudi environmensquibs on Saudi
                    mores, Saudi culture, Saudi customs, Saudi history. It was a delicate issue that
                    I would raise, in the sense of how you conduct your own religious services in a
                    country in which the predominant theme everywhere is Islam. That's a very
                    sensitive issue and I know it's come up from time to timhow best to do that and
                    to avoid any possibility of misperception, but I think it was accomplished.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you work this? I mean obviously you have chaplains
                        with the troops and they conduct services, including Jewish services. What
                        sort of guidance was there and how did you work it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Well it was a military issue in the sense of what the military has to do.
                    Normally if you are in an environment that is yourlike a large camthen what you
                    do inside, as long as it's done in an appropriate manner, like a simple service,
                    that's fine. We would have certain approaches like that, and then they would
                    implement them in the field. We would find more often they were extremely
                    sensitized to the need to keep that smooth. There were all sorts of issues that
                    the military had to work on the phone. When you're in the field, rubbing up
                    against the rural Saudis, this was an issue that I know they were really
                    preoccupied with. We didn't have to get involved in that. Then there were claims
                    issues. An errant artillery shell blows up a camel or you drive a tank across
                    somebody's date orchard or something. They were very sensitive to these issues.
                    We didn't really have to work with them on it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about women in our armed forces? At this point women
                        were an integral part; they weren't token.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: They were indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In fact I was in Korea in 1976 when we had a border
                        incident on the demilitarized zone and in those days female personnel are
                        supposed to get out of the war zone and the commanding general there, as we
                        went on high alert, said, “Hell with it. We can't run a war because
                        wometruck drivers, military police, and all thihave to be there.” And
                        certainly by 1990 they were a major component.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Well I think it's a matter of record that General Schwarzkopf had a lot
                    of coordination with Khalid bin Sultan who was at that time his counterpart on
                    the Saudi side. A lot of these issues that we worked with J-5, General
                    Schwarzkopf would work with Khalid. I think our military was in a position to
                    see that certain things had to happen, and would happen. Our forces are unified
                    and there are men and women in it, that's just the way it is. When they moved
                    their headquarters into the Ministry of Defense headquarters there may have been
                    some initial apprehension on the part of Saudis seeing certain women officers,
                    and women soldiers dressed for combat, in the halls, but when they would go into
                    intelligence briefings and they would find out that the person who knew exactly
                    what they wanted to know happened to be a woman, that woman thing sort of
                    evaporated. It wasn't really there. That person became a person who knows the
                    intelligence brief or who knows something about communications equipment for an
                    F-15. That's what took over in large part. Also I think there was an acceptance,
                    and how quickly I don't know, by the Saudis of the fact that a certain
                    percentage of our drivers who happen to drive these trucks that are getting
                    these supplies to point “A” and point “B” are going to be women. You have any
                    problem with that? The answer was that the U.S. military drivers will drive the
                    vehicle.</p>
                <p>There were always rumors, and reports that become anecdotal, of an occasional
                    incident or two in a public place, but I think most of those were taken care of
                    and there was never any significanas I recall; I could be wrondisciplinary
                    breach on our side. One of the things that was extremely admirable about General
                    Schwarzkopor sensitivwas the immediate guidance that members of the U.S.
                    military would not drink in the kingdom. It was pretty much adhered to. There
                    was a pretty good esprit, I thought, among the military there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you've alluded to this before, but was there the
                        feeling at a certain point that it was pretty obvious we were going to go
                        in? You know, if you put a half a million troops there you can't keep them
                        there for too long. Did you have the feeling that a clock was ticking and
                        they, you know, were going to “use them or lose them?”</hi>

                <p>PIERCE: It's the Greek play. That's just the feeling I had. Slowly but surely.
                    The thing that was so interesting about that is Saddam had many chances to have
                    reduced that possibility and he didn't take them. He did the exact opposite
                    instead of coming out with a token show of conciliation. An interesting scenario
                    would be to have moved out of Kuwait except for the oil fields that were being
                    contested. What would that do to the Arab nation component of the coalition? He
                    could've thought of these things but he didn't. So, in essence he basically
                    remained totally intransigent. There were several attempts, I think, to offer
                    some graceful way for him to pull back and he didn't take them.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: I'd have to go back and look. No, we didn't have any real ability to
                    coordinate with these people. We and the British, and perhaps two more embassies
                    were proactive in the political-military aspect of the relationship. I don't
                    recall other embassies having that same role. They could have, but it wasn't
                    that obvious. I didn't have any contacts in the political-military aspect in the
                    Syrian Embassy, or in the Egyptian Embassy.</p>

                        had troops on the ground.</hi>

                <p>PIERCE: They did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get into a consultation role or asking what they

                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Not on any regular basis. I think I might have had one or two
                    conversations with a British counterpart; with the French, no. Not to any great
                    degree. Mainly, as I recall, most of that coordination was worked out at a
                    MIL/MIL level. And CENTCOM, CINC, would have relationships with certain other
                    military officers in trying to forge a common approach on a variety of issues.
                    I'm not sure about that. Obviously, greater coordination occurred in the
                    multilateral naval forces. We did get very involved in Japanese support simply
                    because we were very active in coordinating with the Japanese. They sent a vast
                    amount of assistance. Their assistance was in large part sent into CENTCOM and
                    through their embassy. We got into pretty frequently contact with the Japanese,
                    facilitating their contact with CENTCOM in the sense of when they would send
                    their assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up a different spirit from the contacts

                        war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No. There're two different things. As I mentioned at the beginning of
                    this our presence began to bruise sensitivities within certain Saudi circles.
                    The good example which is used all the time now is bin Laden saying that the
                    Saudi government basically allowed sacred Saudi soil to be stained by
                    foreigners, by unbelievers. That issue was working itself in any great degree
                    around Riyadh during the buildup towards the fight. It might've been in certain
                    circles, but it wasn't an issue that was prevalent on the streets. I don't think
                    anybody therany Saudunderestimated the threat. I would find that over the years
                    my contacts would say they do know quite a lot about what's going on; they're
                    not quite that na�ve. They were fully aware of the threat coming out of Kuwait.
                    We had tens of thousands of Kuwaitis coming through Riyadh and Dhahran. It was
                    not as though we were living in a vacuum. They did not underestimate the dangers
                    to them. The hype on gas masks was extremely sharp and there was a sense of
                    vulnerability, but I don't think there was any negative reaction against our
                    presence there to address that vulnerability.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The war was over rather quickly. Well, we had the air war

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Quickly enough. Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then we had, what, about three or four days? What was

                </p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes, I understand. It was a difficult issue at the time to make the

                        were not getting instructions to say, “If they surrender, you will ask for
                        this and that.” Sort of the lack of?</hi>

                <p>PIERCE: No end game.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An end game, you know. It was sort of remarkable that
                        there really wasn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: This is true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I was wondering whether this was apparent at the time.
                        I mean to you all on the ground.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I'm trying to think if that as an issue ever came up. When you're in a
                    situation that is so difficult and with a heavy agenda you are trying to work on
                    a daily basis, your longer-term thinking is not always on Iraq or on the greater
                    regional picture. It always was on the kingdom and the relationship that the
                    military has with the kingdom. So it was an issue that would come up, but it
                    wasn't an issue that we were charged with focusing on. Freeman had a more
                    comprehensive picture to look at than we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the war ended was there a feeling of exhilaration or
                        was there one of “let's get these troops out of here?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No, as I said before, the stars came out again. You could leave. It's not
                    like you wanted to leave, but to know that you couldn't leave if you wanted to
                    was not a positive feeling. You have a feeling of a darkness; and that darkness
                    was gone. Immediately there was resuscitation of life in the city and people
                    just had a greater spring in their step. The whole issue of working out the UN
                    resolutions and getting the Iraqis to sign them and then setting up the regimes
                    that would be responsible for assuring that they were complied with, ultimately
                    to set up the no-fly zonthat was farther down the road. The beginning of
                    rebuilding of Kuwait, these were the priorities that were the focus at the time.
                    And then the slow but steady diminution of U.S. forces and other foreign forces
                    out of the area.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The preoccupation after the war was to take advantage of the situation,
                    to assure greater military cooperation on the ground so as to have a much
                    greater capability as a deterrent as well of an actual preventer of any
                    recurrence of this type of aggression. That was the main issue after the war

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling on your part or maybe your

                        was stronger than before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: You would have to look more carefully at the CENTCOM's evaluation than
                    mine, but I think there were several bright spots in the Saudi approaches and
                    there were several deficiencies. I think one of the things that we expressed
                    great amazement at is when they initially deployed their M-60 tanks, sometimes
                    as far away as the southwest up to the Kuwait border, they did it, and it was
                    not an easy thing to do for any military. Their pilots performed admirably.
                    Their Saudi National Guard demonstrated an extreme superiority of fighting, and
                    not always with the best of equipment. There were other coordinative problems
                    that again I'm not an expert on. There was an evaluation and no one is going to
                    say that the Saudi army or military was perfect or anything close to it, but you
                    recognize its weaknesses and its strengths and you try to build on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So by the time you left how did you feel about the way

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: One of the things that did occur, which I felt was a great success on our
                    paralthough again we can always question iis that, with the war and the
                    evolution of Saudi-U.S. military cooperation, we got to the point that we became
                    extremely positive to Saudi arms proposals and were in a position to basically
                    constitute a massive, very large, very long-term assistance program that would
                    put them in very good stead. To me that was a very positive thing, culminating
                    with the sale of F-15.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ground attack.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Had the ground attack capability with some modification, off the F-15 E
                    as I recall. The more problematic issue was how we approached military
                    cooperation with the Saudis on the ground in the kingdom. Our suggestions had to
                    be counter posed with this vulnerability that the Saudis have to criticism
                    internally and externally. By the time I left it was obvious that this was not
                    the most productive aspect of our military dialogue. It had potential, it was
                    working, but it was a learning process. It was not always easy to convince
                    people in Washington how to go about doing it. And there I left it and I don't
                    really know the end result of that.</p>

                    secretary of state. Offices like Dennis Ross's office; offices like the Office
                    of Counterterrorism. I am missing a significant bureau that I handled
                    assignments to. In total there were about eleven bureaus and offices and embassy
                    sections that I was in charge of assignments to.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because this is one of the best ways for people to move on

                        this. How did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The relationship of Seventh Floor offices, offices of sub-cabinet level
                    individuals and the secretary, is one of tension with the personnel system.
                    While a number of positions at that level went through normal assignment
                    procedures, there were always several positions up there that ultimately did not
                    follow strict personnel procedures for assignments. In some cases where the
                    senior official wanted a specific individual for the position, it was so
                    difficult to do that you would find frequently that the director general of
                    Personnel would have to designatit was “she” at the time; Mrs. Genta Holmehad
                    that authority to do, and the position would be uncontested through the regular
                    assignment process. I could exercise prerogatives that normally assignments
                    officers would not be able to do, to assure that a candidate that an office or a
                    senior official wanted had a very good chance, if not an absolute chance, to get
                    it.</p>
                <p>You have three different types of systems up there. Number one, you had the DG
                    directed system and this is where you had a candidate who was just simply not
                    going to conform with all assignment procedures and the senior officer really
                    wants that person. Two, you had special prerogatives or rules that the
                    assignments officer could use to enable the Seventh Floor position to be filled
                    by a candidate that a senior officer wanted. And three, you had others that fell
                    into the normal system. By and large most of those positions were filled through
                    the normal assignments process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now what would happen? one of the reasons so many people
                        are willing to work very long hours and all up there is they are seen and
                        they are tabbed as being comers or special people. But what about coming out
                        from thernot I guess at the senior officer level, but at the mid-grade
                        levewere you getting directives to give this person a good job, or were they
                        naming their jobs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Very often. After a junior officer or a mid-term officer completes a tour
                    up there, usually that person can get the backing or concurrence of the person
                    they worked foin other words, a very senior officiato support him or her for an
                    ongoing position somewhere else. And obviously if you are evaluating candidates
                    for position “A,” if undersecretary of something calls you up and says, “Hey, I
                    like Anne for that job. She's really quite good,” you're going to be somewhat
                    hard-pressed to say, “Gee I've got somebody else.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>PIERCE: But that normally does not affect the Personnel processing so much as it
                    affects the candidates that the individual offices or bureaus would support for
                    a non Seventh Floor position. For example, a deputy director job in a country
                    desk somewhera candidate coming from a Seventh Floor position with his or her
                    boss backing that person has an extra chance to get it just by virtue of the
                    support that the senior level official might give that candidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention that you were in charge of staffing the
                        Political-Military Bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now one of the complaints or comments that I've gotten
                        from people in recent yearI've never served there and I've been retired now
                        for some time, so I'm speaking from other peoples' points of vieis that the
                        Political-Military Bureau used to be considered one of the up-and-coming
                        places to go and they had some very bright, young officers going into it.
                        But they're saying that this has become more and more an area of Civil
                        Servants. How did you find it during your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: In the Political-Military Bureau you could divide the positions into
                    three types. You had several, but not an awful lot, of very solid positions that
                    offered extremely interesting, very hard, very high-level work. Also,
                    unfortunately, you had a number of jobs that were much less significant. Number
                    crunching jobs. Not very significant jobs, not very high visibility jobs, just a
                    lot of hard work. They did not attract a lot of people in many cases and the
                    potential for onward assignments for an officer there was based more on that
                    person's experience perhaps than other bureaus. In many cases it was not an easy
                    sell for a candidate coming off of these number crunching jobs in PM to be
                    competitive in other positions outside the PM Bureau. And then you had a
                    significant number of jobs in PM that were decent jobs and were not numbing by
                    the numbers. So you had three different types of jobs there.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>The other problem PM had was reorganization. They were always reorganizing. There
                    was a significant reorganization when I first came into Personnel. What the
                    reorganization problem is, is when you reorganize you rewrite your position
                    descriptions, you recategorize your jobs, the job work level, who is being
                    supervised by whom, what the different office tasks are, etc. But you're always
                    behind in the sense that the system itself hasn't taken hold and ingrained those
                    positions into the computer system. There's always a final act of approval;
                    there's always some detail missing so you don't really get that position quickly
                    into the personnel system. So you assign in an ad hoc way. You create personnel
                    numbers and assign people into them in close consultation with the bureau, but
                    they're not real numbers yet. You can't really do the honest assignments into
                    the system until everything is regularizeand sometimes this would take months.
                    And in some cases, very astoundingly, it could take years. You would have people
                    leaving domestic positions in which they were not in the system to begin with
                    although they had always been paid. But they did not have accurate records
                    thanks to the fact that the system itself had not incorporated that position
                    that they'd served for two years in, into the system. Very frustrating in any
                    case, but you had to keep the assignments going. You had to make things
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Foreign Service assignments process is pretty much a
                        competitive one because we have an “up or out” service and there are certain
                        jobs that give you a far greater visibility than other jobs, and therefore
                        the assignment process is part of the competitive process. How did you find
                        that NEA did in getting what you considered as you looked at your clientele,
                        how did you feel that you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I need to give you a clearer idea of how the system worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Within Personnel you had two different spheres. You had the assignments
                    officers and the assignments officers basically worked within Personnel but for
                    the bureaus of the offices that were trying to staff. On the other hand you had
                    the Career Development Officers (CDOs) this was a system that was changed in
                    '9that looked after the individual Foreign Service Officers. By and large,
                    people who would bid on jobs, people who would become candidates for assignments
                    into various jobs, would primarily go into the bureaus and be interviewed and
                    basically try to tell the responsible person there why that person was good for
                    the job. Now out of those candidates, normally then the bureau or the office
                    involved would select one that it wanted, and informally, in many cases, contact
                    that person to see if that person was really interested keenly in that job. And
                    that person would become that bureau's candidate.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>Normally, in most cases, the Career Development Officer, working for the cliennot
                    for the office, for the individuawould find out obviously if the person were
                    keenly interested or would take the job. If there would be a mesh, a meld, the
                    position would go through smoothly. That's what happened for most positions.
                    Frequently, however, what would happen would be that the bureau wanted one
                    candidate, but then another Foreign Service Officer, through his CDO, would also
                    want that job. So then you would have a conflict. This ended up being settleif
                    it couldn't be settled outside through alternate jobs coming up or alternate
                    candidates coming up from the bureain what is known almost notoriously as a
                    “shoot-out” within the Personnel Office, where we would assemble once a week to
                    sit down and thrash out the better candidate for the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The assembly would consist of whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The assembly would consist of the executive section in the assignments
                    office within Personnel. It would also consist of all of the assignments
                    officers for all of the various bureaus. I think there were about five of us. It
                    would consist of all of the heads of the various CDO offices. The heads of the
                    political sections; political officers, the econ officers, the admin officers.
                    They would sit down as well as other key bodies within the Career
                    Development/Personnel assignments process. The officer in charge of training, an
                    officer who basically looked after their personnel matters. That's about it.
                    Probably about 11 or 12 voting members in this assembly. In that situation the
                    position in contention would be outlined by the assignments officer, who would
                    describe what was needed. That would be the job of the assignments officer. In
                    this type of case you would have two candidatethe one the bureau wants and the
                    one the bureau does not want, but the CDO for that candidate and the CDO for the
                    bureau candidate would both be backing their respective clients. And then each
                    one of them would outline the background of the clients and make the case as to
                    why that specific client merited the job. Then there would be an open time for
                    discussion and then you would have a vote. The candidate that got the largest
                    number of votes would be assigned the job. Those could get quite tense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the problems that occurs sometimes is that it's
                        hard for people to break into a bureau if they've been out for a while or
                        something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an effort to say, “Somebody ended up in Science
                        and Oceans,” or something like that, “but he wants to get into Near Eastern
                        Affairs?” Was much done about this or did you find that people would be kind
                        of frozen?</hi>

                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>PIERCE: It's difficult to remember precisely, but in many occasions it could
                    happen. What would happen in some cases though is you've got a person who has
                    been in a bureau like environments/oceans and aspires to a very specific select
                    job in a regional bureau, one that the regional bureau might want to use as a
                    reward for someone who slugged it out in Baghdad, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Or who has put in fourteen-hour-day work on the Lebanese Desk or
                    something. I would make the case primarily based on guidance from the specific
                    bureau involved, but sometimes on my own idea that there was another job in the
                    bureau perhaps and not seen as a reward a job well done, that the person had a
                    decent chance at.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was somebody overall looking and saying, you know, here I
                        am representing the NEA; are we getting the people we want or is the
                        European Bureau gobbling them up or what-have-you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That again would be a bureau issue. It's not a Personnel issue. We would
                    treat all candidates as candidates and the quality of personnel in each bureau
                    was an issue for them to mull, not for us. Oftentimes we'd get a bureau that
                    would want to go after a string of candidates that might seem unusual, but they
                    would outline a strategy for that and you would try your best to accommodate the
                    Personnel system with making that happen. But it's they who do the outreach
                    work; it's they who do the recruiting for these types of jobs.</p>
                <p>The thing that you would get into is when you would have positions that would
                    draw very limited bidding; bidders that a bureau might look upon as just not
                    adequatthe quality or the size or the number of peoplfor them to make a good
                    decision. So you'd be aware of these vacanciethese positions that were duand you
                    would look carefully and see if you could come up with alternate candidates that
                    were in the system looking for jobs but just hadn't focused on those particular
                    jobs. And you would try the sell. You would try the sell sometimes with the
                    individual, but mainly an assignments officer did not work with individual FSOs.
                    The assignments officer would make the approach to the CDO of that person
                    because this is where, under this system, the CDO had the responsibility for
                    apprising clients of what the CDO thought was a good match, and doable.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>From time to time you would have an FSO who was adamant that he or she wanted
                    this specific job and even in the face of the CDO's advice perhaps that this may
                    not be the best match, that person would be adamant. Ultimately it would end up
                    being that the CDO representing the client, the FSO, would demand a shoot-out
                    for a certain position. And then you have a shoot-out. It would be the job of
                    the other CDO, whose FSO was the candidate from a bureau, to outline the reasons
                    why the bureau's candidate was the better choice. Almost certainly in situations
                    of that nature the assignments officer would be as supportive as possible since
                    the bureau is the client of the assignments officer of that CDO's position.</p>
                <p>Now there's always the suspicion that the deck was stacked against FSOs that were
                    trying to buck the system, trying to buck a bureau's selection. I found in
                    shoot-outs that of those 10 to 12 people who were sitting in judgment making the
                    final call you had represented there, not only assignments officers whose
                    clients were bureaus, but also CDOs who were very attuned to the needs of
                    candidates. And you had two or three individuals who were neither CDOs nor
                    assignments officers. You have these debates and sometimes it would get heated,
                    but the exchanges were reasonably neutral and a bureau was not favored in an
                    automatic inclinational way. It just did not happen that way. Any time there is
                    an objection by anybody at the table you either explain it and overcome it or
                    that position is held until the objection is sorted out. You lost a few. After
                    these panel meetings you would call your client bureaus and you would tell them
                    who got assigned and who didn't, and why. Sometimes those conversations could be
                    just a bit tense. Bureaus didn't always appreciate the fact that their candidate
                    didn't get paneled that week, or lost. You know they have someone they did not
                    want to see in those jobs. The odd thing about it is that if you look clearly
                    over a year's span after the assignments process, after somebody who has been
                    put into the bureau or into an embassy against the bureau's wishes, in many
                    cases those persons worked just as well, if not better, than the other person
                    might have. And what's really important to get assigned one week is totally
                    irrelevant a month later. It's all a passion of the moment issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've been doing these oral histories now for almost 16
                        years and one of the things I was getting from an earlier generation of
                        officers with senior ranks was that they would be assigned as General
                        Services Officer to some post and they thought, “Oh God, how awful,” but the
                        expression again was that you stood up and saluted and went. But often they
                        said, “You know, the job that I thought that would be the worst turned out
                        to be one of the greatest learning experiences and fun or everything else
                        that I've ever had.” How is it during the time when you were there, where
                        it's a much more negotiated procedure and all? There must've been an awful
                        lot of jobs that just nobody wanted.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Exactly. I was in charge of the “hard to fill exercise.” The “hard to
                    fill exercise” is a Department-wide exercise mainly for overseas positions, but
                    also for some positions in the Department that got inadequate bids by candidates
                    at the level appropriate. In other words, it's an O-2 position and all you got
                    were O-3s or O-4s bidding on it. Or maybe one or two O-2s. It was a system
                    whereby bureaus and embassies could designate positions that were hard to fill,
                    and that enabled you to relax the criteria for assignments and also give some
                    incentive to better talk up those jobs. You had a significant number of them in
                    some AF (Bureau of African Affairs) posts, mainly around the Sahara. It waxed
                    and waned. The “stans” always had their fair share of problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Kazakhstan, Tajikistan?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Other positions would be difficult to fill because of environmental
                    issues, an occasional one or two, for example Mexico City. Colombia might be
                    difficult from time to time given the situation there. It just really depended.
                    But you would go through an exercise in which you would try to make it easier to
                    entrap people into those places. Another thing you would do is raise the
                    differential if you could. That was a very difficult exercise because at the
                    time the Department was trying to reorganize the criteria; the end result meant
                    a number of posts lost 5 percentage points off their differentials. You would
                    try to come up with ways in which you could entice people with monetary gain to
                    bid on these jobs. It was a problem.</p>
                <p>The issue that you raise, though, is that you used to salute and go out and do
                    it. I had my share of these positionnot necessarily of the “hard to fill”
                    exercise type, but not easy to fill. Pakistan got very dangerous during that
                    time and we had some problems trying to fill some slots there. Algeria, of
                    course, had difficulty simply because you couldn't do anything there. You were
                    in the compound and they were killing people just outside. Lebanon had problems
                    like that before but it pretty much situated itself. Both Beirut and Algiers at
                    the time were hardship posts with danger pay, which is a significant financial
                    incentive for people raking on one-year assignment. Others were just difficult
                    to fill; not necessarily in NEA, but around the world.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>You never really wanted to force a person to a place like that. The reason is if
                    you live in a tight environment, which is difficult anyway and could turn even
                    worse, you don't want to see a person there who can't pull it. You just don't.
                    So you want to be very careful of, yes, you want to fill the position, but no,
                    you do not want to force someone into that position who could become a liability
                    in a bad situation. Bureaus at the time were beginning to resort to other ways
                    to fill these positions. WAEs (When Actually Employed) were coming in as
                    possibilities, and contract employees. Long-term TDY. These were primarily jobs,
                    as I recall at the time, jobs such as the junior or the GSO in a “stan.” The
                    other thing would be that bureaus would have to work extra hard in enticing
                    people in with promises of those select positions later; “if you come in and
                    take this job, we can see what we can do about that job which you really
                    want.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things I picked up by both experience and
                        listening to gossip is that you can't trust a person who promises something
                        will happen two years later, but you go back than, and it is a little like
                        Willie Loman, who says that promises were made.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: That's right. But these were not promises within Personnel; these were
                    promises by the bureau. The Personnel system can not promise you onward
                    assignments or that you will have a solid reputation in bureau “A” if you go to
                    this job. It's a bureau thing. That still doesn't eliminate the problem. Of
                    course the problem is there. But it's an incentive and if you do well in a bad
                    environment you will earn credits in the bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I was going to say, in a shoot-out or something or
                        even before that, if somebody has just come out of a “stan” and lived in a
                        hotel under very difficult circumstances for a while, I imagine that the
                        career counselor would present this saying, “Look, this person has earned
                        their bonus; we owe them something.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The argument has merit and it has been used. In essence I think in a
                    situation of that nature, all things being equal, the assignments panel will
                    tend toward the individual who's just had the hardship. The job of the opposing
                    side is to basically present the case as to why the other candidate offers
                    vastly better qualifications for that particular job. You don't really want to
                    go into the personal aspects. Though you don't talk about personal aspects of
                    individuals, you can suggest that the person that's aspiring to that job would
                    be better qualified elsewhere. It's not a very polite way, but in very few cases
                    it does become an issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>The Personnel system takes the position that everybody who is a candidate for a
                    job is qualified on paper unless it's an O-4 aspiring to an O-2 position or an
                    obvious bad mix. Any legitimate O-3 admin officer has a fair shot at any
                    legitimate O-3 admin position. It's for the sides that are discussing a position
                    to make the case while not suggesting that one is not qualified for the job, but
                    that the mix is better for the other. It's a delicate issue. Personalities
                    always intrude into this. It doesn't get really heated in the sense of acrimony,
                    but at the same time you can have some very compelling arguments and the tension
                    is in the discussion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After all the processing is done there must be a group,
                        significant or not significant, of those nobody really wants. I mean
                        whatever their recommendation is they're not considered candidates by most
                        bureaus. I mean they just don't want them. I think the term I've heard used
                        in other eras is “the turkeys.” Which I always avoid because it's so easy to
                        get a bad reputation by one or two people badmouthing you who don't
                        understand the situation that today's turkey may be tomorrow's water-walker.
                        But still, what did you do with the hard to place people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: They were always at the end of a personnel assignments cycle. The
                    positions that weren't filled and officers that for one reason or another had
                    not been assigned. There are a variety of reasons why. One is the one you just
                    outlined; others could be that Mr. “A” was the number 2 choice here and then he
                    went and he got paneled for another position and then that position was
                    eliminated, etc., etc., or it could just be that people want to stand and watch
                    until the system sorts itself out and something might pop up at the end of a
                    personnel cycle, which it does although it's a big gamble. In situations that
                    you're outlininwhere you have questions about an officer, like why has this
                    person been at grade for 12 years? that suggests something about the person.
                    It's not a tell-tale sign but it suggests it.</p>
                <p>In the end you will have assignments that have laid open for a number of
                    reasonthey may be positions that most people would consider unsatisfyinand you
                    will have a CDO who will propose a person for those positions. In those cases
                    many bureaus are prepared to accept candidates for these positions, and will
                    accept what they got and that's the result. I don't think you will ever see a
                    candidate for assignment who just plain can not get a job. At the end of the
                    cycland I was not a Career Development Officer so I don't know how these
                    dialogues woryou would have jobs out there that were just open, and as a CDO,
                    you would basically tell your candidate, “make your choice.” Once the choice was
                    made you would confer with the assignments officer involved, or with the bureau
                    directly, and the bureau may or may not object.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the “up or out” standards as far as
                        promotion goes and the fact that you had so many years to show that you had
                        supervised and all of this, did this make the system a little difficult to
                        manage, because people would be put in jobs that might make them, by the
                        systems standards, ineligible to be promoted?</hi>

                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>PIERCE: That's correct. Not ineligible, but certainly it would weaken the
                    credentials that one must have to be likelier to be promotable. If you don't
                    have supervisory experiencthis gets into the political officers, primarily, but
                    they end up being protected in other ways, I think, and this was simply the way
                    the system workebut if you don't have supervisory experience at a certain level
                    then you become far less of an attractive candidate if you aspire to a job with
                    a significant management criterion as a key aspect of that job. You have no
                    background in management. It's kind of hard to aspire to a DCM job if you've
                    never on paper managed anyone.</p>

                    and I did some investigation and it seemed that on that bid list no one had
                    prior Indonesian experience, and the requisite supervisory background was
                    present, so I got paneled for the job.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: Surabaya is the second largest city in Indonesia; it's on the eastern
                    part of the island of Java in Indonesia. Jakarta being on the western side. It
                    is the second most important city within the country. It is within the Javanese
                    ethnic heartland as opposed to Jakarta, which is not. It was the second largest,
                    by far, commercial center in the country; well developed infrastructure, an
                    awful lot of money being pumped in and a lot of exports. At the time it was a
                    growing foreign investment center and modernization had made a dramatic impact
                    there. In essence it had become almost an internationaat least a Southeast
                    Asiacenter with direct airline transport coming in and going out. We were able
                    to make the case for having a consulate there in terms of advancing commercial
                    interests. A number of firms had set up their regional headquarters there given
                    its location, given its transportation infrastructure, given its direct access
                    into the market of millions of people, as well as its proximity to natural
                    resources.</p>
                <p>The consular district was large. It began in Central Java, went into East Java
                    where Surabaya was, and then extended all the way out to West Timor, not East
                    Timor. It then went up north and included the island of Sulawesi and the Maluku
                    Islands, now undergoing such tremendous ethnic religious turmoil. It had the old
                    traditional cultural Javanese capital of Yogyakarta. So it was very, very
                    large.</p>
                <p>One of the wonderful things about that job is that you had basicallnot an
                    inexhaustiblbut a very sufficient amount of travel funds. I approached that
                    position in a way that though you live in Surabaya, your job was to find out
                    what was going on, see it, and develop contacts in the eastern half, virtually,
                    of Indonesia, about 90 million people. It was a tremendous challenge. I like to
                    think I had all of the best places in the country to visit from a sense of sheer
                    beauty, but also by far some of the most interesting developments from a
                    political standpoint.</p>
                <p>There were two things about the job. Firstly, prior to my getting to the
                    position, in respect to how it related to the embassy, there had been little
                    interest in developing political contacts. That changed just prior to my coming
                    with the arrival of Ambassador Stapleton Roy. I was charged with developing
                    political contacts, which I did much to my great benefit ultimately. The other
                    thing, of course, was the dramatic rise in the economy there and our tremendous
                    commitment towards strengthening the commercial side of things across Indonesia.
                    And Surabaya had an excellent potential for that up until the economic
                    collapse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember, have you had Indonesian before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: I have a 4/4 in Indonesian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your political contacts? What was your
                        impression of them as political leaders, how the political system
                        worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>PIERCE: This was in the last year of Suharto's complete control of the system. At
                    the end of my first year is when he became loose and then ultimately fell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you first arrived.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Developing political contacts at that time was difficult. Firstly,
                    virtually everyone in the system was co-opted. I was able to begin to have some
                    small contacts with political leaders, political party people, who had the
                    potentiawhich was proven outo get beyond that. But aside from that you basically
                    began to expand your contacts in the human rights area. The other thinand this
                    was mainly on Java that I'd do thiyou would do is to talk with people at Gadjah
                    Mada, perhaps the best university in the country. It's in Yogyakarta. Not the
                    most renowned; that's the University of Indonesia in Jakarta, but it's a close
                    second. But the embassy had, for years, had interlocutors amongst the academics
                    there and you began to develop those. And from that you find others. We had
                    long-standing academic contacts in the local universities in Surabaya. You
                    developed those again. They were pretty well disposed to the consulate; it was
                    very easy to maintain the dialogue. But you expand them; you look at people that
                    traditionally the consulate hasn't had contact with.</p>
                <p>It's amazing that the academics ended up being critical in the fall of Suharto.
                    When I first got there I would've never imagined that, but the key ones were
                    invaluable in propelling the student movement which was the beginning of the
                    erosion of his base. In Sulawesi it was far more difficult. The first year I was
                    there, it was very, very difficult in the city of Makassaat the time called
                    Ujung Pandanwhich is the key city in Sulawesi. I went there several times. It
                    was under much tighter control; the political process was more tightly enforced;
                    people were far more wary of talking; and the military was far more interested
                    in me than I like for them to be.</p>
                <p>Whenever I went anywhere in the district I always tried to make contact with the
                    local regional commander, normally a two-star general, the governor, and the
                    chief of police. Just as a protocolary measure. I didn't expect much to come out
                    of those conversations. The military invariably, at that time, would see me.
                    Later it got more difficult when they began insisting that we had to go through
                    a rigid, almost impossibly difficult, protocolary arrangement to pay calls on
                    some military leaders.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>The first year I had some interesting conversations, did a lot of commercial
                    promotion; and then began to open contact in as broad a way as possible with
                    religious leaders. In the past, consul generals had always paid courtesy calls
                    on certain local key religious leaders, called “kiyayi,” and almost invariably
                    they control religious schools. And there were about three that were extremely
                    important and courtesy calls were always placed on them. I expanded that; one of
                    the first things I did was sought out the East Java leadership of something
                    called “Nahdlatul Ulama,” NU, which we did not have an awful lot of contact
                    with. And I was most fortunate, after an initial sort of reservation on their
                    part, to meet a man named Mr. Hasyim Muzadi, who was the head of NU in East Java
                    and became a close friend. And through him I was able to be introduced, using
                    his name, to other kiyayi in East Java as well as Central Java, and that has
                    been one of the most rewarding things I've ever done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine that being of the Muslim faith must've
                        been somewhat startling to them at the beginning, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Not really. I think the way that Indonesians approach that is a very
                    laissez faire ad hoc way. Once well after the time I met Mr. Hasyim Muzadi I was
                    sitting with him and I had one of my employees with me whom I always took to see
                    him and it came out that I was Muslim and Mr. Muzadi said, “That is no business
                    of mine.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there obviously you were in close touch
                        with our embassy and all. What was the consensus of whether Suharto and
                        whither Indonesia when you got there in '96?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The embassy was going through an intense dialogue over the effectiveness
                    of the Suharto regime and its future prospects. At the time the Suharto regime
                    had been in place since '66. It was looked upon conventionally as bequeathing an
                    economic miracle to the country, and admittedly, the prosperity of Indonesia and
                    the average Indonesian had gone up. There was a trickle down affect, although
                    those at the top got immensely richer than that. The dialogue was, from what I
                    could tell, being in distant Surabaya, from time to time very sharp. But the
                    challenges to that belief, inherited from thirty some odd years, were difficult
                    to find formal expression of without an awful lot of proof. Therein the tension
                    lay.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>I, myself, one of the early things I did was attend a meeting, or a religious
                    ceremony, by President Suharto at a famous pesantren not far from Surabaya in
                    which Gus Dur, Abdurrahman Wahid, the current president, as national head of the
                    NU, was coming as well as Suharto. It was expected that there would be serious
                    tension, because they were not known as close. My reporting, describing a
                    Javanese situation where the tension was subsurface, was looked upon with some
                    skepticism. That was indicative you're looking at signs, you're not looking at
                    actualities, and you're trying to predict. Any time you do that in a situation
                    like this you could be wrong. It's very difficult to meet the burden of proof to
                    a degree that you would like to see. There are cracks in the feet of the statue;
                    that tension was there. It was only as the student demonstrations began to get
                    rowdier and rowdier, and more pointedly antagonistic to Suharto, that you began
                    to sense with greater confidence that the ship of state was not being steered
                    well. And you had a greater latitude to express the suggestion that maybe the
                    end was closer than farther away, which happened in Jakarta, in Yogyakarta and
                    in Surabaya. It also happened in other key cities. The student protest movement,
                    particularly in Surabaya, was one that my junior officer and I followed with
                    extreme care.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it must've been a tricky situation. Did the students
                        look upon us as the enemy? The helper? How did they look upon us, or were we
                        looked upon at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: We, from time to time, were looked upon. We were, unsurprisinglit happens
                    quite frequentlfrom time to time labeled the reason why Suharto had stayed
                    around so long. We were labeled as the proppers-up of a regime that was immoral,
                    that was bankrupt. At that time the economic collapse had already begun and the
                    IMF (International Monetary Fund) and the basic loans were being put in place.
                    And we were also looked upon, in some ways, as the destroyers of the Indonesian
                    economy, as intent on seeing the nation fragment. Now these issues would come
                    forth, wax and wane. There was no monolithic student view of things. There was
                    no monolithic student leadership. That's one of the reasons why it succeeded.
                    You cultivated contacts mainly through the academics but also through students.
                    And through priestthat was another way that we got into knowing what students
                    were doing. Priests in Surabaya, because so many of the students who were
                    spearheading the protest movement were Christians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would this be a Catholic priest?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Catholic priests primarily. We found Catholic priests to be extremely
                    good interlocutors. I think primariland it would be my guess and I always found
                    this to be the casbecause they had an organization. The Protestants were
                    independent. We did latch into some Protestants. One was a heart surgeon who got
                    upset in 1996 with the total burning of all of the churches in an area in East
                    Java called “Situbondo” burned out one day by moband began establishing his own
                    network to record and report religious intolerance and violence. He became an
                    extremely close friend. I exchanged views with him. I was amazed at how quickly
                    he was able to find concerned people, mainly Christians, who would be in a
                    position to tell him anywhere in the country where an example of a church
                    burning was happening or anything with a religious overtone that was erupting
                    into violence.</p>
                <p>Priests, I think were lower key. We are talking about workers on the ground, not
                    higher officials within the church, who would gain impressions from their
                    ministry to their communities at the grassroots level. This type of contact is a
                    long, long process. You sit and you talk and you drink tea and you swap stories.
                    You do it in January and then you come back and you do it in late February. You
                    just develop a rapport, and it's a laid back thing where you sit and you talk.
                    You've picked up things, they've picked up things; you swap. And then you're
                    sitting with someone in a community just outside of Surabaya and say, “I'm going
                    to southeast Central Java next week. Do you know anybody down there who I might
                    stop by and say 'hi' to?” and a name will pop up, and you'll try to see him.</p>
                <p>And you're going there for a number of reasons. Number one, it may be politically
                    interesting, but number two, more importantly in this particular case, because I
                    had had reports that there may be starvation down there. I was interested in
                    finding out just what people were eating. There were pockets of hunger in 1998,
                    '99, that I took extremely seriously. One of the things you'd always look at is
                    what poor people were eating. Were they eating rice? Were they relying more on
                    traditional tubers? How much of their diet was cassava? And, from that, where
                    did they get the nutrition from what you were looking at? You were trying to
                    estimate visibly, and as well as by talking to people, how the staple of the
                    diet had deteriorated in terms of nutrition. That was one reason why priests
                    were always in a very good position to give us advice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: You would feed that into the embassy. The south side of East Java always
                    had these reports. We would go down there and look, and talk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As these student demonstrations and all went on, was it
                        pretty soon apparent that the Suharto regime was not going to make it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>PIERCE: I don't think you could say it was pretty soon apparent. Students were
                    never going to be, in my view, the topplers of the regime. Whenever you would
                    have the beginnings of student protests you've got two different types of
                    people. You've got the students, the youngish twenty-somethings who have become
                    convinced that it's time for a change. They were extremely active in the '60s
                    when change was what they wanted. Then you have this community of impoverished
                    people who have absolutely nothing, who live in very impoverished conditions
                    with no prospects and little to do. Those that worked, worked hard. Those are
                    the ones who were looking for the basic staples. In cities with modernization
                    producing so much you have increasing masses attracted into town. Sometimes they
                    get income, sometimes they don't. When you began to have student protests, these
                    people began to look. They began to crowd along the streets; they began to
                    become attracted to the show. There's always a spirit of great show in the
                    Javanese Indonesian tradition and participation. That's the element of disorder.
                    When you begin to mix the two it moves into where control becomes questionable.
                    Ultimately this is what happened in Jakarta in May of '98, which ultimately was
                    the end of the Suharto regime. The students massed more and more people and had
                    a sheer show of great numbers. The other test that happens, that begins to
                    question the validity of the regime, is that you've got the military there. The
                    military has two things to do. The military/police. They have to control. You do
                    that through several ways; you do that through intimidation; you do that through
                    negotiation; and ultimately you can do that through force. Excess force. And
                    this is what began to happen.</p>
                <p>The military could not withstand the pressure. The police could not withstand the
                    pressure. You had the deaths of students. I would sit there in early '98 and
                    say, “Who is going to be the first student to die?” At the time it was just an
                    unthinkable thing. You knew leaders in universities and you just did not want to
                    see that happen. You would see the beginning of pushing on the militarvery
                    dramatic pictures. You could either look or you would see them in the papers.
                    Very dramatic pictures. And then fights; invariably the students would lose.
                    Blood, beaten heads oozing blood. Very dramatic. Tear gas in the air. You could
                    see that the test was there and as you began to see this test, you began to
                    question whether the military and the police could control the situation and
                    their own ability. That's what collapsed. And then the situation just went
                    chaotic. That was in April or May. It happened in Yogyakarta, but not so much.
                    It happened in Surabaya, but not so much. It happened in Jakarta terribly and it
                    happened in Solo terribly. I know I was in Solo the day it happened.</p>
                <p>I attribute the relative quiet in Surabaya to one thing: good, solid, strong
                    academic leadership which inspired students. The academics were never directly
                    involved but they exercised immense influence over students. And, oddly enough,
                    an enlightened military commander who worked very closely to try to ensure that
                    it didn't get too out of hand. It almost did, but it didn't. In Yogyakarta I
                    attribute it to the university leadership at Gadjah Mada, and most importantly
                    to the Sultan of Yogyakarta, Hamengkubuwono.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: I had seen this happen. You see it on a small scale; it happens from time
                    to time. Over the least imaginable issue. You could take a perfectly calm
                    marketplacbusand if you still shot that every 30 seconds, you could have one 30
                    seconds in which it would be just a basic busy market, but the next 30 seconds
                    you could have an incident. It could be anything. It could be some man saying,
                    “He stole my bike.” The next 30 seconds you could see that guy, whoever he is,
                    the suspect, surrounded, and the next 30 seconds you could see him dead. It does
                    happen. I saw this happen once in Ujung Pandanjust very shocking - where a
                    student in junior high school was standing with other students waiting for a bus
                    at six-thirty in the morning, and someone said, “He stole my wallet!” Suddenly
                    he was being chased by seven, eight, a crowd up to 20 other boys. He had lost
                    his shoes, he had fallen in the street, and they surrounded him and started
                    kicking him and then quit. He was able to sneak away. But it was extremely
                    hair-raising.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While these things were going on, how did you sense, as a
                        political officer by training, the attitude of the American leadership?
                        Stapleton Roy, the ambassador, others, and also Washington. Suharto had been
                        the general on the white charger as far as we were concerned back in '65 or
                        so. Did you feel there was a time when we were beginning to write him
                        off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The problem with that is that I was not in that direct relationship with
                    the embassy. Certainly writing him off is not the best way to express that. But
                    certainly we began to see that the situation was changing and that there needed
                    to be a dramatic realignment of power bases in the country. I began to sense
                    thaagain, not having direct access into embassy Country Team deliberationin
                    early April of '98. Suharto fell in May.</p>
                <p>We were expressing our reservations and our concern over the security situation.
                    As I recall we did not have major potential problems for foreigners, and
                    certainly not in Surabaya. Foreigners were secondary, tertiary; they were not on
                    the scope. A foreigner would be endangered only if by chance that person strayed
                    into a demonstration and that demonstration resulted in turmoil. And most
                    demonstrations didn't occur where foreigners went. You didn't have that problem;
                    this was a constant message that I kept reinforcing with the foreign community
                    in Surabaya, and in some cases in Bali. Bali was also in my district, where on
                    any given day we could have a thousand Americans. Bali, at the time, was
                    considered insulated from turmoil and there was a good reason for that.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>We were very watchful, but there was not much we could do except as human rights
                    violations were recorded and become obvious we took positions on them. That was
                    our main focus during March and April, although the economy obviously was an
                    underlying factor and another part of our policy. But in the political sense
                    it's not anything for us to do; you don't want to become directly involved. You
                    don't want even to be seen as directly trying to influence internal events.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine that just when it really gets interesting

                <p>PIERCE: I didn't avoid my contacts at all.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: The constant American position here is that we always support
                    democratization; we always support popular representation. We are not
                    interesteand this is the traditional viewe have no role in getting out in front
                    of the will of the people of Indonesia. We support the aspirations of the will
                    of the people of Indonesia. The political will. That was our long-expressed view
                    in the face of Suharto's autocracy. As their aspirations became more and more
                    for change, our position was apparently more attractive. But we did not get
                    beyond that. We weren't getting out in front of aspirations. There was no real
                    clear purpose here except a 19-year-old student saying, “Topple Suharto,” which
                    is hardly a position. And certainly not anything that the United States? Again,
                    we always support stability and orderly process and the rule of law. So these
                    are our standards. No one quibbles with them. No one quarrels with them. We do
                    not address ourselves to every shake and rumble that goes on in the country,
                    except where human rights comes to the fore. Then we have a clear policy, which
                    we did express.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of course we had the example of the overthrow of

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: In a public way we're distanced from what's going on inside the country.
                    To me, with my inner interlocutors, that was an extremely useful position. It's
                    one that I was comfortable with, I could articulate, I could defend, and they
                    almost invariably would appreciate it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you concerned or looking at who or what, if anything,
                        takes Suharto's place? Before everything was in red or white because of the
                        Communist thing, but this was no longer the main issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>PIERCE: What happened is Suharto resigned. The term that was used was “lengser;”
                    he went lengser keprabon. He stepped down to go into tranquility and aesthetic
                    meditation. He was replaced by his vice president, which I think most students
                    felt was not legitimate because the regime was illegitimate. But the
                    institutions accepted that and Mr. Habibie came in. Mr. Habibie was astute
                    enough to realize that he didn't have the full deck Suharto did to impose his
                    will. He began a pretty decent process of “reformasi,” which was what the
                    students lad called for, and had been taken up by the nation, trying to turn
                    things around, more open, freer, in terms of the press, in terms of the right to
                    free speech, and in terms of the political process. Which he did. And then also
                    to arrange the elections in '99, which he lost and stepped down from. Also his
                    other call, which many Indonesians question, is the plebiscite in East Timor.
                    These were things that he did within a very short time. So it diffused a lot of
                    the tension after the week or so of chaos surrounding Suharto's resignation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While this was happening, what were you observing in the
                        vibrant, economic city?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Well the economy had begun collapsing before that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: It was freezing up. The downspin was rather dramatic in the economy. The
                    poverty line, the amount of capital that people had, the potential for food. One
                    of the things I investigated in East Java, particularly, as the price of rice
                    skyrocketed, was the potential for rice traders to be attacked and rice mills to
                    be raided by peopljust the potential for violencand whether this could begin to
                    produce a string of violent incidents that would all be interrelated. One of the
                    things that Mr. Amien Raiwho's somewhat notorious now, he's the speaker of the
                    MPR (Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat); at the time he was the head of the
                    “Muhammadiyah,” which is the reform movement of significance in Indonesiused to
                    say before this was that Indonesia was like a dry rice field waiting for a
                    match, a spark. It would suddenly become inflamed and flames would whip across,
                    and it would be before anyone knew.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>I was always interested in seeing the wisdom of his remarks. If you began to have
                    riots or a food incident of violence in Malang, would that occasion a string of
                    incidents that could erupt in a conflagration. I had my doubts, but you just
                    didn't put it away as a minor issue. Always investigated it. Always went after
                    that potential and talked to the people involved. You would drive along the
                    sides of someplace on the roads of East Java near Tilomar, which was a city very
                    ominous to me. I didn't like it at all; I always felt it was potentially very,
                    very violent. I would stop and talk to rice threshers and see what their
                    situations were, how the attitudes of people around them would bwhether they
                    could make rice deliveries unimpeded. You would investigate how “BULOG,” the
                    national logistics command which distributed rice for poor people, was going,
                    and it wasn't going well. But there was a vast distribution network under BULOG
                    for distribution of rice to borderline survival families. You would investigate;
                    you would talk to people and see if it were happening. See if the deliveries
                    were being made, how the rice was being distributed from delivery points, how
                    much rice was there, how satisfying was it to people. You'd always go and look
                    at that. You would also check constantly on the price of rice. You'd stop
                    anywhere and you'd go in and you would ask, “How much is that kilo of rice?”
                    Always looking. Trying to make sure if the conflagration, or if something
                    resembling it were to occur, whether what you knew would gel with that reality.
                    And it never occurred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Americans in business there; would they come
                        and ask you, during this time, “Should we get out? Should we stay?” How
                        would you treat that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: There were a few American businessmen there who had asked the question.
                    Most of them would be at the beck and call of their headquarters in Jakarta or
                    in the States. Of course, if they were in the States, much like the Department
                    of State, they listen to CNN before they listen to the people on the ground. And
                    CNN, being in the business of making breathless reports, was not, I could say,
                    the most reliable place to get news.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: There was one significant group of American businessmen who were
                    reasonably content. Most others had left the country because of the economic
                    downturn; they were involved in projects. We started looking very aggressively
                    at where other Americans might be. We discovered a whole cache of TDYers. The
                    companies would not send in families; they would send in temporaries to work for
                    Indonesian companies and keep them in hotels. All of them had their own
                    evacuation plans. With that said, we would also make sure they knew we had one
                    as well. This is just something you would do. I mean it's not like we were
                    trying to say something is imminent; we were just trying to be prepared.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>We also began canvassing the more isolated groups in the district. There were
                    certain missionary groups up in Sulawesi we wanted to make sure we knew where
                    they were. We communicated our potential concern about the situation, always
                    finding out that in places like Sulawesi in '98, in the more isolated parts,
                    things just went along. You know, the birds sang in the morning and people cut
                    their rice and they went home at night. But they also had their own contingency
                    plans. This was also a good way for us to share impressions on local
                    conditions.</p>
                <p>We began to look more carefully at Balwe had done this earliewe had an office
                    with an American there. We've had it since the mid-'80s, I believe. A small
                    office, but he had a very good network of hotel connections, and again, Bali
                    being considered reasonably safe from this type of thing just simply because of
                    its environment. It was still very good, but we began to expand even more the
                    hotel connections that he had there. We began also to expand our own connections
                    with every three-star or better hotel in East Indonesia, on the premise that in
                    a situation of this nature if something were to happen, we couldn't find every
                    little nook and cranny the Americans might be in on every little island, but
                    they would probably gravitate, in one form or another, to the most developed
                    hotel just to find out what was happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: So we began finding three-star hotels in Palau, Central Sulawesi, and in
                    two or three more like Manado. We found some of them stuck in weird tourist
                    havens in Central Java. Always making sure we had connections with them just in
                    the event that they would be happy to post a sheet from us in certain
                    situations. One of the things that we found out when the problems in Maluku
                    exploded in 1999.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was after you'd left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: No, this was before I'd left. About six months before I left. This was in
                    January of 1999.</p>
                <p>We had always knew of two groups of Americans in Ambomainly missionary groupand
                    we presumed that the occasional person would come through who had heard about
                    the beaches, wanted to experiment, that kind of stuff. Well, when Maluku first
                    exploded it was very tumultuous, very difficult to communicate with. They got
                    out; they had charter aircraft go up and they were gone. Both of them. I
                    thought, that's finished. Then they started surfacing. It wasn't one, it wasn't
                    two, it was 45 Americans. By then connections outside were severed and it was
                    about a week of touch-and-go. It was even longer than that before we got the
                    final ones out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened in Maluku?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>PIERCE: Across the country, especially in places where ethnic mixes occur,
                    especially when ethnic mixes are of different religious backgrounds, and an
                    incoming group manages to get an economic toehold over the indigenous group.
                    That's what happened in Maluku. It happened in Kupang, and there was some
                    potential for it happening in some of the islands between Bali and West Timor.
                    It's happening in Kalimantan now, although that's not the area that I
                    specialized in. But whenever this happens you run the risk of having a religious
                    ethnic clash, mainly brought about by some of the underworld that tends to
                    permeate the fringes of the less privileged society of Indonesicommon gangsters
                    and thugs. Oftentimes one, unfortunately the Christian in those cases, is drunk
                    and they get into a fight. It happens all the time. Most of these incidents go
                    away, but if there is a sufficient combination of circumstance, if there is in
                    the immediate vicinity enough grudges against one group over the other, it can
                    get out of control. Now beyond getting out of control, you have to have another
                    factor to make it into a Maluku situation, and that is a reasonable balance
                    between the two conflicting groups. That's what you had in terms of the
                    Christians and the Muslim newcomers that were quickly allied, more often that
                    not, with some of the Muslim old timers.</p>
                <p>In Kupang you had the same situation in late '9maybe November of '9but the issue
                    there quickly went away because the incoming Muslims were outnumbered one to
                    twenty. There was a quick accommodation there. But not in Maluku, for a variety
                    of reasons but the primary one is that they weren't outnumbered one to twenty;
                    it was maybe fifty-fifty. In Ambong you didn't have that and each side could
                    make the point that the other side is destroying our way of life. There is a
                    tendency amongst Christians, which I often thought of as alarmist, but I'm not
                    Indonesian Christian, to fear that the Muslims were going to take over. They
                    would express this in the most simplistic of ways to me. “They're going to run
                    us out. They're going to cheat us. They're going to wipe out our way of life.”
                    Very, very hardcore alarm. I think that took fire especially in Maluku and
                    impelled the Christians, who had a pretty good hand in terms of position and
                    personnel, to fight much harder. Then it deteriorated into what we have today,
                    which is just a constant battle.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: Overt, open suggestions of questioning the integrity of the country in a
                    political sense have always come from places such as Aceh, which has a durable
                    separatist movement.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: Northern Sumatra. And in a smaller way in Irian although that's now
                    progressed thanks to the Indonesian military's heavy hand there. When I started
                    traveling in Sulawesi, even in '98, even during Suharto's “new order,” as you
                    talked to people who were co-opted into the system you could always detect the
                    difference in the way they viewed the country as opposed to Javanese. But as you
                    got further and further into the deterioration, and especially after it, you got
                    more overt expression from people in Sulawesi. I think this has always been the
                    case, but they were far more open about the need for northern Sulawesi in the
                    most perfect of worlds, to become independent. Independence was their
                    hypothetical perfect; they had no pretensions of that, but they would begin to
                    express political initiatives about trying to decentralize the country. This was
                    not a question before Suharto fell, but as he fell and afterwards, it was from
                    these people, I think, that came the awareness that decentralization was not a
                    priority years down the road; it would become a critical issue more quickly. It
                    came specifically from Sulawesi first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sulawesi is where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Sulawesi is the crab-like island, Celebes is the old Dutch word,
                    immediately to the north of Java, to the east of Kalimantan, Borneo. It's a
                    rather large island and it's extremely populated, especially South Sulawesi
                    which is the home of the Bugis people who are one of the most significant ethnic
                    groups in the country. They do a lot of roaming, traveling; you find them
                    everywhere. It's a major rice producer; further north in Sulawesi. It has been a
                    major source of extracted resources, but I don't think it economically has all
                    the potential there as it used to. Sulawesi has its own very separate, and also
                    quite diverse, sense of tradition, of history, of governance, that is quite
                    contrary in many ways to the tiered sort of societal stability, layered social
                    caste system with an unquestionable loyalty to the one on top that the Javanese
                    seem to be most comfortable with.</p>
                <p>Once you've been in Java you can appreciate the cultural habits of both. I enjoy
                    those Javanese people who are very, very oblique in the way they talk; and it's
                    quite an eye-opener when you come to Sulawesi and you find out that not everyone
                    talks obliquely. They especially don't, but it is also the case in Sumatra. It's
                    right to the point; so there's just a great difference. So the pull for
                    decentralization became far more prominent more quickly. I think it was
                    primarily from Sulawesi remarks first that it became evident to us that it was
                    not going to go away, that it was an issue. And then of course it's taken on a
                    life of its own as the government began to try to wrestle with it, being fully
                    aware of the fact that decentralization had to be a success for the integrity of
                    the country. The form of it is the other issuwhether it's really going to happen
                    or not in a meaningful way.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: We had few. We had an occasional American citizen issue that had to be
                    solved. I'm not aware of any that were starkly difficult. The major problem that
                    consular operations had in Surabaya was visa applicationour rates of turn-down,
                    our rates of refusal, and as the economy deteriorated and the politics
                    deteriorated, the ballooning applications that would sometimes stretch us to the
                    maximum with little hope for seeing a decline in applications. These were all
                    visitor visatourist visa applicationwe processed no immigrant visas, the
                    criteria for issuing visas becomes a murkier problem. With a tourist visa you're
                    going to enjoy the United States for a limited time and you're not going to
                    work, and of course you have the money and the ability to come and spend and
                    then return to your home country. And suddenly things get bad and you are
                    spending all your time dealing with local Sino-Indonesians who from had been the

                <p>PIERCE: It's a constant barrage, but the thing here is you've got, especially
                    amongst the Sino-Indonesian community, the Indonesian Chinese community, some
                    extremely wealthy individuals who have countless tens of hundreds of millions of
                    dollars in infrastructure invested in the country and continue to do just fine.
                    You rarely have a major problem with these people and their putting their
                    children into the best universities in America. It's more a problem when you
                    have small shopkeepers who have just seen their inventory burned out and now
                    think it's time to go visit Disney World. That's the problem area and that's
                    where you had the major issues.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: That's when I did retire, but was asked to come back in early 2000 for a
                    five or six month stay in Medawhich I had never been tin Sumatra to sort put an
                    American presence in Medan. Although we did not have an official office there,
                    we had had a consulate there, which as you might recall was closed. We had sold
                    the premises that the building was on. We still owned the old consul general's
                    residence and had operated a makeshift presence there staffed permanently by a
                    Foreign Service National. The Department and the embassy wanted to see someone
                    American there in anticipation ultimately for us to restore an office, although
                    this was not an official office, but simply a TDY assignment. The other issue
                    that was specifically a priority for the embassy and the Department was to keep
                    a closer watch on the province of Aceh and the separatist movement there.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: No. When the consulate was there officially, and I think it was closed in

                <p>PIERCE: No. And it was closed from the last exercise wrongfully, I think. We had
                    been determined to restore our presence. Ambassador Roy had been fighting for it
                    before he'd come, and had received the go-ahead for trying to pursue that. I
                    think the logistics of it is the problem of trying to find the appropriate
                    office space. This is beyond my knowledge; this is more an FBO/ADMIN issue. We
                    had kept people up there for long periods of time, in the gap, when there was no
                    American, looking at Aceh. We've made no secret of our concern over the placand
                    the major American presence there of course being the Mobil facility. Even when
                    we had no American in Medan, we had TDYers from Jakarta who would stop in Medan
                    mainly for the economic interests there, and the small American community, but
                    then also go on to Aceh. We've had a very long relationship up there. It's
                    amazing to me when I first got there to find out that in Banda Aceh, the capitol
                    of Aceh, the American alumni club in that most remote, most violence-torn place
                    in the country, has in excess of a hundred members. Long, long cultural and
                    educational ties. Aceh was what we were most interested in and what I focused my
                    attentions on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what was your reading of it? You hadn't been there
                        before. When you got there, what was your reading of what was happening
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Initially you come very fresh to it. I didn't have any acquaintance with
                    Sumatra whatsoever, and knew of Aceh simply from books. This was in the year
                    2000. What had happened is that Aceh, which is rich in natural gas, has been a
                    cash cow for Central Indonesia. Basically what we're talking about is for the
                    last decade, plus, it's been a major source of income. The primary fields near a
                    town called Lhokseumawe spawned a development area all around it utilizing the
                    presence of the natural gas facilities. Then as well it is an exporter of
                    natural gas.</p>
                <p>Aceh has a very checkered history; they never really officially surrendered to
                    the Dutch. I think it was a forty year war before the Dutch declared that Aceh
                    was part of the Indies. It was a bloody time. It was I think the only place the
                    Dutch ever lost generals. They are very good fighters and they have a very
                    fierce streak of independence. They joined the country in the revolution against
                    the Dutch but became quickly disillusioned. I don't want to go into Aceh's
                    history, but they always sensed that they were deprived of their rightful place
                    as a nation; a significant portion of them have that feeling. That said, another
                    significant portion have strong ties to the concept of Indonesia.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>The use of their natural resources by the central government, the obvious fact
                    that the return in revenues was far less than what was extracted, and that most
                    Acehnese live in borderline survival poverty all created conditions which
                    spawned separatism. Most Acehnesthis was in '7did not give a damn for the
                    separatists, but they were successful enough over the years to incur the wrath
                    of the Indonesian military, to the extent that the Indonesian military in key
                    parts of Aceh reacted too harshly, by far. An unfortunate fact of life is when
                    you have a separatist group and you have a military from the centralized part of
                    the country, they sometimes don't distinguish very well between who is a
                    separatist and who is a common, ordinary person. The victims were innumerable.
                    This started basically in the late '80s, and the human rights violations were
                    atrocious. Through a variety of ill-conceived military principles and inept
                    political maneuvers, the central government, especially since '97, '98, had
                    taken what would be a 5 or 10% support for independence for Aceh amongst
                    Acehnese to the overwhelming majority of people preferring to see Aceh
                    independent. The GAthat's the name of a separatist grouhas been able to ride
                    that wave. And that's where we are today.</p>

                <p>PIERCE: It's always the brief whenever you do reporting of this naturto keep the
                    government apprised of human rights and to articulate our positions on human
                    rights. We had already made them well-known before; our great concern over human
                    rights abuses. It's not as though the military was the unilateral infractor of
                    human rights in Aceh. The GAM is a brutal, heartless, quite bloody organization
                    and it has taken its toll amongst people that it does not consider loyal to its
                    cause of independence. They consider them an impediment to their goals,
                    sell-outs to the central government. The GAM has its fair share of blood on its
                    hands as well. We've taken very strong stands ever since the emergence of
                    extreme human rights abuses primarily by the military in the early '90s. It was
                    egregious.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: When I first started going I did take a plane flighthere's one a day from
                    Medan to Banda Aceh, the capitoand made the usual contacts and tried to broaden
                    my contacts there. There's a road that goes up the northern coast from Medan to
                    Banda Aceh and it was not considered the most secure option. I first traveled
                    that way probably in late April, because I got there in March. It's basically a
                    12-hour trip broken by an overnight in the town of Lhokseumawe which is the
                    major focal point of hostility.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>At the time when I went last year, in Aceh itself there must've been 45 military
                    checkpoints along that main road. Most of them were military armed checkpoints,
                    almost all of them adjacent to police stations on the side of the road. What
                    they would do on those is just look at the traffic as it went through. They
                    would not stop it; rarely they would stop me. I never really engaged in
                    conversation about traveling there with them. The Indonesian government had said
                    that diplomats needed permission to travel to Aceh, as well as other provinces
                    that they considered troublesome. I don't think we ever accepted the conditions
                    for travel in country, so it didn't concern me one way or the other. The
                    military or the police never expressed reservations about my travel.</p>
                <p>As in Java I like to travel on roads. That's where you see things. You don't see
                    things by flying. I'd travel most of the time by road to Banda Aceh; it would
                    take two days up, two days back, and then maybe two or three days overnight in
                    Banda Aceh in a decent hotel. I only got into about two conversations with
                    military or police officials over the wisdom of what I had done. I would always
                    try to talk to military commanders, but by that time most military commanders
                    would insist on bureaucratic clearance in Jakarta before they would meet with
                    me, so I no longer tried that. I talked to police officials in Banda Aceh on
                    every occasion I could. Never got into their policy or my travels; I was
                    perfectly comfortable if they raised the issue with me, but the subject never
                    came up. The only time the subject ever came up was when I strayed away from the
                    area of Lhokseumawe into sites maybe ten miles away in the interior where two
                    communities of villagers had taken shelter, becoming internally displaced
                    persons, in two mosque areas, and I went to see them. Unfortunately that got
                    into the local press and the police reacted somewhat sensitively to my failure
                    to coordinate my going to this place. I think they were stunned more by the
                    press play than they were about anything else.</p>
                <p>The only other time I ever got cautioned by a policeman was once I was in a
                    wayside restaurant late at night in Lhokseumawe eating supper and a plainclothes
                    policeman stopped, came in, and asked me where I was going, and told me in no
                    uncertain terms that I should not travel outside of Lhokseumawe on the main
                    highways at nighwhich I had no intention of doing. When I first took the road,
                    one or two or three or four of these road-blocked police military checkpoints
                    would be bombed by the GAM on a daily basis. Firefights would ensue and
                    sometimes one, two, three, four, five people would die. It was always targeted
                    at the military or at the police, at the checkpoint, and pursuit would occur.
                    These incidents mainly lasted perhaps a half an hour. Most of these GAM attacks
                    would take place and you'd presume that the perpetrators, a limited number,
                    would have motor bikes and would sneak away into the interior through the small
                    infrastructural roads, through the rice paddies, within minutes after making
                    their hit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have contact with the leaders of GAM? Alright
                        we're having a significant pause here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: (laughs) Well, let's just say I talked to a lot of strata in Acehnese
                    society.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression by the time you left there of
                        what was going to happen? Was this going to be a subliminaor maybe not
                        subliminal, but an actuawar that would go on forever or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIERCE: Let me tell you the first thing which happens over and over again, and
                    one of the most important things I did. The first thing, obviously, was to find
                    out what was going on in a more detailed way, which I did do. The dynamic of the
                    situation had changed as GAM increased its hold on the villages outside the
                    major cities, and there was a truce at the time which decreased in part some of
                    the hostilities. The second thing, which was the most important thing in my
                    view, was to continually iterate U.S. support for the integrity of Indonesia and
                    our opposition, for lack of a better woryou don't say it quite that starkly in
                    Indonesiato an independent Aceh. Then of course you get into the need for
                    dialogue and peaceful resolution in some way where Acehnese can express their
                    aspirations within the structure of the country of Indonesia, and get more of
                    the economic largess that is coming out of that province.</p>
                <p>I don't think the situation is going to change much. Mr. Abdurrahman Wahid, Gus
                    Dur, was a positive selection as president of the country and tried to address
                    the issue. The problem is that the GAM insists on independence and a significant
                    portion now of Acehnese people support that idea, at least in principle. It's
                    very hard for them to back away from that idea. The Indonesian government has on
                    paper admitted that it needs to give the people of Aceh more of a share of the
                    natural resources and more control over their local affairs. Yet finding a
                    concrete way of letting that occur, especially on the economic side, is not easy
                    in a country which needs as much revenue as this one does simply to finance its
                    economic problems. So you have a standoff and you have no real movement to
                    narrow the thought processes between one side and the other. In the interim what
                    you have is the increasing bloodier and bloodier conflagration in which
                    primarily neutral people are snuffed out in an oftentimes haphazardly way and
                    the violence persists.</p>
                <p>Now, as you might know, the natural gas fields are no longer operating. The
                    Mobil/Exxon people pulled out in late March or early April because of security
                    concerns. It is in the heart of the activity of separatists. You have an
                    Indonesian government committed to reopening those fields but facing severe
                    difficulty in doing so. You have a dialogue between the GAM and the Indonesian
                    government, which started when I was there last year, which has been on-again,
                    off-again, producing little but at least opening the possibility that these
                    people can talk to each other. That's about all. Future prospects? Normally in
                    Indonesia you have inertia producing status quo. You may have a collapse of
                    government or local government responsibility. You may have events that continue
                    to spiral off into turmoil in Maluku. The country is large enough that it will
                    lumber on even as the central government is paralyzed, or at least close to it,
                    with President Wahid now in constant crisis with the parliament.</p>
