                <p>Interviewed by: Jewell Fenzi</p>
                <p>Interview date: May 7, 1998</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Jewell Fenzi on May 7, 1998. I am interviewing
                        Sally Cutler for the AAFSW Oral History collection. We are recording this
                        session at the Woman's National Democratic Club in Washington, DC. Sally,
                        before we begin I would like to put on tape a coincidence that could only
                        occur in the Foreign Service. Thirty-three years ago when we were in
                        Freetown, your sister Jane and her then-husband John were at the British
                        High Commission, and your father was the regional medical officer for Sierra
                        Leone, and probably all of West Africa. If I remember, he was stationed in
                        Lagos. Well, both Jane and your father played significant roles in our
                        lives. We spent endless hours at the bridge table with Jane and John — in
                        West Africa I considered that mental health therapy! — and your father took
                        care of any physical ills, which fortunately were few and not serious. Then
                        we met for the first time in 1997, and a few months ago we were chatting
                        over lunch, and something you said made me suddenly realize that you were
                        Jane's sister and that I had known your family many years ago in another
                        time and another world. And now here we are embarking on a new friendship,
                        but one with old ties for me. Let's start from the beginning, Cameroon, your
                        first post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes, we went to Yaounde in 1957.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you had just been married — married in March and off
                        to West Africa in June. You must have been in the first [Foreign Service]
                        group to Yaounde.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Actually, I was the first of the first group to arrive in Yaounde. Walt
                    and I sailed on the “United States” from New York to Le Havre, and then flew on
                    a prop plane across the Sahara to what was then Leopoldville in the Belgian
                    Congo, now Zaire. The trip across the Sahara seemed to last forever! It gave a
                    real sense of distance traveled, which you don't get with jets. Leopoldville was
                    the supervisory post for Yaounde, which was just being opened, and Walt stayed
                    there for a couple of days to get briefed. So I went on ahead, alone, to
                    Yaounde, where I was met by a little group of Presbyterian missionaries. They
                    were amazed to see someone in stockings! Of course, in those days we always
                    traveled in stockings and girdles and wore hats and gloves. Imagine!</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>An interesting footnote. Walt stayed in the consul general's residence while he
                    was in Leopoldville. That was where he spent his very first night in Africa.
                    Sixteen years later, he returned as ambassador to live in that same house. By
                    chance, I had learned something about sub-Saharan Africa in a course I took my
                    last year at Smith called “Africa South of the Sahara,” which was taught by
                    Professor Gwendolen Carter. She will appear again later. But I never guessed
                    that less than a year later, I would find myself living there. Another
                    coincidence, but Foreign Service life is filled with coincidences.</p>
                <p>Actually, my journey to Africa began with my father's decision while I was a
                    senior in college to sell his medical practice in Wooster, Ohio, and join the
                    Foreign Service as a medical officer. What got him started was John Gunther's
                    Inside Africa. When he phoned me at Smith to announce his decision, I was so
                    naive, or maybe so provincial, that I thought he was talking about the Foreign
                    Legion and I said something like, “We'll talk about this when I get home.” By
                    the time I got home, he had sold his practice and was on his way to Washington
                    with my mother and sister. I tagged along and took a job as a secretary in the
                    State Department, thinking, I suppose, that I would move on to something more
                    interesting later, marriage being my first choice.</p>
                <p>One day, a friend of mine from Ohio walked into my office with Walt Cutler, and
                    six months later we were married. By then, my sister and my parents were in
                    Manila and they didn't come back for our wedding in Philadelphia, which I'd
                    chosen because my parents had been married there in the same church. They and
                    Walt didn't meet until we left the Cameroon in 1959. We joined them in Rome,
                    where they were on their way to Karachi. We were on our way back to Washington.
                    We got to Rome very early in the morning and went back to the pensione with my
                    family. It was too early to find breakfast, so my father said, “Let's have a
                    drink!” So right there, at dawn, we had scotch and warm tap water, and Walt must
                    have thought we were a very dissolute bunch!</p>
                <p>My father and mother spent sixteen years in the Foreign Service, much of it in
                    Africa, which would figure so prominently in our own lives and that of my sister
                    who served with her British diplomat husband in Nairobi and Freetown. We saw a
                    lot of the missionaries in Yaounde, and I never much approved of what they were
                    doing. It seemed to me that they didn't have a right to impose their own beliefs
                    and practices on Africans who had their own ways of doing and thinking, and I
                    still feel that way.</p>
                <p>Some Africans went along with them for reasons having nothing to do with
                    religion. One was that they made a connection between driving a Lincoln and
                    being a Christian because all the missionaries came to Cameroon with big
                    American cars given to them by their parishes in Indiana and Iowa. I think the
                    Africans thought, well, if I go to this church, I will get a Lincoln! Of course,
                    that's not what happened, and I don't think many lasting conversions were
                    made.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>But the missionaries were kind and generous. We had very little else in the way
                    of an American community there. There was a man with Shell, who had an American
                    wife, and there was an American couple with Mobil Oil. To the best of my
                    recollection, those were the only other Americans in town besides the consulate
                    group which consisted of Bob and Marjorie Foulon, Walt and me, and an
                    administrative couple, Tom and Doris James.</p>
                <p>Oh, yes, there was an animal trapper named Phil Carroll, who had been a battery
                    salesman in St. Louis. He had a miserable little house out on the fringes of
                    Yaounde, which was full of animals he was sending back to the States, either to
                    zoos or for medical research. Now this was years before I became aware of this
                    problem. He had a house full of baby gorillas. These are the lowland gorillas
                    that are now an endangered species. He'd have as many as eight or ten of them at
                    a time. Someone had knitted red sweaters for them. You'd go out there and here'd
                    be these baby gorillas running around loose in the house in little red, pullover
                    sweaters. It was quite enchanting.</p>
                <p>I remember one night going out with him, late at night, in the middle of the
                    night, to pick up a baby elephant whose mother had been killed. Someone had told
                    Phil Carroll about the baby elephant. It was an extraordinary experience because
                    I never again, I think, drove all night through African villages. It's quite
                    eerily quiet and dark.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dark.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: There is not a light anywhere. We went on and on and on. We eventually
                    found the elephant, put it in the truck, and brought it back. I do remember
                    feeling that this is the darkest, quietest night I'd ever known. It was quite an
                    experience. There was nothing much for me to do there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask you ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: There was ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... how did you fill your day?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: ... nothing for me to do. Now, had I been an artist or a creative writer,
                    or had some kind of hobby that one pursues in solitude, that I could have done.
                    But unfortunately, I didn't have any of those talents. I read. I wrote many
                    letters, lots of letters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lots to write about.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>CUTLER: I had lots to write about because my life was so unusual. But basically,
                    I just kept house and traveled when I could with Walt. I also traveled with Dr.
                    Gwendolen Carter from Smith, who came out on a Ford Foundation grant — I think
                    it was in '58 — to study the political systems in the West African countries
                    verging on independence. The person with whom she was traveling, who was her
                    secretary and companion because she, Dr. Carter, was a polio victim, got sick in
                    Douala. So Gwen Carter asked me whether I would go the rest of the way with her,
                    and I had a fascinating two-month trip with her up the west coast of Africa,
                    spending a great deal of time in Nigeria, all over Nigeria, and then going on to
                    Ghana and Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Senegal. Then I returned to
                    Cameroon, and she went home.</p>
                <p>It was a very interesting trip because her contacts were important. We were
                    housed by the British High Commissioner [Sir Ralph Grey] in his palatial
                    residence in Lagos for the time that we were there. All the chiefs in Kaduna and
                    Kano and so on came out in full regalia to greet her. She met with the
                    university professors. I went along as part of the party. So that was a
                    wonderful opportunity for me to see and learn a little bit more of Africa.</p>
                <p>One funny story about that trip. When we stayed at Government House in Lagos, we
                    had to dress for dinner every night. Well, I hadn't taken any evening clothes
                    with me, so I had to buy something in Lagos, at a Kingsway store, I think. The
                    pickings were slim, to say the least. I finally found a dress, but it was
                    slightly small and strapless and I hadn't brought a strapless bra. So I had to
                    wear it bra-less. After dinner we'd toast the Queen by raising a glass high with
                    the right arm and shouting in unison, “To the Queen! God bless her!” Every time
                    I raised my arm I could just imagine the zipper on that dress giving out and me
                    standing there practically nude with my dress around my ankles!</p>
                <p>It needs to be said that in those days, and still today, I think, relatively,
                    Foreign Service officers were not very well paid. I think Walt was making
                    forty-four, maybe forty-two hundred dollars a year when we joined the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: And while at that time it was certainly adequate to live on, we didn't
                    have a lot of surplus cash to take wonderful trips in Africa. We couldn't just
                    wing off to South Africa or over to Kenya or whatever, you know, for a holiday
                    because the money wasn't there. That's too bad as I look back on it because we
                    were there during interesting times, and I wish that we had been able to see
                    more of the continent than we did.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Of course, the big thing was ordering food and liquor from Ostermann Peterson and
                    Peter Justesen in Denmark. You'd make out vast orders, and then you'd wait weeks
                    and weeks and then suddenly, the boat would come in and this stuff would arrive
                    at your door, and it was like Christmas! There were all the things that you'd
                    just been thinking about that you couldn't buy locally, like ketchup and peanut
                    butter. Of course, I shopped locally. There were no supermarkets, and there was
                    no PX. You had the same thing in Sierra Leone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was just the market.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: You went to the butcher for the meat, and you went to the vegetable
                    market, and you went to the bakery and so forth and so on, and that took up part
                    of the day. You played bridge. If I had my life to live over, I would come
                    equipped with some sort of solo talent to see me through lean times. I guess at
                    the time it didn't seem unbearable, but it was. The days were long.</p>
                <p>Housekeeping took a lot of time and energy. We had a two-burner hot plate
                    connected to a bottle of gas for cooking and a kerosene refrigerator, which
                    probably very few people today have ever seen. There was no hot water in the
                    kitchen, so if I needed hot water, I had to get it in the bathroom. I used to
                    iron in our guest house. It had a large jasmine vine on the roof, which the
                    African killer bees loved. One day when I was out there, the bees began
                    attacking me. I guess the queen was doing her mating dance.</p>
                <p>We had another incident with the bees. We woke up one morning and heard loud
                    buzzing in the living room. Walt put some mosquito netting over his head and
                    went out to see what was going on. Well, the house was filled with angry bees.
                    Outdoors, where we'd been keeping some chickens for friends who had gone off on
                    vacation, he found that the bees had stung all the chickens to death. The
                    gardener was so badly stung that we had to take him off to the hospital.</p>
                <p>We regularly found snakes in the laundry basket and elsewhere. One even crawled
                    across the floor of the living room one night when we were having dinner. You
                    had to be very careful where you put your hands.</p>
                <p>One day when we were expecting guests for dinner, I went into the bathroom, where
                    there was hot water, to polish silver. I picked up a box of soap and behind it,
                    coiled up, was a snake. So I put on my shoes and walked down to the road, where
                    two African men were changing the tire on a Deux Chevaux. I politely asked if
                    they would come and take care of the snake, and they did. Months later, Walt
                    went to a reception given by the French High Commissioner, and one of the guests
                    walked up to him and said, “I've been in your bathroom — with your wife!” It
                    turned out that he was the newly elected Minister of Youth and Sports, and I
                    guess my snake was, in a way, a sporting event!</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I had poor help and no cook. Our first houseboy was a Nigerian named Archibald.
                    He was literate, and this was his undoing because he read Time magazine while I
                    did his work. One morning he came to me with his hands behind his back, and he
                    said, “I'd like to discuss the Syrian question with you, Mrs.” Well, I didn't
                    even know there was a Syrian question! I did know that while he was informing
                    himself about Syria, I was out in the guest house ironing while the bees were
                    attacking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: So I said to Walt that night, “For my birthday, I'm firing
                    Archibald.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I had never fired a servant in my life, and this was traumatic for me,
                    but I did it. I was just worried to death. I guess I thought he might starve.
                    Well, Archibald found another job in no time at all, and he was fine. His
                    replacement was named Michel. He was somewhat more diligent about the housework,
                    but he had an attitude. Finally. towards the end of our tour, I came home one
                    morning from the market and nothing had been done in the house. It was as though
                    he had not been there. So I said, “Michel, what have you been up to this
                    morning?” And he said, in a surly tone of voice, “J'ai dormi, j'ai fais pee
                    pee.” [I slept, I have make pee pee.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: And I said, “That's it! You're gone!” Well, he had a bicycle, and I had a
                    Ford. I knew he was going to go straight to the consulate and appeal to Walt for
                    redress, so we raced, he and I, to the consulate. I passed him on his bicycle,
                    and I raced into to Walt's office, and I said, “Walt, you have about three
                    minutes to make a choice here.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] ... between me and Michel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: “It's either me or Michel! Now, I know this is a hard choice to make,” I
                    said, “but this is it!” I thought what would probably happen was that Michel
                    would get in there and the two of them would agree that I was a difficult person
                    to live with, but I'd get over it and not to worry. Well, Walt came down on my
                    side, so Michel went. However, I had to hire him back because I couldn't find
                    anybody any better than he.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no! [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>CUTLER: So, of course, when he came back, he was worse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Worse than ever. Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: He went on to become houseboy to Marilyn and Allen Holmes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: We lent him one night for a dinner party at the consul's house where all
                    of the people who were anybody in Yaounde — and believe me all of the people who
                    were anybody in Yaounde weren't much — were invited for dinner. Michel was to
                    handle the wine. Well, I couldn't believe it. I looked around and here he was,
                    dapper in his white jacket with pockets in it. In his left pocket, he had a
                    bottle of red wine. In his right pocket, he had a bottle of white wine.
                    [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: He would sidle up to a guest at the table and sort of do a hip check and
                    point at his pockets and say, “Vin rouge? Vin blanc?” Everyone in the room was
                    looking at me as if to say, “Do you really suppose this is the way these
                    Americans do things?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: If we had grapefruit halves for the first course and everyone was
                    finished, he'd remove the grapefruit rinds, leaving the plates, stack them up
                    nesting-style, and carry them in a leaning tower out to the kitchen. He never
                    did these things when it was just the two of us, but there was something about a
                    dinner party that stirred his creative impulse. He always did these things when
                    we had guests.</p>
                <p>While I was traveling with Gwen Carter, our two goldfish died. Worried, I guess,
                    that Walt would think he'd eaten them, Michel put the two corpses in a glass of
                    water and set it down in front of Walt at lunch! So he was quite a character. He
                    stayed on with the Holmeses, and I know she has stories to tell about him,
                    too.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I remember the airport in Yaounde. They had a little landing strip. It was a dirt
                    landing strip. When the plane landed after dark, all the people in town would be
                    asked to drive out to the airport and face their cars in a circle around the
                    landing strip, leaving, of course, one end open, or both ends, I guess, for the
                    plane to fly into and out of. That's how they illuminated the airstrip at night,
                    with the headlights from automobiles. This was extraordinarily primitive living
                    for anybody like us, even in 1957.</p>
                <p>We were there during the time when they were having real difficulties with a
                    group called the UPC, which was a rebel group with some Communist backing that
                    wanted to form the first government of Cameroon after independence. They began
                    to commit some pretty heinous atrocities on Europeans, much like the Mau Mau in
                    Kenya. One thing they did was they went into the movie theater in Douala one
                    evening and macheted everybody in the back row. So the government ordered a
                    curfew. No one could be out of the house after nine o'clock at night. If you
                    were, they — the Cameroonian police and so on — had orders to shoot first and
                    ask questions later, so people were pretty careful about going out at night.</p>
                <p>One night about eleven o'clock, we were in bed. Now remember, this is a
                    ground-floor house which was wide open to the world. No screens. No telephone.
                    No house on any side of us. We had fields on either side of us, and no other
                    houses in the back or the front that you could see. Our dog barked. She never
                    barked at night. So Walt got up and went out and shook the sleeping sentinel
                    awake. He slept well at night! He had a large spear to defend us with. The
                    sentinel prowled around for a while and came back and said that there were two
                    men going along the perimeter of our property next to our bedroom window. Well,
                    Walt had said to me, shortly before that, that if the rebel group really wanted
                    to get some attention around the world, a wonderful way to do it would be to
                    murder somebody from the American consulate. So, of course, immediately those
                    words came to my mind. We had no way of summoning help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not even a radio?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nothing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>CUTLER: We had no radio. We had no telephone. We had nothing! Walt had a pistol,
                    which he'd been told to keep — and he's not a marksman — with six bullets in it.
                    So he went to the window and shot into the air three times, and we waited and
                    waited. It seemed like forever. By now I am seeing the headlines in the New York
                    Times. By now, it's all over. You know, “American Vice Consul and Wife Brutally
                    Murdered in Yaounde, Cameroon.” It would send everybody looking for their
                    atlases! Then he fired again. All of a sudden, the police and the military and
                    so forth arrived and nobody was found. But that was as close as I feel I ever
                    came to being involved in some sort of really awful incident, though in Algeria
                    we were there when Ben Bella was overthrown, and all that occurred right in our
                    neighborhood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you living behind bars? Did you have security bars
                        [in Cameroon]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: On the windows. But we had louvered wooden doors, double doors. Well, you
                    know, anybody can ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Walk right though them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Oh, yes. There were no grills on them. Anybody could just yank on one of
                    those and pull them right off. So we were really very insecure. But I think we
                    were so young and weren't smart enough to know that it was a problem. At that
                    age you don't think you're going to die anyhow. I did that night. I mean, I
                    really did. I thought this ... this is it.</p>
                <p>At last, our two years were up. I could not wait to leave. I was just at the end
                    of my rope. I'd had it. We heard that Allen Holmes was going to replace us
                    there, and then we heard that Allen wanted to get married and would we please
                    stay on another three months so that he could have the wedding and the honeymoon
                    and so on. Well, what can you say? Of course, yes, we said we would.</p>
                <p>Finally, the day came when they arrived, and I remember them getting off the
                    plane. I had met Allen at Princeton some years before that, so he was familiar
                    to me. Marilyn, of course, I hadn't known. Allen got off the plane, and he
                    tossed me his raincoat, and I almost fell to the ground. He had his pockets
                    filled with every heavy thing that he owned, so that he could get it on the
                    plane without having to weigh it in. I remember that. Marilyn, who would
                    subsequently become and remains a close friend of mine, was just euphoric. She
                    was a bride. She'd married the man of her dreams. She was going to do wonderful
                    things in Yaounde, all sorts of fabulous projects. She had plans. She was just
                    floating, and I was absolutely at my wits' end. I remember sitting in the living
                    room, listening to all of this and sinking lower and lower in my chair and my
                    eyes glazing over and thinking, “Oh, where does all of this come from?”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Of course, I didn't tell her that what lay ahead might not measure up to
                    her expectations because there's no point in being negative at a time like that.
                    So we had three or four pleasant enough days together, and we left.</p>
                <p>I'd say about four months after we got back to Washington, I got a letter from
                    Marilyn, and it started out sort of like this: “Dear Sally, Only twenty-two
                    months, five days, seven hours, and nineteen minutes until our time is up. I can
                    hardly wait!” And I thought, “Thank God! There's not something wrong with me!”
                    You know, at least she now sees what I saw.</p>
                <p>Our departure from Africa took us through Fort Lamy, in what was then Chad, which
                    was the jumping-off point to Europe. We went into the airport, which was quite,
                    in my memory, quite large. I'm sure it wasn't large, but it looked large to
                    somebody who'd been two years in Yaounde. They had a dining room and bar behind
                    glass doors, and we went in there and sat down. There were ventilation holes all
                    around the edges of the ceilings, which is typical of African architecture. And
                    there were ceiling fans.</p>
                <p>I was looking at the ceiling and I noticed a bird flying up there. Walt, in the
                    meantime, had stepped out to buy stamps because he was a stamp collector. When
                    he came back again, I said, “Walt, look at that poor little bird flying around
                    up there. It's going to come into contact with the ceiling fan, and that will be
                    the end of the bird.” Walt said, “That's not a bird. It's a bat. But don't
                    worry. They have good radar systems. They won't collide with the fans.” Well, he
                    had no sooner said that than the room grew dark with bats. They swarmed in
                    through those ventilation holes in droves to get the mosquitoes which were
                    everywhere, and there were so many of them that their radar couldn't handle the
                    fans and the next thing I knew, it was raining bats in that room!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Dead bats. Stunned bats. Comatose bats. Bleeding bats. screeching bats.
                    The African waiters in the room were rushing around with little whisk brooms and
                    dust pans, sweeping the bodies up as fast as they could. The woman behind the
                    bar was pouring drinks as though nothing were going on. I literally thought I
                    had died and gone to hell because I can face almost anything, but bats do me in!
                    I had on a pair of stockings — it was the last pair I owned in the world — and
                    we were on our way to Rome to meet my family. I slid under the table, got down
                    on my hands and knees, and I literally crawled on all fours out of that room,
                    which was big, and through the glass doors and into the other part of the
                    airport where the bats weren't.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>I think I had said something to Walt as we took off from Yaounde, something like,
                    “Well, you know, this really hasn't been so bad. I suppose I wouldn't mind
                    coming back to Africa some day.” By the time we got on the plane to go to Rome,
                    I said, “Walt, I take that back. That was a careless statement that I made, and,
                    under these circumstances, I'm retracting it. I don't ever want to go back to
                    Africa!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, of course, I did go back to Africa. But it was certainly a fine
                    farewell. Flying in Africa was always an adventure. I remember flying to Garoua
                    one time, on my way to somewhere, in a great big Air France plane. Everybody on
                    the plane got off and sat in the airport dining room where a French couple
                    served lunch. You took whatever they had, and it was delicious. When we took off
                    from the airport, the plane suddenly made a dramatic turn, came back over the
                    restaurant, dipped one wing so close to the ground I thought we were going to
                    touch the ground with the wing, and then flew away. I learned later that Air
                    France pilots did that to say thank you if they'd liked the lunch. So with an
                    airplane full of passengers, they did this aerial maneuver to say thank you to
                    the French couple in the airport at Garoua. Well, that was, it was always sort
                    of an adventure.</p>
                <p>Africa was in ferment then. All these countries, one after the next, were
                    becoming independent, and there was a lot of maneuvering about who was going to
                    constitute the legitimate government and so on. It was an interesting time to be
                    there.</p>
                <p>When we left, there were no packers, so we had to pack up our few household
                    effects and ship them back to the States where we were going next. Recently,
                    when I was reading through Mette Beecroft's transcript and she talks about all
                    of these people helping everybody with packing and making sure that they
                    understand all these kinds of things, oh, I thought she ... You know, we just
                    never had that. We never thought anything about it. I mean, you got the boxes
                    and you filled them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: That was just the way you did it. If you didn't want to pack your things,
                    you left them there. Otherwise, you packed them yourself.</p>
                <p>I must say we've kept in touch with Bob Foulon [the first consul in Yaounde]
                    since — I still see him from time to time — because in those small communities
                    you become very close very fast to the people who are sharing that experience
                    with you. Nobody else is ever going to understand. We've all had that
                    experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>We came home from Yaounde and went to visit Walt's family in Kennebunk, Maine.
                    You get the question, “How was it?” And you only start to say how it was when
                    suddenly you find you're talking about the local sewer commission or some piece
                    of local business. It isn't that they're not interested. It's that it is so
                    foreign to them, and I don't mean just geographically. The experience is so
                    foreign that they have no way of relating to it, which, I think, is one reason
                    that Foreign Service families tend to be so groupie because only someone who has
                    been there, particularly in those earlier days, is going to know what you're
                    talking about and understand what the experience was like. So you make close
                    friends, and you see them often and keep up with them.</p>
                <p>From there we came back to Washington, and Walt was assigned to night shift duty
                    in the State Department where they read the incoming cable traffic and prepare a
                    summary for the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Operations Center.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: After a while, when Rusk came in as Secretary of State with the Kennedy
                    election, Walt went to work as one of the assistants in his office. He was
                    working for Secretary Rusk during the Bay of Pigs invasion which, of course, I
                    knew nothing about because Walt was very close-lipped. Someone once said, “Walt
                    will tell you anything you can read in the New York Times.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Actually, that was my choice because I felt that not knowing was security
                    for me. In other words, if I had known, then I might inadvertently have said
                    something to someone in a situation where nothing should have been said. So I
                    always said to him, “If this is something that needs to be kept secret, don't
                    tell me.” You just never know. Somebody could ...</p>
                <p>We had three years in Washington then, and most of it he spent in Rusk's office.
                    Then, towards the end of 1962, we knew we were about to go out again. At that
                    time, they were tossing trucks full of boiling oil into the Casbah in Algiers,
                    and I said to Walt, “Look, I'll go anywhere except Algeria. That's the last
                    place I want to go.” Well, guess what?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>CUTLER: He came home one night, and he said, “We're going to Algiers.” By this
                    time, we'd had our first child. Allen was born in Washington. He was about ...
                    he was born in '61, so he was two. Walt went out ahead of me to Algiers, and I
                    stayed two months with my mother and father who, by that time, were living in an
                    apartment in Washington between assignments. I was with them during the Cuban
                    missile crisis, so we left for Algiers on top of the Cuban missile crisis.</p>
                <p>We got to Algiers in '62, and, as was the case at every post we had in the
                    Foreign Service, we moved within post. The first place we stayed was not the
                    last place we were in. We always moved within post. We eventually moved into a
                    rather nice, quite modern house in an area called Park Paradou. At that time,
                    Ben Bella was president.</p>
                <p>One night not long after we got there and moved into Park Paradou we had a dinner
                    party. We had some Turkish friends there that night. They stayed on after
                    everyone left and we sat around talking about the coups d'�tat in Vietnam that
                    were going on at that point. They went home and not long after there were huge
                    bursts of gunfire all around us and tanks started rolling down the street and
                    armored vehicles in front of our house. I remember Walt sent me into the hallway
                    upstairs with Allen and told us to get down on our stomachs on the floor. He, of
                    course, went to the window and opened it wide to see what was going on, which I
                    thought was foolhardy, but he did it. It turned out that that was the time that
                    Ben Bella was overthrown. The people they were after were members of his
                    government who lived in Park Paradou. However, the Turkish couple lived next
                    door to Ben Bella, so Walt called Dinch on the phone and said, “What's going
                    on?” Of course, they couldn't speak freely, and Dinch said, “I don't know
                    whether we have new neighbors or not.”</p>
                <p>After that, things closed down in Algiers. We were restricted in our travel. We
                    were not allowed to go thirty kilometers outside of town without permission from
                    the foreign ministry and so we kept pretty close to home in Algiers. We had to
                    submit our guest lists to the Foreign Ministry for approval.</p>
                <p>We had a funny experience when we moved into this house. Our phone didn't work,
                    so I went down to the telephone company and said, “Our phone doesn't work.” They
                    said, “We know that. You haven't paid your bill.” I said, “Well, we've never
                    received a bill.” And they said, “We know. We've never sent them out.” I had
                    nothing more to say.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Our phone didn't work because I hadn't paid the bill we'd never received
                    because they'd never sent it. Those are the kinds of things that happen in the
                    Foreign Service.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: They make it kind of fun. I want to go back because I'm looking at my own
                    notes here. People talk about culture shock in the Foreign Service. I don't
                    think I ever experienced it except once, when we came back from Cameroon. I'd
                    never kept house until we went to Cameroon, so that is where I learned to buy
                    meat and vegetables and bread and so on. We came back here, and I went to that
                    Safeway on Wisconsin Avenue. I guess they call it the Social Safeway, or
                    whatever. I was blown away. I went up to the meat counter, and there was this
                    endless counter with cuts of meat I had never bought in my life, all wrapped in
                    plastic. There was no human being anywhere to talk to. I remember thinking,
                    really thinking to myself, we are going to starve to death because I don't know
                    how to buy food here.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: That was my cultural shock. Now back to Algeria. I took a wonderful trip
                    in Algeria. There was an NGO group out there — a non-governmental ... whatever
                    they're called.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: An organization like CARE. I can't remember the name of the group now. It
                    was small and not terribly well known. Three of them and I took a two-week trip
                    through the Sahara Desert to see the Tassili cave paintings in the Hoggar
                    Mountains. That was truly a breathtaking experience in every way. It was really
                    a trek. We went with six donkeys and a Tuareg and a Sudanese guide and the four
                    of us. We slept on the rock or the sand at night and walked during the day and
                    saw these fabulous prehistoric paintings on the walls of the enormous rock
                    pinnacles that rise out of the desert. I think people have an idea that desert
                    is all sand. Well, there's not very much sand. There's a great deal of rock,
                    which, over the millennia, has been hollowed out by the wind and the sand
                    blowing against them, so that at the bases of these huge, skyscraping towers are
                    hollowed-out areas large enough to stand in. That was where these paintings
                    were. They were not in dark caves. You could see them. They really are
                    remarkable.</p>
                <p>It was our great good fortune to just, by chance, get the guide named Djebrin who
                    had led the French expedition that went in in the thirties and rediscovered
                    these paintings after centuries of their not being known to anybody but perhaps
                    a few nomads in the desert. I remember at night the guides would make a fire on
                    the sand, and then Djebrin would put his feet right in the fire to warm them.
                    He'd been bitten by a scorpion or a viper on one of his trips, and he didn't
                    have any sensation in the soles of his feet, so it didn't matter whether his
                    feet were right on the edge of the fire or not. They were like leather anyway
                    because he walked barefoot.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The guides were, of course, Muslim, and at every appointed hour of prayer these
                    two would throw themselves face down on the desert and pray. I remember we said
                    to ourselves, “If you lived in this kind of an environment, you, too, would get
                    down on your knees and pray,” because it is impossible to describe the utter
                    loneliness of that part of the world. It is empty. It is so quiet at night you
                    could be deaf. There is no background noise of traffic or dogs barking or
                    children crying or a radio playing. There is nothing. What you do get is a one
                    hundred and eighty degrees of the most brilliant stars you have ever seen. There
                    is nothing to interfere with the starlight. You lie at night on the desert and
                    you look up and see this glorious sky. It is simply fabulous. It was the most
                    wonderful trip.</p>
                <p>We didn't have a bath for two weeks and we drank water out of goatskin bags, and
                    out of the goatskin bags came goat hair and God knows what other sorts of
                    things. We took all of our food with us. I remember Walt meeting me at the plane
                    when we came back, and he said something about some kind of embassy thing that
                    was going on, some little problem in the embassy. I looked at him and said, “You
                    know, Walt, it seems so trivial.” For quite a while after I got back, things did
                    seem trivial to me. After the enormousness — and I'm saying “enormousness”
                    because “enormity” really is not the right word ... but it was an enormous world
                    that I had been in, and all these petty human concerns just weren't important. I
                    always said it was much better than a long course of psychiatric care. It was
                    just fabulous. I loved that.</p>

                <p>CUTLER: That's right. Bill Porter was the ambassador in Algiers, and John Root
                    was the DCM. Mrs. Porter was quite a character. She had been an army nurse, and
                    she still had something of the WAC in her. Bill Porter was a big, easygoing guy
                    who had been born, I think, in England. He had no formal education beyond
                    secondary school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: He started in the Foreign Service as a clerk and ended up being
                    ambassador to Algeria and I think to ... I know he was somewhere in Asia, in
                    Vietnam. He was ambassador to Seoul. He was ambassador to Canada. So here was a
                    man, who, unlike most of the Foreign Service in those days, did not have an Ivy
                    League background. He had really started from the bottom. He was a most affable
                    and charming man. He was always very nice to me, and I think he kind of liked
                    me. He wrote me one time, years later, when Walt had a promotion, and he said
                    something very nice in the letter like “We both know that he would not have
                    gotten there without you,” which I thought was a nice thing to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very nice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I'm sure that that's not the case, but I thought it was sweet of Porter
                    to say this.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Porter had a thing about hats. Here we are in a Muslim country where Muslim
                    women cover themselves up with chadors, and Mrs. Porter insisted that all of her
                    “girls” wear hats to every embassy function. Well, of course, I had not come to
                    Algiers with a boatload of hats, and I really bristled at this; but, of course,
                    we all managed to find something to put on our heads. Years later, when we went
                    out to Korea to serve again with the Porters, I thought I was terribly smart. I
                    knew something nobody else knew: hats were on the menu. So at some expense, I
                    went down and I bought a selection on hats. I was going to be prepared. I got
                    there and Mrs. Porter had gotten over her hat thing.</p>

                <p>CUTLER: I never wore any of those hats the whole time we were in Korea. And, you
                    know, I had spent money that we really didn't have to spend on headgear I didn't
                    need, and I will never forget it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: In Algiers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, in Algeria. Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: The circumstances of his birth were really unique.</p>
                <p>By way of background, some months before his delivery the airplane at the embassy
                    had overflown Algerian military installations in the Sahara Desert and the
                    Algerians had impounded the plane. Ambassador Porter was desperate to get this
                    plane out of hock. Also, Allen, who was a little over two, had been having
                    repeated ear infections the way little kids frequently do. An American
                    pediatrician had come through Algiers and had looked at Allen and said, “He
                    needs to have a bilateral myringectomy” or whatever it is where they insert
                    little tubes in the eardrums for drainage. This could not be done in
                    Algiers.</p>
                <p>At that time, all of the French medical people had left, and the hospitals were
                    understaffed and under equipped, and it wouldn't have been a safe place to have
                    a baby. My father, who had been an obstetrician, was determined that I was not
                    going to have a baby in Algiers, so I was to go to the military base, the
                    American military base, in Torrejon, Spain. I would take Allen with me where he
                    would get his ears taken care of and then I would stay on and have the baby
                    there. That was the the plan.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Ambassador Porter seized this opportunity to say to the Algerian government that
                    we had a medical emergency in the embassy. We have to evacuate this woman and
                    her “sick” child. We need our plane back. Well, it worked. I don't know why the
                    Algerians were so gullible, but they let him have his plane back.</p>
                <p>I had been told that Thomas was due in November, so the plan had been that I
                    would fly up at the end of September with Allen who would have his ears taken
                    care of. There was only one commercial flight a week. The next week Walt would
                    come up, stay a week to get the next commercial flight back with Allen, and I
                    would remain on alone in Torrejon to have the baby. It was the only way it could
                    be done. Allen and I left about the thirtieth of September. I'm very pregnant,
                    far more pregnant than I knew I was, and Allen is two years and three months
                    old, and off we went. We flew up to Torrejon. I don't know whether you were ever
                    a patient at a military base.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was at Torrejon. At Torrejon. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: You are challenged to present your credentials — in other words,
                    what-in-the-world-are-you-doing-here? kind of thing. So I had loads of documents
                    under my arms saying who I was and why I was there. When we arrived, we were put
                    in the Torrejon “Hilton.” Do you know that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, I can't remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, that is a misnomer. It was a three-story quonset hut, the guest
                    house on the air base. They put us, Allen and me, on the third floor of this
                    walk-up. So here I am vastly pregnant and with this toddler, going up and down
                    the stairs. Allen was due to have his surgery on Wednesday morning, so that gave
                    me two days to fill with him. We spent all the time riding around on a bus on
                    the military base, looking at guns and tanks and all of the things little boys
                    love. Tuesday afternoon, I put him in the pediatric ward to prepare for surgery
                    the following morning.</p>
                <p>While I was sitting there, I began to feel an ominous sensation reminiscent of
                    labor, but I was determined that this couldn't happen. It just couldn't. It was
                    totally impossible for this to happen. Here I had this little child who was
                    going to have surgery the next morning in a place he'd never been and no father
                    around. I just simply had to be there.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Well, my mother and father knew a couple named Copeland, who were with USIA in
                    Madrid. Mother had contacted them prior to my going to Torrejon, telling them
                    what was going on. They made the mistake of calling me that Tuesday afternoon
                    and asking if I'd like to go to the officer's club with them for dinner. I said
                    I would. So I left Allen in the hospital and went out to dinner with the
                    Copelands, whom I had never seen in my life, nor they, me. This was in the bad
                    old days when people drank and smoked during pregnancy because we weren't aware
                    of the fact that this was a deadly thing to do. So I had a drink, maybe I had
                    two drinks, but it was enough for me to say to them, you know, “I hate to bring
                    this up, but I'm a little bit concerned. I think I could be in labor.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I wish I'd had a camera at that point so that I could have recorded their
                    faces when I said that. I explained that Allen was being operated on the
                    following morning, and if, in fact, what I thought was the case, I would need
                    some help. They, of course, good Foreign Service people that they were, said,
                    “Of course, we'll do whatever we can.”</p>
                <p>I went back that night to the “Hilton,” in quotes. I climbed up to my room, and I
                    took a sleeping pill. I thought, “I'm going to ward this thing off. This is not
                    going to happen. I know I'm in labor, but it's just going to have to wait.” My
                    first thought was for my little two-year old. This shows you how damned ignorant
                    we were in those days. I must say, none of this seemed to have had any
                    aftereffects on Thomas.</p>
                <p>About three in the morning, it became obvious that there was no holding this
                    back. So I packed up my suitcase and trotted down to the desk. They had a
                    Spaniard on the desk that night, and I don't speak Spanish, but I'm wearing a
                    bathrobe, and I'm clearly pregnant, and I have my bag, which I left at the desk,
                    saying I'd be back to get it in a few days; so the man at the desk got the idea
                    that I was in labor, and he called an ambulance. Around comes the ambulance
                    driven by an American kid who joined the Air Force to see the world and ended up
                    driving pregnant ladies to the hospital in the middle of night. I hopped into
                    the front seat with him and off we went.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Then, of course, I had to go through all of this paperwork when I got to the
                    hospital. I'm in the full throes of labor at this point, and I'm pulling out
                    passports and birth certificates and travel orders. Finally, they put me
                    directly into a labor room with the Spanish bride of a GI whose first baby this
                    was. She was wide-eyed with fear. Well, of course, that made it incumbent upon
                    me to be the soul of calm reason, though we could not talk to each other. I
                    remember I was reading E.B. White's essays and judiciously keeping very calm
                    right though the labor pains. I think I read the same sentence in this essay
                    thirty-three times. At about six in the morning, they wheeled me into the
                    delivery room. I had no anesthetic. I had never seen the doctor who delivered
                    the baby, whose name happened to be Castro. I remember looking at the clock on
                    the wall in the delivery room and seeing it was 6:31 in the morning — and there
                    was Thomas.</p>
                <p>At eight o'clock that same morning, my dear little two-year old was undergoing
                    surgery, and there was no mother there. He was going to be anesthetized and and
                    taken back afterwards to a place he'd never been before. I just thought, “This
                    is the worst thing that could happen.” They would not let me out of the
                    maternity ward. I was quite ambulatory. I'd had no anesthesia. Peasants in China
                    do this every day: you walk into the rice paddy, stop for a moment, throw the
                    baby on your back, and off you go! They didn't let me go because they were
                    afraid of the danger of infection traveling between the two wards. So what to
                    do?</p>
                <p>I called the Copelands and said, “The worst has happened, and here's the
                    problem.” Of course, they jumped into the breech, and the next day they took
                    Allen home with them to Madrid. He'd never seen them before in his life. I
                    remember looking out of the window at the hospital and watching this brave
                    little boy, this little soldier, marching right along between these two complete
                    strangers without any idea where his mother and his father were. There was no
                    way that they could explain it to a two-year old that he could understand. Well,
                    my heart just was broken.</p>
                <p>Next, I sent a telegram to Algiers to advise Walt that Thomas had arrived. Well,
                    Wednesday turned into Thursday and Thursday turned into Friday, and I heard
                    nothing from Walt. On Friday morning, Dr. Castro came in and said, “You can go
                    home now.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>CUTLER: I said, “Well, I have a little problem. I don't have any home to go to.”
                    I gave him a brief explanation, and he said, “Well, all right, you can stay
                    another night.” Walt was supposed to come up that Saturday — that had been
                    arranged before we left — and since I had heard nothing else, I assumed the
                    plans were the same. So I stayed in the hospital another night and the next
                    morning — I'm still in my bathrobe because I didn't have any clothes with me — I
                    signed a promissory note in the hospital that I would come back and pick up my
                    baby. Apparently, sometimes women leave hospitals and never come back for their
                    babies. I then took a taxi back to the “Hilton,” where I went up to the desk to
                    collect my bag. Now it's about ten o'clock in the morning and the lobby is full
                    of people. I said, “I'm here to pick up my suitcase.” They said, “We don't know
                    anything about your suitcase.” That was the last straw. I stood right there at
                    the desk, and I cried. This time, there was an American behind the desk, and he
                    said, “I think what you need to do is go to the hairdresser, and I will find
                    your luggage.”</p>
                <p>So I walked into the hairdresser, still wearing the plastic wristband, still in
                    my bathrobe. I felt that I needed to explain loudly enough so that everyone in
                    there would understand why I was in this state. One of the other patrons was a
                    nurse from the hospital, and she said, “I think there's some luggage, unclaimed
                    luggage, in the patients' clothing room over at the hospital. Maybe it's yours.”
                    I got a taxi back, and indeed it was my luggage, so I changed my clothes and I
                    picked up my baby, and I went back to the Torrejon “Hilton” again to wait for
                    Walt. He did arrive as expected, and the Copelands took Allen out to the airport
                    to meet him and drove him to our hotel. And it's funny — I think it's funny. He
                    walked in our room, and the first thing I remember him saying — now, my memory
                    may be faulty here — was, “I would have brought you some candy, but do you know
                    how expensive candy is in Algiers?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: There ensued a week of madness because now all four of us are staying at
                    the Torrejon “Hilton.” I have a brand new infant in diapers and a two-year old,
                    I'm sorry to say, still in diapers. One or the other of them had developed a
                    staph infection, so that as I went between the two, I had to wash my hands with
                    Phisohex and change diapers and then go and wash my hands with Phisohex again.
                    Walt would go down for dinner at night to the hotel restaurant with Allen. I
                    would stay with Thomas. Then Walt would come back and stay with both the
                    children and I would go down and eat alone.</p>
                <p>One night when I was having dinner by myself, a rather nice-looking man came over
                    and made me kind of an invitation. I just felt so good about that. I thought,
                    “After all I've been through and I'm barely week out of the delivery room!” That
                    was awfully good for my morale.</p>
                <p>The bottom line is that ten days after Thomas was born and Allen's ears were
                    done, we were back in Algeria. Now, whoever said the Foreign Service isn't
                    glamorous? Whoever said that? That's glamour!</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] That is indeed!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: But I must say I was enormously proud of myself for having managed the
                    situation. What had happened with the telegram I had sent and the reason I got
                    no response was that Walt had tripped over a fragment of it in the code room in
                    the embassy on Friday. All that was left of it was “Walt Cutler, American
                    Embassy Algiers, Love Sally.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: The message was gone. Since he was coming up the next day anyway, I guess
                    he just figured, “Well, whatever it is can wait twenty-four hours.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] Oh, that is extraordinary!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: One other little story connected to that. Walt had the foresight to know
                    that if we ever needed birth certificates for Thomas, we'd better get all we
                    needed right there and then from Torrejon because it wouldn't be easy to get
                    them by mail later. So he took himself down to the town offices and asked to
                    have six birth certificates. These were all filled in by hand by the mayor, or
                    whoever it was who was filling them out. Thomas's name is Thomas Gerard Cutler.
                    Well, the middle name the mayor wrote as “Gerald,” and, of course, each one had
                    to be corrected. The mayor put a little White-Out over each of the “l”s, and
                    then he laid the six certificates on the balcony railing to dry, at which point
                    a gust of wind came along, and all six birth certificates flew into the air and
                    floated down the street in Torrejon with Walt and the mayor in hot pursuit. So
                    even Thomas's birth certificates had a strange beginning.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: So that was a Foreign Service birthing experience. I don't know how many
                    others have had one like that, but I thought mine was different.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: From there, we went directly to Tabriz, in northwestern Iran, '65 to '67.
                    That was when the Shah was there. Not under the Khomeini regime.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another Muslim country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Tabriz was a fascinating place. At the time we were there, there were any
                    number of German archaeological teams excavating all around that area. One of
                    the things we used to do was to pack up the kids and take off on the weekends,
                    drive to the sites and spend the weekends camping and watching the excavations
                    and finding out what they were getting. It was really an idyllic spot.</p>
                <p>When we arrived — the reason for that post, it was a listening post, really. We
                    bordered southern Russia and Kurdistan. There was always trouble with the Kurds,
                    so it was a listening post, a small post. Walt was the consul. We had a vice
                    consul and a GSO whose wife was the secretary. For about the first year, we had
                    a couple of Seabees who were overseeing the construction of the new consulate
                    residence and chancery building, office building. The building had been designed
                    by a famous American architect named Edward Larabee Barnes. He designed the
                    Dallas Art Museum, and the Reagan Library, I think. Maybe it was the Nixon. I
                    don't remember. But anyway, he's right up there with I. M. Pei, and whatever his
                    name is? The fellow who di...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Stone, who designed the buildings in New Delhi. Barnes had the idea that
                    he would build these buildings to resemble Turkish baths because he wanted
                    something that looked Iranian. So we had domes. When we first arrived there, the
                    building was under construction, and the Seabees, of course, were there to make
                    sure that they weren't planting listening devices as they were erecting the
                    building.</p>
                <p>The house that we first stayed in was the old consulate residence, and it was
                    just charming. It was on a “kuch�,” an alley, with high walls. You came in the
                    door and there was a sprawling, wonderful house that went on forever, with huge
                    rooms and high ceilings and great, big windows looking out on to an enclosed
                    courtyard. It was a little shabby. It was furnished with cast-off furniture from
                    the embassy residence in Tehran, but it was elegant shabby. Wonderful old stuff,
                    gorgeous Persian rugs. Huge fireplace. It was a divine place to live. It was
                    great, except when the mud ceiling in the kitchen collapsed on the cook's head
                    after a heavy rainfall. After that, he wore one of the boys' toy soldier
                    helmets!</p>
                <p>But eventually, the day came when we had to move into Edward Larabee Barnes's
                    building. It was a disaster from a functional point of view, which has led me to
                    believe that architects truly value form over function. The walls were probably
                    a foot thick because there'd been a severe earthquake a couple of centuries
                    earlier in Tabriz, so, of course, he was preparing for the next one. The windows
                    were slits. They looked like the slits in medieval castles.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For arrows. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: There was no way you could curtain the windows because if you put
                    curtains on them, you had no light at all. The living room was domed, so some
                    light also came from the ceiling, but it created a bizarre acoustical effect. If
                    you had a dinner party and somebody was standing in the far righthand corner of
                    the room whispering, it was clearly audible to the person standing in the
                    opposite corner of the room, so, of course, it was lousy for diplomatic
                    gatherings.</p>
                <p>There was a kitchen with no drawers in it. There was no place for servants to sit
                    down or change their clothes or take a rest or go to the bathroom. The only way
                    that they could get from the kitchen to the family/sleeping area was to go
                    through the living room. If I had a group of women there in the morning for a
                    coffee, Mastura and Rubaba would come through with their buckets and pails and
                    mops, wearing their head scarves, lumping through the living room, right through
                    the guests and on to clean up the bedrooms!</p>
                <p>It was a totally impractical house. The most impractical thing about it was that
                    the guest room was just to the right of the front door, and at the far corner of
                    the guest room was a bathroom. That was the only bathroom accessible to
                    reception guests. So we had the unfortunate experience once of having the
                    ambassador and his wife from Tehran for a weekend visit. We put on a large
                    reception, and the only way that people who attended the reception could get to
                    the bathroom was to go through the ambassador's bedroom to their bathroom. It
                    was bizarre, just bizarre.</p>
                <p>Being a polemicist at heart, I sat down and wrote Mr. Barnes a letter. I told him
                    in no uncertain terms what I thought of his design! I reminded him that this was
                    not just somebody's private house. It had a dual function, both private and
                    public. It was located in a country where servants were essential and where
                    there was a great deal of entertaining and you really didn't want a combined
                    living/dining room, so that the people after dinner could watch the servants
                    clearing the table. Of course, Walt, who was a much more cautious and diplomatic
                    person than I, said, “You can't send it.” So I didn't.</p>
                <p>But I got to him indirectly years later in Jane Loeffler's book called The
                    Architecture of Diplomacy, [Princeton Architectural Press,1998], where she
                    detailed my complaints. I think the FBO [Foreign Buildings Office], which
                    selects the designs of diplomatic residences abroad, should solicit input during
                    the planning process from the wives who live and work in them. After all, who
                    knows more about what works and what doesn't? The wives!</p>
                <p>Aside from that, I think Tabriz was our happiest post. It was small. It was
                    remote. Not that Yaounde wasn't small and remote, but by then we had a family,
                    and it was a wonderful place for a family.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>We had a donkey named Gloria, which the kids rode. I have a movie of my parents
                    and us playing croquet and my Mother is pushing Gloria out of the way so she can
                    hit her ball! Gloria occasionally walked right in the front door. We also had a
                    small fox named Peter for a while, and we inherited an Irish setter named Tinker
                    from our predecessors. Animals were a consistent theme in our Foreign Service
                    life.</p>
                <p>Allen was five, and it was time for him to begin school. I'd had him in a French
                    garderie d'enfants in Algiers, but now it was time for real school.</p>
                <p>Speaking of the nursery school in Algiers, I went to pick Allen up one day and
                    found him with duct tape over his mouth! He was only three. The French teacher
                    did that when children interrupted. I was furious!</p>
                <p>Well, there was no school for Allen in Tabriz, so I had to teach him myself with
                    the Calvert System. I'm not a trained teacher, but I ordered the materials, and
                    every morning Allen and I would leave home and go over to the consulate
                    building, where we had a little space which was our school room. I felt we
                    needed to make the separation between home and school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely. Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: For the first few days it was slow going because Allen had to go to the
                    bathroom every few minutes, and then he had to have a drink of water every other
                    minute. When he got over that, we hummed away. To be honest, anybody who can
                    read can teach Calvert. It's not a huge challenge because it's written out in
                    such a way: “Ask (Student), 'How much are two and two?' If (Student) says,
                    'Four,' say, 'Good for you, (Student)!' “</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: So that's how we spent our mornings. Allen has gone on to become a
                    successful investment banker, having been graduated from Exeter and then from
                    Amherst College, and I often remind him that he owes his success to his early
                    education by his mother and that I hope he keeps that in mind because some day
                    I'm going to ask for him to return the favor in one way or another.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: And he will say something like, “I'm going to find the nicest nursing
                    home money can buy.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: But that was another experience that I think Foreign Service wives don't
                    routinely have. I don't know whether you ever had to do any of that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I'm glad I did. It was fun.</p>
                <p>The French consul there was a bachelor who looked exactly like Mr. Peepers. He
                    was kind of a touchy little fellow with rimless glasses and a pinched face. But
                    there were two things about Pierre that I will always remember. One was, he and
                    I shared a passion for caviar, and the most wonderful caviar in the world comes
                    from that Caspian area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes! Yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: It's called golden caviar and it is truly golden. He would go down to
                    Tehran and return with a kilo — a kilo! — of golden caviar and come to our
                    house. Walt didn't like caviar. Well, that was fine. Pierre and I would sit on
                    opposite sides of a coffee table with this two pounds of caviar in front of us
                    and everything you need to go with it, and we would just eat until we were
                    nearly sick. I loved him for that.</p>
                <p>The other thing was that every time he gave a dinner party, he ended it the same
                    way. He would take a bottle of champagne and a long saber, and he would stand up
                    and hold the bottle in his left hand, slightly canted forward, and he'd take the
                    saber and massage this bottle right up the neck, right up to the cork, and it
                    was very dramatic. He gave it everything. Then, all of a sudden, there was a
                    fierce whack! He'd knock the whole neck off the bottle, clean as a whistle, and
                    the champagne would bubble out! There was never a sliver of glass. It was as
                    clean a cut as you've ever seen. He said this was a trick that he'd learned from
                    the Foreign Legionnaires, and I suppose he probably did. But I always remember
                    Pierre's dinner parties because of that little finale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's quite a dramatic finish.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>CUTLER: The only other dramatic finish I ever saw was once when we were in Rome
                    visiting Allen and Marilyn Holmes some years later. She had the most elegant — I
                    think he was an Ethiopian — houseman. He was wonderful looking. He was right out
                    of “Othello!” After dinner, for dessert, he came out with a silver tray upon
                    which sat this exquisite, woven, loosely woven, amber-colored basket, filled
                    with a bombe, an ice cream bombe. I took a spoonful of the ice cream, and then
                    he took the spoon from my hand and he rapped this basket so sharply that it
                    broke! Well, I just sucked in my breath! I thought, “Oh, my goodness!” Of
                    course, you're right: it was spun sugar. Those little effects are absolutely
                    wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Missing in our day-to-day lives.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Missing now. While we were in Tabriz, I took Farsi language training
                    every day, and I liked it. I found that Farsi was a very easy language for me
                    and, I think, probably for most Westerners because it's an Indo-European
                    language. The sounds are not impossible to make and the sentence construction is
                    very much like ours. I had a fair proficiency in Farsi by the time we left. I
                    don't have it any more because I don't ever use it. My teacher was a Bahai
                    woman, and I've often wondered since whatever became of her and her family when
                    Khomeini took over.</p>
                <p>This was not to be our last contact with Iran. In later years, we would have
                    another contact, and I'll get to that in due course.</p>
                <p>When the ambassador and his wife came to visit Tabriz the first time, when we
                    were living in the old house, the day before they arrived, I went down with
                    sandfly fever, which is just a terrible, painful thing. It's like dengue fever.
                    You ache in every bone and joint. You run a high fever. You're practically
                    delirious. The whole time they were there, I never saw them. I took to my bed
                    with an IV drip. So that was one way of getting through a visit with the
                    ambassador and his wife! But on the whole, despite the fact that we served in
                    posts where health conditions were, to say the least, perilous, we were
                    extremely fortunate. None of us ever had malaria. None of us ever had amoebic
                    dysentery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Neither did we.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: We did have some problems with worms and that kind of thing — tapeworms
                    and giardia — but those are manageable. But I would say that we were all
                    remarkably healthy for the entire time that we were in the Foreign Service when
                    we were in these very remote and difficult places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we were so young and really didn't think about it. Did
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>CUTLER: No, but, you know, I'd come home on leave and it took me a while to
                    adjust to the idea that I could brush my teeth, turn the tap water on, wet my
                    toothbrush, and brush my teeth, and then fill a cup full of water from the tap
                    and drink it because, of course, we boiled and filtered everything. You washed
                    your lettuce in potassium permanganate. A great deal of my time in these places
                    was spent supervising the kitchen help. You couldn't leave them unsupervised
                    because, of course, they would take shortcuts. It's much quicker to put water in
                    a bottle and stick it in the fridge than it is to boil and filter it. So you
                    really had to constantly oversee this kind of thing. But we escaped without any
                    serious problems of any kind.</p>
                <p>We had one memorable adventure while we were in Tabriz. For reasons I no longer
                    remember, we made a trip to Afghanistan, which we entered through the Khyber
                    Pass from Peshawar in northwest Pakistan. We were accompanied by, or maybe we
                    accompanied, a U.S. military colonel, who insisted on taking photographs in the
                    pass despite numerous signs in English that banned the taking of photographs.
                    Suddenly, a fierce-looking Pathan appeared out of nowhere with his eye fixed
                    steadily on the colonel's camera. The colonel quickly tore the film from the
                    camera before it was seized by the sentry. I thought, “Oh, my God, we're going
                    to be imprisoned in some dreary guardhouse in the Khyber Pass and no one will
                    ever know what happened us!” It was a tense few minutes before he allowed us to
                    continue on.</p>
                <p>From Tabriz we went directly to Seoul, again to serve with Ambassador Porter, at
                    his request. There, we lived in a compound on Yongsan military base, and for
                    that reason I think Korea is the least favorite of the posts that we had, for
                    me, because the size of the American community in Korea was fifty thousand
                    military and dependents and so on, a big embassy and a military mission, which
                    made it nearly impossible to get to know and spend time with Koreans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think the language ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Not only is the language difficult, but many of the Koreans spoke
                    English. They'd had our military there for years. So the minute you tried to
                    speak Korean, they would answer you in English. It would have taken me a
                    lifetime to become as proficient in Korean as most of them were in English. So
                    there wasn't much incentive to learn the language. You rarely got away from the
                    American presence.</p>
                <p>I remember a friend of ours there, who was a contractor with AID. He said he was
                    going to write a paper on the PX as a way of life. You couldn't go ten
                    kilometers without falling over a PX. And the compound was such that you could
                    literally be born, married, live, die and be buried within the walls and never
                    set foot outside of it. I found that very discouraging, so my memories of Korea
                    are not ... I don't have a lot of wonderful or unhappy memories. There's not
                    much that stands out for me in Korea.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>We did go to Taechon beach and and rent a house that had once been a missionary's
                    house. We'd take the kids and go to the beach, and it was beautiful. The Koreans
                    are charming and interesting and energetic. We just didn't get to know them very
                    well.</p>
                <p>At that time I was working, volunteering, as the advertising manager for the
                    American Women's Club publication. Another friend of mine, Martha Olmsted, and I
                    did this together. We had a little ... I had a little Volkswagen. She had one,
                    too. Walt and I had that Volkswagen from the day we left Yaounde until the day
                    we left Korea, and it went everywhere with us. We, Martha and I, would drive
                    downtown, and what Korean drivers did then was when they wanted to pass, they
                    would roll down the driver's window and slap their arms on the sides of their
                    cars and make this awful racket. Well, Martha and I would drive all over
                    downtown Seoul doing the same thing!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: And, of course, we did then have a chance to get in a little to Korean
                    society. We talked with the Korean merchants to solicit advertising, and that
                    was kind of fun. But opportunities were very limited.</p>
                <p>I remember a farewell party that was given for us when we left. I had taken a
                    whole bunch of evening clothes down to the thrift shop to sell, and to my
                    delight, I went down a week or two later and they'd all been sold and I got a
                    nice check, and I thought, “This is wonderful!” We arrived at our farewell party
                    and all the women were wearing my clothes!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: They'd all gone to the thrift shop and bought these things. [laughter] It
                    was just a wonderful sight to walk in and there are these clothes that I'd
                    thought were out of my life forever!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: So we had good times. We knew a lot of awfully nice people in Korea, but,
                    unfortunately, most of the ones we knew were Americans or Brits because that was
                    who we saw. I also did a bit of volunteer work on the DMZ with the Red Cross.
                    We'd go up and go through the hospital on the DMZ.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Then, in 1969, at the height of the war, Walt was assigned to the embassy in
                    Vietnam. He was in the political section, of course, not in the military. The
                    State Department gave me some options. They said I could go home to the States
                    or I could go to Bangkok or to the Philippines where a lot of the dependent
                    wives and families were waiting for their men who would get leave every three or
                    six months or something and come visit. I'd heard enough about those living
                    situations that I didn't think that was what I wanted to do. I didn't think I
                    wanted to be in a community of a lot of wives who spent time at the clubs and
                    swimming pools. I just didn't think it was going to be the environment that I
                    wanted for myself and the boys. So I asked the State Department ... in a moment
                    of inspiration, I said, “Look, I'd like to go live in Oxford, England.” I
                    couldn't really go back to the States. I'd been out of the States continuously
                    since 1962. I'd been seven years out of the States. We didn't own a house in the
                    States. My mother and father were living in Beirut, and my sister, my only
                    sibling, was living in England with her husband, who was a British diplomat. She
                    had met him in Pakistan where she was with my family in the early sixties.</p>
                <p>Here's a curious story. When we arrived in Zaire in the mid-seventies, I
                    discovered that the Turkish ambassador, Bechet Tureman, had been best man in my
                    sister's wedding in Pakistan fifteen years or so earlier!</p>
                <p>In any case, there was nothing to bring me back to the States. I had an uncle who
                    was a professor of medicine at Oxford. So I said I'd like to live in Oxford, and
                    the State Department said okay, but you're to have nothing to do with the
                    embassy in London. You are not to expect them to provide you with any services
                    or support, and I said fine. That suited me to a tee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you got all your housing. They took care of all of
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes, the government paid for my housing. They would have paid for it in
                    Manila or wherever. So off I went and I rented a wonderful house at the end of a
                    lane called Jack Straw's Lane, right in Oxford. It was a great, big, old English
                    country house that I rented for some ridiculously low price from a Spanish
                    professor from Oxford who was on a long sabbatical. It came with an apple
                    orchard and a gardener. I had a cleaning woman named Mrs. Pearson. I remember I
                    paid her five shillings an hour.</p>
                <p>The house was colder than cold, and I had every heating device known to man in
                    that house. I had something called background heating. I had night storage
                    heating. I had oil heating. I had fireplaces. I had electric heaters. With all
                    of them going at once, you could never get the temperature up to sixty-five. I
                    mean, it was a freezing cold house, but you adapt.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>I remember sending the boys off to this dear little British private school called
                    Greycoats. They'd go off with their little grey shorts and their little blue
                    knee socks, and the skin between the top of the knee socks and the bottom of
                    those pants would be the color of beets, and their little cheeks would be
                    crimson. But it was wonderful for them. The school was marvelous, and they fit
                    in and it worked wonderfully well. I just loved it there! Walt would come every
                    six months for a visit, and he spent most of his time sitting in front of the
                    fireplace wrapped in a quilt because he was coming from Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I'm sure he couldn't understand how we'd survived. I took some courses in
                    architecture at the university as an auditor, and I really had just a
                    fascinating time.</p>
                <p>We did a lot of traveling. I think I've immunized the boys against museums
                    forever! They were in and out of so many museums that I've never seen them show
                    much enthusiasm since. I think they just had an overload. But it was a wonderful
                    sort of normal life, and we were not involved in embassy social life. I found it
                    terrific. I also think that it contributed to the end of the marriage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you're not the first person to say that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: If I decided that we were going to leave the house at eight o'clock in
                    the morning, we left at eight o'clock in the morning. I planned where we were
                    going to go. I chose the children's schools. I was involved in their school
                    affairs. I paid the bills. Then, all of a sudden, back from Vietnam came my
                    husband, who said to me one day when we got in an elevator, “I'm supposed to
                    push the button.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no. Oh, no, he didn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I was not prepared to be reduced to such helpless dependency that I
                    couldn't push my own elevator button at that point in my life. Now I don't think
                    he said that. He wasn't confrontational about it. It was some light-hearted
                    comment like, “Well, you always get to the elevator button before I do,” or
                    something. No, I was used to getting the elevator button by then. But I do think
                    it made a contribution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a number of people have said that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>CUTLER: So I think there is an inherent danger in long separations in any
                    marriage, and perhaps, in a way, even more so in the Foreign Service where,
                    because of the places where you're living when you're separated, you need to be
                    able to cope on your own a little bit more than you do if your separation is in
                    Greenwich, Connecticut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely. Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: S...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although I have to say your separation in Oxford ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: It was hardly painful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... sounds ideal for you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Hardly painful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, while we were there ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Walt was doing his tour in Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I remember once he told me, “I'm coming through with [Ambassador] Bunker.
                    We're coming through London and going to Washington for ... “ You know, one of
                    their official things. So I was thrilled. I was going to go down to London and
                    meet him. Because he was coming in at night, I rented a car with a driver. We
                    were going to have a couple of days together. I arranged for the kids to stay
                    with an American friend whose husband was a doctor studying endocrinology at
                    Oxford. Then, I got a phone call, and he said, “We're in London. We're not going
                    to stay over after all. We're going straight through.” In effect, “Sorry about
                    that.” And off they went. I was just crushed. It didn't sound to me as though he
                    really was that crushed. He was so focused on what he was doing that he didn't
                    sense the depth of my disappointment or appreciate the preparations I had
                    made.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Just prior to that time, Allen had had an emergency appendectomy, and I had
                    rushed him down to the Radcliffe Infirmary at night, where he was operated on
                    instantly when he went in the door and stayed a week afterwards. Of course, in
                    those days, people stayed in the hospital. When the time came for me to pay, I
                    said, “Where do I go to pay the bill?” They said, “You don't owe anything!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is remarkable!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Socialized medicine!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Here was this non-tax-paying American dependent who had a wonderful week
                    in this hospital, absolutely perfect care, and it didn't cost anything. So I can
                    go on and on and on about England. England was really a lovely time, but it
                    wasn't Foreign Service. It was only tangentially Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>During that time, I read an article in the Paris Herald Tribune that really
                    raised my hackles. It was written by an American psychologist, who claimed that
                    he based it on many interviews with Foreign Service children. He painted a bleak
                    picture of the effects of the Foreign Service on Foreign Service children and
                    the dangers inherent in living abroad and the threat that your child might be
                    molested by pedophiles who were servants in your house and how these children
                    missed out on all the wonderful things that American children are, in effect,
                    entitled to enjoy in their lives and said something ridiculous like, “They learn
                    to hate the United States and everything it stands for,” and so on. Well, I just
                    thought, “This is irresponsible!” So I sat down at my typewriter, and I banged
                    out a long letter to the editor, and to my utter amazement, they published the
                    whole thing as an op-ed piece. Now I can't find it. I don't know where it
                    is.</p>
                <p>But I said that I suspected that the Foreign Service children upon whom he had
                    based this study were only those children who were having problems and had come
                    to him for that reason, and that I couldn't see that he had used a control group
                    of Foreign Service children who were not having problems to validate his
                    study.</p>
                <p>At that time, riots were underway in Berkeley and Columbia. So I said, “I'd be
                    willing to bet you that there's no critical mass of those students who are
                    Foreign Service children. I'm pretty sure it's not Foreign Service children who
                    are fomenting riots in our colleges and saying that the U.S. Government is no
                    good and down with the Government and down with the President and 'Hey, hey,
                    LBJ, how many kids have you killed today?'”</p>

                <p>My experience has been that Foreign Service children learn to love America and
                    all it stands for because of their overseas experience, particularly kids, like
                    yours and mine, who have spent a significant part of their childhoods in Third-
                    and Fourth-World countries. They see the lack of freedom and opportunity that
                    most of the rest of the world has, whereas you come back here and it's
                    open-sesame. Everything's here. So I felt very pleased that at least I got that
                    word out, and that is still my feeling.</p>
                <p>I have always felt that children who have — I know that this is not always true
                    ... but I think a big contributor to Foreign Service children's problems is very
                    often the mother's resentment of the demands and “deprivations” of the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're absolutely right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Her indirect way of expressing that resentment and getting back, if you
                    will, at her husband who has put her in these circumstances, is to remind these
                    children all the time, “Well, you can't be a Cub Scout,” or “You don't have a
                    room of your own to grow up in.” I think that to the extent that the mother is
                    content with what she's doing and finds it to be an adventure and communicates
                    it as an adventure and brings her children into the romance — and there is
                    romance in the Foreign Service, whatever you say about it — I think the children
                    can come out of it pretty healthy. I'm sure that somebody will argue with me
                    about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think so. My experience with that was in Rotterdam
                        in 1958 when the Consul General arrived with his wife and two little boys,
                        and the two little boys said, “We don't think we're going to like Rotterdam.
                        We're going back into government housing.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: You see, that's exactly it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was mother one-hundred percent. My children didn't
                        know if a house was government housing or privately rented.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: No, this was just not an issue. Our children were growing up in a
                    situation where they didn't know people who had their own rooms their whole
                    lives. Everybody else was in the same boat.</p>

                <p>CUTLER: I'm a little bit ... I think sometimes we tend to ... well, of course,
                    this is the society we live in now. Everybody's a victim. We made Foreign
                    Service children “victims.” I don't think they're victims. I think they're
                    extremely lucky.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some are victims.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Some are.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like the manic depressives and ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: But manic depressives don't become manic depressive because of the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You don't think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Oh, no, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You think they're manic depressive before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Manic depression is a chemical disorder. It is wired into the brain, into
                    the genes, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you don't think the Foreign Service exacerbates it?
                        The Foreign Service experience surely must exacerbate it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, I think if they're in the depressed stage of this bipolar disorder
                    that probably certain things that happen in the Foreign Service can exacerbate
                    it, but I think ... I am somewhat familiar with manic depression, not
                    personally, but in my family. Clinical depression is another thing. It can be
                    brought on by a variety of factors. But not manic depression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but I think you're right about the children. I think
                        not only the mother's attitude, but the whole parental attitude towards the
                        Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Exactly. You have to have the “Goody, goody, goody! Here we go again,
                    this time to Freetown, Sierra Leone!” [laughter]</p>

                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Later on, when Walt was assigned to Zaire, Thomas, my younger son, who
                    had never lived in the States until we returned in 19 ... I guess, he'd never
                    lived there until we returned in 1972 from England. He was ten. No, no, he was
                    eight. Then, three years later, we were going to go off to Zaire, and Thomas
                    said, “Not me! I just love it here! I love McDonalds! I love hamburgers and ice
                    cream,” and so on. Allen, who's always been the other diplomat in the family ...
                    I heard Allen say to Thomas, “We can fly first class.” Well, Thomas just
                    brightened right up! That did it for him because whenever we flew anywhere,
                    Thomas was always peeking through the curtains into the first-class section and
                    coming back to report that they have table cloths and linen napkins and flowers.
                    Now, finally, because Walt was going to be an ambassador, we could get into the
                    first-class section. That was all it took. Thomas was ready to go!</p>
                <p>Anyway, we came back from England in ... I think it was '72. Walt went into the
                    African Bureau, as far as I remember. Not long after we came back, the
                    ambassador in Cambodia asked Walt to come out as DCM to Phnom Penh, and Walt
                    tentatively agreed. In fact, I don't think he was even tentative about it. I
                    think he said yes, he'd do it. I had a real problem with that. He'd been in
                    Vietnam for a little over two years, and now we were back in the States, and I
                    felt that maybe he needed to stay home with the kids for a while. So I said to
                    him, “I think you ought to talk this over with the kids.”</p>
                <p>Now you'll see why this matters in a minute. Walt is allergic to cats and dogs.
                    Although we always had them, we lived in places where they were outdoors a lot
                    of the time. So we had a little family sit-down, and Walt said to the boys,
                    “Well, I'm going off to Cambodia and you can't go right now because there's a
                    war going on over there, but as soon as it's over, as soon as things get better,
                    you and Mother can come and join me.” Ever the optimist, Walt! And Allen said
                    nothing, which is typical of Allen. He processed that information. He probably
                    felt the best thing to do was to say nothing. Thomas said, “Good, then we can
                    get a cat!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Then, the next thing Thomas said was “I don't want to go anywhere. I love
                    it here! I love my school! I love my hamburgers and my Boy Scouts and my
                    friends.” And Walt said, “Thomas! Don't you want to see the world?” And Thomas
                    said, “I've seen it!” Ten years old, and he'd seen it. I think Walt put all of
                    that into his head and decided that maybe it wasn't such a good idea to go to
                    Cambodia at that time. If he could in fact be replaced by a cat in Thomas's
                    affections, maybe he needed to stay home. So he did.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>We were in Washington from '72 to '75, and it was during that time that I went
                    back to graduate school and got a master's degree in library science because it
                    was something I wanted to do. The kids were then in school and I could arrange
                    my classes so that I could be home when they were home.</p>
                <p>In '75, Walt was asked to go out to Zaire as ambassador, back to the place where
                    he'd spent his first night in Africa. So off we went and we hadn't been there
                    very long when the librarian at the American school, which was called TASOK [The
                    American school of Kinshasa], left, and they needed a replacement. I was freshly
                    minted as a librarian, and it just was appetizing to me. So I said to Walt one
                    night, you know, I really would like to take that job at TASOK. Walt's first
                    reaction was, “You can't do that. You're the ambassador's wife. You can't do
                    that.” I said, “Well, why not?” So, he thought about it, and he said, “Well, I
                    guess I can't really think of any good reason that you can't do it if you can
                    still manage to do the entertaining.” So I did. It was a paid job. I think when
                    I took that job in '76, I may have been the first ambassador's wife in the
                    American Foreign Service to actually hold a full-time, salaried job outside the
                    embassy. This was not an embassy job. This was an independent school,
                    international school.</p>
                <p>I got a mixed reaction from the wives of the other ambassadors, the seventy-four
                    ambassadors in town. The Swedish ambassador's wife, who lived across the street
                    from me, was green with envy. She thought I was the luckiest person in the
                    world. The Dutch ambassador's wife, who was a frowzy, old Albanian, was
                    outraged, outraged, that I would let down the side and not play my appropriate
                    role as the wife of an ambassador and attend the luncheons and the tea
                    parties.</p>
                <p>One of the lovely things about being the wife of the American ambassador almost
                    anywhere is that it really doesn't much matter what the other ambassadors' wives
                    think. Your husband is, by virtue of the country he represents, the diplomatic
                    VIP.</p>
                <p>This reminds me of a wonderful story. It may be apocryphal, but I heard the story
                    years and years ago. At the Foreign Service Institute, an ambassador came to
                    speak to the wives. Do you know this story?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: The wives were all there, and he said, “Now, I'm going to leave the room
                    and give you five minutes to seat yourselves according to rank, and then I'll
                    come back in.” So he left, and a terrible fight took place! There was all sorts
                    of juggling for position and so on. Eventually, they were all uneasily seated
                    some way or other, and he came back in the room. He said, “Now, I have one thing
                    to tell you. None of you has any rank. Your husbands have the rank. That's what
                    I'm here to tell you today.” I thought that was a lesson well learned.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>There were some women I knew in the Foreign Service who never learned that and
                    who didn't understand that you are not “Mrs. Ambassador.” You are not Madame
                    l'Ambassadrice. You are Mrs. Cutler or Mrs. Fenzi. Your husband has the rank,
                    and that's the end of it. What I got out of by doing the library work was the
                    endless, endless women's functions.</p>
                <p>As you know, the newest wife in town has to call on all the other ambassadors'
                    wives in order of precedence. Once I realized that this was my task, I set about
                    it in a very systematic way. Week after week, every Wednesday morning and every
                    Thursday morning, I would set out to pay my calls. Well, the last call I made
                    was on the French ambassador's wife because they arrived just prior to our
                    arrival which meant that they were the next to the last and so that's the last
                    one you call on.</p>
                <p>I'd just gotten back to the house and was breathing a huge sigh of relief that
                    this was finally behind me when I got a telephone call from Walt's secretary,
                    saying that the French ambassador's wife had just called to ask when she could
                    make a return call. My heart sank into my shoes! I said, “Never!” The thought
                    that I was going to have to go through this in reverse and spend the next
                    several Thursday mornings and Wednesday mornings of my life doing this thing, I
                    couldn't face it. So instead, I had a series of three or four morning coffees,
                    and I invited a clutch of ambassadors' wives to each of these until I had them
                    all back and that was the end of it. Now that did not go down well again with
                    the Dutch ambassador's wife, but I really didn't care about her, so I ignored
                    it.</p>
                <p>When we were assigned to Zaire, I wanted to take my old, beaten-up, black
                    Volkswagen which we had bought secondhand after the first one that we had all
                    the early years in the Foreign Service had been sold in Korea. It came with
                    dents and scrapes and scratches, but I loved it. So before we left to go to
                    Zaire, I said to Walt, “I want to take my car with me.” He said, “Well, there'll
                    be an official car for you to use, and I don't think it would be appropriate for
                    you to drive this Volkswagen in Kinshasa.” So I said, “Well, look, I really want
                    this car.” It was kind of reminiscent of my exchange with Michel back in
                    Cameroon. Again, I gave Walt a choice: “I go with the car or I stay home with
                    the car, but the car and I are staying together.” So the car went. I never used
                    the official car except for paying those calls that I had to pay because I
                    preferred to drive myself. It was my schedule, my time, and where I wanted to
                    go, and I just didn't like being driven around.</p>
                <p>The DCM's wife there also had the use of an embassy car, and she liked it fine.
                    Most people did. There were many people, I think, in Kinshasa who right until
                    the end thought that she was the ambassador's wife because she went around in an
                    official embassy car and I didn't.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>One day I was driving down the street, the main street of Kinshasa, which is
                    called the Le Trente Juin. The streets were going to hell in a handcart like
                    every other piece of infrastructure in Zaire. The traffic lights didn't work, so
                    at the intersection they had a tall kiosk with two Zairian gendarmes on top, who
                    were directing the traffic by hand. I drove up to this intersection, and it was
                    time for my line of traffic to stop. They put their hands out, and I stopped and
                    waited. Finally, they waved my line on. I was at the head of the line, and as I
                    got right beneath the kiosk, they motioned me to stop, which I did. I rolled
                    down the driver's window and looked way up there — they were way up there — and
                    the gendarme said to me, “Are you the wife of the American ambassador?” I said
                    yes. A big smile crossed his face from one ear to the other, and he waved me on,
                    and I knew exactly what had happened. While I was waiting there, he'd said to
                    his friend, “You see that woman down there driving that black, beaten-up, old
                    car? That's the American ambassador's wife.” And his sidekick had said, “No way!
                    Ambassadors' wives don't drive themselves around and certainly not in a car like
                    that!” They probably had a bet and he won. So I made his day.</p>
                <p>We had our own automobile repair service at the embassy. We had our own
                    everything there. You had to have it. So I took the car in one day to get a
                    grease job or something like that, and the head of the garage, who was a
                    Zairian, said to me, “You know, Madame l'Ambassadrice, it's really embarrassing
                    that you drive this car.” He thought this because so often their status is
                    derivative of yours. And I said, “Well, you know something? If more of your
                    government officials drove cars like this instead of Mercedes,” which were
                    imported by the hundreds at God knows what price and ninety percent of them
                    ended up wrapped around a tree somewhere, “there would be medicines in your
                    hospitals and food in your markets, and your policemen and your soldiers would
                    be paid instead of holding you guys up every time you have a payday because
                    they're not getting paid.” I said, “Think about it.” So I drove that car the
                    whole time we were there.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>While I was working at the American school — and I would say that the population
                    of that school was probably sixty percent American and forty percent other — I
                    became concerned that these kids were really not getting any sense of what life
                    was like for Zairians. It was about the time of the senior prom, and they were
                    planning an elaborate dance with all of the ruffles and flourishes that proms
                    have these days, trying to imitate what they would have if they were back in
                    Bethesda or wherever. I proposed to the principal, and he agreed, that we take
                    them on a field trip to Mama Yemo Hospital, the big hospital in Kinshasa. I'd
                    been there before. So off we went for a field trip, and the kids were laughing
                    and joking and having a wonderful time. Then we toured the hospital, and there
                    were children there dying of starvation, and there were children there with
                    kwashiorkor disease where their bellies become bloated and their hair turns red.
                    There were people lying on the floors in the hallways, and if they were in beds,
                    the beds had no mattresses. They were lying on bare springs. The families were
                    there around them, cooking and taking care of the patients. They had three and
                    four babies in an incubator, if they had an incubator. They had no medicines. I
                    mean, people were ... It was dreadful. The change in the behavior and the aspect
                    of those children from the time they started out on this trip and the time they
                    returned to school was dramatic. I felt it was very important for them as
                    they're planning this prom event to be reminded in a forceful way that it's not
                    like this for most people.</p>
                <p>I did a lot of that while I was there because I felt it was important. People
                    tend not to want to look at things like that, just the way people even in this
                    country don't like to go to nursing homes or deal with the dying because it's
                    too painful. But that's life. So I had some effect on that school besides being
                    rather tough on some of the teachers.</p>
                <p>I remember one day picking up a paper on the floor in the library. The teachers
                    at the time were all young. I think a lot of them, to be honest, were probably
                    using drugs. It was that time. There was one English teacher, a man. He was an
                    Amherst graduate. I picked up a paper that had been prepared for his class, and
                    on the top of it was an “A-” and a note saying, “Good effort!” I read the paper
                    and it was utterly illiterate! It was illiterate from a grammar, from a
                    punctuation, from a spelling, from a content point of view. It was the work of a
                    near-illiterate. Well, I marched into the principal's office with this paper,
                    and I said, “Look at this! Now, for this kind of work, this child's being given
                    an 'A!' That's unfair to that child. He's being led to believe that this kind of
                    work is regarded in the real world as acceptable. He is going to be in for a
                    rude awakening when he gets out in that real world and finds out that this is
                    totally unacceptable.” Needless to say, the English teacher was not happy with
                    me. But I stood my ground. This was a time when schools were doing these things.
                    They were working on building up everybody's self-esteem, and it really didn't
                    matter whether you could read, write, and spell as long as you felt good about
                    yourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your children in that school or were they older?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>CUTLER: Allen was there for about a year, and Thomas was there for two years, and
                    then they both went back to prep schools. There was no choice. If they had any
                    hope, I felt, of going on to any sort of distinguished higher education, they
                    really needed to come home, and we wanted them to come home.</p>
                <p>Thomas and I would drive up to the school together every morning, but Thomas
                    would insist on getting out of the car before we reached the gates because he
                    didn't want to be seen with me, the ambassador's wife. I felt sorry for him.
                    When he was driven into the residence compound on the school bus at the end of
                    the day, the kids would all start singing “The Star Spangled Banner.” This was
                    terribly embarrassing to a middle-schooler who wanted to be just like everybody
                    else. It's hard at that age to be singled out.</p>
                <p>Some Foreign Service people sent their children to schools in Europe. I was
                    opposed to that because I felt that part of the reason for coming back to school
                    in the States was to develop a circle of American friends who would remain
                    friends. I didn't want them to be alienated from their country, and so when the
                    time came that we needed to send them away to school, there was never any
                    question in my mind that they were going to school in the United States. That's
                    home. They both did, and it worked out well.</p>
                <p>We were in Zaire during the first outbreak of the Ebola virus, which now is a
                    very famous event, medical event. A team came over from the Atlanta Center for
                    Disease Control to investigate the problem and the head of the team walked into
                    Walt's office and closed the door behind him, came up very close to Walt's desk,
                    lowered his voice and said, “Mr. Ambassador, you've heard of the andromeda
                    strain?” Walt said it was quite a moment. Some panic occurred in the embassy. I
                    think there were two couples, maybe three, who actually left post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they given the option?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, I think you can't not let them go. I mean, if people really feel
                    that their lives are threatened by something like this, you can't say, “Well,
                    tough!” I think that was the right thing to do. But it also became incumbent on
                    me and Walt to be calm about it and to create an atmosphere that would not feed
                    fear in the embassy. But I do remember that it was a scary time because nobody
                    knew what was causing it or how it was spread. All everybody knew was that if
                    you got it, you were dead, and I do think that was scary.</p>
                <p>Bill Close, father of the actress Glenn Close, was then private physician to
                    Mobutu. He has since written a book on the outbreak of the Ebola virus, which
                    many people have read. I have not.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>That was one crisis we had there. Then, there were two invasions in the Shaba
                    province. These things are always reported in the newspapers at home in a way
                    that makes the people at home think this is occurring in your backyard, wherever
                    you are. Well, Shaba province was a significant distance from Kinshasa, but,
                    nevertheless, the country was at war. The French were flying in troops and the
                    Americans were sending planes and supplies. So that was quite an exciting time
                    to be there.</p>
                <p>One of the things I did at the embassy residence, we had a wonderful swimming
                    pool. We also built a tennis court while we were there. It was supposedly a
                    helicopter pad and could serve as a helipad, but, in fact, it was a tennis
                    court.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the swimming pool was a water cistern for the fire
                        department? [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: The swimming pool was already there, and I opened it up to everybody in
                    the embassy and to all the Peace Corps volunteers, at will. There were some
                    restrictions: no children could come without parents and no parents could leave
                    the children unsupervised and that kind of thing. But I didn't feel there was
                    any need for us to have a swimming pool to ourselves. The tennis court was used
                    often and so was the swimming pool. The Peace Corps volunteers really
                    appreciated it when they came in from the bush. It was wonderful to be able to
                    come to that pool and sit there or swim. I think they enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>We had a couple of Peace Corps volunteers who got sick when they were in the
                    bush, and we would take them in to our house and they stayed with us until they
                    were better or evacuated. I had a really sort of open policy when it came to the
                    embassy residence. I did not think of it as my house. I felt that others should
                    enjoy it, too. It was an interesting place right on the bank of the Congo, now
                    Zaire, River looking across it at Brazza on the other side. So it was a nice
                    place.</p>
                <p>It was also a bit of a menagerie because by then we had a cat named Ralph and the
                    monkey, Sweet Pea, and we had acquired three fighting cocks, which were gifts to
                    Walt from some ambassador. We called the rooster Brewster, and he had two wives.
                    He was as mean a bird as ever walked the face of the earth, and he was very
                    territorial. He marked out the entire embassy compound, residence compound, as
                    his private territory and, trust me, he attacked when you came onto that
                    property. He flew into the air and flapped his wings and screeched at the top of
                    his lungs and he came for you. I can remember when the kids were home visiting
                    from school. They'd go out to the pool. Brewster would tear right along behind
                    them, and they would use towels to flap-flap him away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>

                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>CUTLER: My monkey had been orphaned and was given to me by one of the children at
                    the school. Then Walt brought home a pangolin, which is an African anteater,
                    which we only had twenty-four hours because I raced up to the school and checked
                    in Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia and discovered that you can't raise these
                    animals in captivity because you can't provide them with enough ants and
                    termites to keep them going. So that had to be taken back into the jungle in the
                    middle of the night. I said to Walt after that ... he bought it in the market
                    where he'd gone with Thomas looking for green pigeons. I said, “There's not a
                    pangolin in Zaire today whose life's worth a nickel because the word is out that
                    there's a man who will buy pangolins if you bring them to the market. The place
                    is going to be flooded with pangolins!”</p>
                <p>One day, I did have a ladies lunch, and I invited several ambassadors' wives —
                    the Swede, Saudi Arabian, the Turk, the Indian. There was one other. I can't
                    remember who it was. We had lunch outdoors next to ... Oh, and the Belgian. She
                    was a very fancy dame. Her husband had been chief of protocol in Belgium, and
                    she wore impressive jewelry at all hours of the day and night, the kind of
                    jewelry that I normally wouldn't have, or if I did, I'd wear to a reception at
                    the White House, but I wouldn't wear it with my street clothes in the morning.
                    So she arrived bedecked in all her jewelry. I had Sweet Pea out there on a long
                    tether. The Belgian had a monkey of her own. She loved monkeys. So she leaned
                    down and said to Sweet Pea, “Oh, minou, minou,” and Sweet Pea sank her teeth
                    into Monique's wrist! Monique pulled away, and there was this bleeding wound in
                    her arm, so, of course, we had to rush for the alcohol and bandages.</p>
                <p>Prior to that, the Indian ambassador's wife had rolled up in her chauffeur-driven
                    car, and I suddenly remembered that we hadn't corralled Brewster. So before she
                    got out, I said, “Don't move!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: “Stay where you are!” Then all the servants and the gardeners and the
                    gendarmes who guarded the residence and I raced around the garden, which was
                    big, trying to trap Brewster, who thought this was great sport. He would dive
                    into a bush and we'd surround the bush. We thought we had him and then he would
                    fly straight up from the center of the bush, right over our heads and off to
                    another. It took us about ten minutes to get him under control. Then the
                    Belgian's bitten. Well, at that point, the Indian ambassador's wife, who'd been
                    so terrified by Brewster, now sees that Sweet Pea has bitten the Belgian
                    ambassador's wife, and she steps backwards so quickly that she came within a
                    hair of falling into the swimming pool, sari and all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, I want to tell you that I am sure that that lunch is still a topic
                    of conversation in Zaire, and I bet they were all glad that I never did it
                    again. So that was my ... Others have glamorous stories to tell about their
                    receptions and entertaining.</p>
                <p>We inherited a housekeeper, a sloppy, officious, African-born Greek named Madame
                    Despina. She rode herd mercilessly over the rest of the staff, who roundly
                    disliked her. She listened in on my telephone conversations. I'd say, “Hang up,
                    Madame Despina,” and there'd be a click on the line. She would plop herself out
                    at the pool, knees spread, hair done up in fat pink curlers. A sight! When I
                    found out that every Thursday afternoon she commandeered a car from the embassy
                    to go to the market, I began to suspect that it was the black market! So I kept
                    careful tabs on the inventory for a while and discovered that things like sugar
                    and liquor were disappearing at a rapid clip. Well, by that time, I'd gotten
                    over my fear about firing people. I gave her twenty-four hours to decamp. I
                    don't know what happened to her after that, but things worked more smoothly in
                    the house from then on.</p>
                <p>While we were there, Kissinger came twice. I am sure that at some time in your
                    life, you've been on the other end of either a presidential visit or a
                    secretary's visit, so you know what it's like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, when Kissinger traveled, he traveled with a cast of thousands. He
                    had two armored cars that leapfrogged down the coast of Africa, following him.
                    The embassy, as you know, goes into a kind of spasm for a month or more before a
                    visit like this. Nothing else can be done but preparations for the visit.
                    Finally, the day came and Kissinger arrived. He was very charming. He made a
                    particular point of stopping and taking time to talk to both the boys, and that
                    was thrilling to them.</p>
                <p>One of the evenings he was there, the Zairians gave a big performance of native
                    dancing in the stadium. It was a spectacular performance. We were driven off to
                    this event with a motorcycle police escort. Well, I was in the embassy, or in
                    Kissinger's automobile, in the back seat. He was on my right and the Foreign
                    Minister of Zaire was on my left. Walt was up front. We were hurtling through
                    Kinshasa, taking corners on two wheels and the motorcycle police sirens were
                    blaring. It was just a real chase. At one point, we went around a corner so fast
                    that I literally ended up on Kissinger's lap, practically. I said, “Oh, I'm
                    sorry, Mr. Secretary. I'm not trying to sit on your lap.” He turned to me with a
                    little smile and said, “I'm not resisting” in his heavy German accent. So he was
                    ...</p>

                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>CUTLER: I remember those visits as being just ... Everybody just went into full
                    throttle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: We had others. The Secretary of Defense was out there, Don Rumsfeld, and
                    any number of Senators and Congressmen. I remember Les Aspin came with his wife.
                    He was such a gentleman, a charming man. Normally, these Senators and
                    Congressmen, as you know, get a fistful of cash when they arrive, which they can
                    spend on anything they want. I've always thought that was a dubious practice.
                    He, at the end of his visit there, wrote a check to the embassy for every dollar
                    he had spent.</p>
                <p>The contrast was a fellow from New York — a Congressman from New York stayed —
                    who, I think, is no longer in Congress, and I don't need to name him. Well, I
                    can name him. It was Stephen Solarz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: He stayed with us, of course. When it was time for him to leave, he
                    turned around imperiously, looked at me and said, “Who's here to carry my bag?”
                    Well, I had servants who were on their way. I wanted to say to him, “Mr. Solarz,
                    who carries your bag when you leave home?” You know, this kind of thing annoyed
                    me. That's probably why I'm not a good diplomat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but I hope he left a tip. The thing that used to annoy
                        me was when they didn't tip.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: They never left tips.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, it used to make me so mad because then you had to pay
                        the tip.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Of course, we all know that they would come out on these visits and
                    expect everything. They wanted the finest food, the finest wine, the most
                    glorious entertainment. Then they would go back to Congress and say we were all
                    living too well. Well, the fact of the matter is we didn't live like that unless
                    they were visiting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>CUTLER: Mostly, it ended up coming out of your own pocket because
                    representational allowances were never adequate to cover those sorts of
                    expenses. Everybody's had that problem, and everybody in the Foreign Service
                    understands what that's like, so I'm not inventing here. I'm not telling you
                    anything new.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no, no, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: When Thomas finally went off to boarding school, it was right at the time
                    when planes everywhere were being hijacked. There was a real wave of hijacking.
                    We sent our fifteen-year old off to fly alone from Zaire to Brazza, and from
                    there to Brussels, and from Brussels to Boston. We had friends at the other end
                    who were picking him up. We waved him goodbye and off he went.</p>
                <p>I think it was probably twenty-four hours after he'd left, the middle of the
                    night, we get a phone call. Our friends in Boston had called the State
                    Department which is calling us to say, “Where's Thomas?” We thought Thomas was
                    in Boston. Well, I was just ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Frantic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: ... frantic! All I could think was, “What a plum for a hijacker!” A
                    fifteen-year-old boy with a diplomatic passport and a father who's an American
                    ambassador. What a plum! Well, Walt, of course, was worried, but he couldn't do
                    anything about it, so he went back to sleep. I stayed up all night long and
                    worried.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, dear.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: The next day or so, Thomas did turn up. His plane had broken down some
                    place along the way, and instead of flying to Brussels, he'd had to fly to
                    London. He had coped with all of this remarkably well. I mean, when I look back
                    now and think what could have happened! Some man on the plane offered him a ride
                    into London, to a hotel in London, and he took it. Today you say to your child,
                    “If anybody offers you a ride, don't take it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, we didn't say that. The only thing he ever said about it — and I
                    just think this is so Foreign Service — was, “I'll never fly Sabena again!”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Which, I think, says something about Foreign Service kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I like Thomas. Yes. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: But those kinds of things happen to everybody, to everybody.</p>
                <p>Of course, the two big highlights in Zaire are Mama Mobutu's funeral, which I may
                    have to save for another day, and then the nomination of Walt as ambassador to
                    Iran in the late spring of 1979. Almost all of us today know that the embassy
                    was taken hostage in the fall of 1979. We were giving a very, very big dinner
                    party outdoors that night that the call came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: No, we were in Zaire. The call came through at noon from Washington. We
                    were having lunch, Walt and I, outdoors. Things were going on in preparation for
                    that night. He went in to take the call and came back and he was parchment
                    color. He said to me, “They want me to go out as ambassador to Iran.” And he
                    said, I remember this vividly, “If they let the Shah back in the country for
                    medical treatment, I'm dead!” That's exactly what he said.</p>
                <p>Well, you know how these things are. When you're nominated, it's kept very quiet
                    until agr�ment is received from the country to which you're going, and then
                    there's the Senate hearing and all of this kind of thing. The announcement is
                    not made until agr�ment has been reached. Then you have the Senate hearing. So
                    for the next month we couldn't say anything to anybody. We had to go on as
                    though life were normal.</p>
                <p>About a month after this call, we were down in Matadi, which is the only seaport
                    in Zaire, where there was a flour mill called the Medima mill. They imported
                    American wheat and made it into flour, and the ten-thousandth bag, or something,
                    of flour was coming out of the mill and the ambassador was asked to come down
                    for a little ceremony to commemorate this event, so down we went. We were housed
                    in a rusty, old freighter that was bobbing around in the harbor in Matadi. Then,
                    over the Voice of America that night came the announcement that Walter Cutler
                    had been named ambassador to Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>CUTLER: So back we went to Kinshasa, and we made very short order of our
                    departure and in no time at all — I think it was a week — we were out there. We
                    said goodbye to everybody and we were gone. This was some time in May of '79. We
                    came back to Washington.</p>
                <p>At that time, I had begun to feel that it was time for Walt and me to take a
                    break from each other, that maybe we needed time away. I was not happy, and I
                    didn't think he was happy either. So this, in a way, was heaven sent because I
                    couldn't go to Iran with him — they weren't sending dependents — and he was
                    determined to go, and you can be sure that any FSO named ambassador to Iran at
                    that time in history would have given his right leg to go out there, and I
                    understand that. So that's when I said I was going to take up residence in
                    Boston. Both kids were then in schools in Massachusetts. Allen was at Amherst,
                    and Thomas was at Middlesex. And that's what we did.</p>
                <p>So we came back, and I went to Boston and rented a little place in Bay Village,
                    an apartment, and spent a horrible summer there trying to figure out what I
                    should do and how I should do it and making lists and reasons to do it and
                    reasons not to do it and crying a lot and it was an awful summer.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, Walt was down here in Washington going through the Senate
                    confirmation hearings. He was unanimously confirmed in a hurry and praised for
                    his courage. Off went his personal effects to Tehran.</p>
                <p>One Sunday afternoon, I was visiting a friend, an old friend from Korean days who
                    lived now in Wellesley. My mother called me from Asheville, North Carolina. I
                    guess she knew I was in Wellesley that afternoon. She said that my father's
                    cousin, who was then in her eighties, had been listening to the radio and had
                    heard a Reuters report that Khomeini had rejected the nominee for American
                    ambassador to Tehran. So I immediately called the Boston radio station and asked
                    if they had heard anything about this, and they said they didn't know anything
                    about it. And I said, “Well, look at your Reuter's ticker.” And he came back to
                    the phone, and said, “It's just coming off the ticker right now.”</p>
                <p>So then I put in a call to Walt in Washington. He, for reasons I don't remember
                    now, was out house-hunting. I guess we were going to sell our house in Virginia
                    and buy one in town. I left a message, and he called me back, and I said, “Walt,
                    what do you know about this?” He said, “I don't know a damned thing.” And I
                    said, “Well, why don't you call the State Department?” That's how he found out
                    that this whole thing was unraveling.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>What we think happened, and nobody knows, is that Jacob Javits, who was then a
                    senator, had passed a resolution in the Senate condemning Khomeini for the
                    execution of the Jewish leader in Tehran. That had infuriated Khomeini, who felt
                    that this was inappropriate interference in his domestic affairs. But there's
                    also some feeling that there were several people in this country, in academia,
                    who had been very much involved with Khomeini when he was exiled in France and
                    were very sympathetic — they were anti-Shah, sympathetic with Khomeini — and
                    that one or both of these people had felt that when the time came, they were the
                    appropriate nominees.</p>
                <p>Later on, additional information from Khomeini was that Walt was too closely
                    associated with anti-revolutionary regimes, having served in Vietnam during the
                    war and in Korea and in Zaire with Mobutu. Of course, this is ridiculous. The
                    ambassador represents the country's policy. He doesn't represent or stand for
                    the regime of the country to which he is assigned, but Khomeini had bought this
                    argument. Well, the State Department's and the White House's reaction to this
                    was, “You take Cutler or you don't get an ambassador.” So, for the entire
                    summer, this thing was in limbo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were in limbo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I'm in limbo. The kids are in limbo. Allen describes that summer as the
                    summer when we were Vietnamese boat people. They had no home anywhere. The boys
                    were sort of floating, staying with friends, staying here and there because we
                    had no ... We were nowhere. In the fall, the White House finally capitulated and
                    sent Bruce Laingen out as charg�, and we all know what happened to Bruce
                    Laingen. The rest is history.</p>
                <p>The sorry part about that is that a number of people who'd served with Walt in
                    other posts had volunteered to go out there with him, and they had arrived in
                    time to be taken hostage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: So a number of the hostages were people we'd known in other posts. That
                    made the hostage situation a lot closer than it might otherwise have been to
                    us.</p>
                <p>Getting Walt's things back from Tehran was a trick. They kept saying, “We won't
                    turn them over to anybody but the amb ... but the diplomat, personally.” And we
                    kept saying, “But the diplomat personally is not coming because you won't let
                    him.” It was again a kind of an Algerian phone company story, but we did finally
                    get his clothes and his squash racket and his photographs and so on back.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>At that point then he was named, I guess, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for
                    Congressional Relations, which was not his favorite post in the Foreign Service.
                    I, of course, packed up in Boston and came back to Washington because this whole
                    thing had fallen apart. Meanwhile, he'd dismissed the renters from our house in
                    Alexandria during the time when interest rates were eighteen percent, and the
                    house took forever to sell. We had bought a new house and we were paying high
                    interest rates, and we still had a mortgage on the empty house in Virginia. It
                    was a mess. So I came back and stayed in Washington with him for a year in the
                    new house, and I went to work to help supplement our income. When the Alexandria
                    house sold, I moved out. We were divorced in July of 1981. I left Washington
                    shortly after that and went to Boston.</p>
                <p>And then my next life began, and that's another chapter. But my story of the
                    Foreign Service is not complete without an account of Mama Mobutu's funeral, and
                    that may just have to wait until we get together another time because they're
                    closing up here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think they close at five, don't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I don't know. It's up to you. Do you want me to tell a little bit about
                    that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's so good. Well, I'm going to watch this [tape
                        recorder] because I realize what is happening is that when it gets to the
                        end, instead of forwarding like it should, it rewound. So I think what we
                        wiped out ... I think what it wiped out was the very first part about
                        Cameroon.</hi>

                <p>CUTLER: We'll find out when I look at it. Anyway, “Mama” was the way Mobutu's
                    wife was popularly known there. She was Mama. I think she died of exhaustion
                    from repeated childbearing. I think she had eighteen pregnancies, and she was in
                    her mid-thirties when she died. She died of a heart attack, and I can well
                    understand it. He wasn't the nicest person to be involved with because he had
                    lots of other women on the side.</p>
                <p>After she died, the diplomatic corps was summoned to file around her coffin,
                    which was lying in state in the parliament in Kinshasa. It was a boiling hot day
                    on the Equator, and we stood in line forever. Finally, I got to the head of the
                    coffin which had a glass over her face, and there she lay looking very peaceful,
                    and I moved on. I suppose we all thought that she was next going to be buried,
                    and that was that.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Well, a year later, we were all summoned again to fly up to Gbadolite, which was
                    Mobutu's home village way up in northern Zaire near Chad, a wide place in the
                    jungle, for the official burial of Mama. For this purpose, representatives from
                    all foreign governments were invited. The French sent Madame Giscard d'Estaing
                    and the Belgians sent Princess Paola, and the Carter administration sent two
                    women who were on the staff of the White House. We weren't about to send
                    Rosalynn Carter over for this. Emperor Bokassa, at that time self-proclaimed
                    emperor of the Central African Empire, now reverted to Republic — it's no longer
                    an empire and he's gone — came with his Romanian ballet dancer bride. She'd been
                    part of a visiting troupe of Romanian ballet dancers who'd come out on a
                    cultural visit to the Central African Empire, and he had taken a shine to her.
                    The story was that the Romanian government presented her to him as a gift. Well,
                    I'll tell you something, she didn't get any prize.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: He was the one who beat school children to death because they wore the
                    wrong school uniforms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that's right. That's right. He was crazy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: But he was there with his girl and so on. All of us diplomats,
                    ambassadors, who had representatives, went up in advance on a plane, a huge
                    plane that was loaded to the gunwales. We were just chugging through the air.
                    People were practically standing in the plane. We landed on an unpaved air strip
                    on laterite soil and the dust flew up in clouds. We were all pitched backwards
                    in the plane by the suddenness of the stop, but we got there alive.</p>
                <p>We got out of the plane, and a red Mercedes convertible came rushing up with
                    Mobutu at the wheel. He spotted Walt and me, and he said, “Come, get in the car
                    and I'll drive you to your lodgings.” We were about to get in the car when
                    another plane landed with Ahidjo, president of Cameroon, whom we had known in
                    the Cameroon way back in the fifties. He'd been president forever. Of course, he
                    was a head of state and Mobutu had to greet him, and we ended up being driven in
                    one of the fleet of Mercedes that had somehow been delivered clear up there. We
                    were driven off to what looked to me like a motel, which had been built ... All
                    of this had been built for this ceremony: guest houses, cathedral, an enormous
                    residence for Mobutu with marble floors and everything you could imagine. The
                    cathedral had been built by Italian masons of marble imported from Italy. He had
                    created a shining city in the jungle!</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>We walked into our room, and I first took a look at the bathroom. We each were
                    assigned a houseboy as we called them then. The tub had about three inches of
                    heavily-sedimented still water in it. I turned to this fellow, and I said, in
                    French, “Is there a problem with the water here?” And he said, “Oh, no, no,” —
                    typical African answer — “Pas de probl�me.” You know, it's always pas de
                    probl�me. There was never a problem. Well, I knew enough to know that pas de
                    probl�me was not a credible answer, so I said to Walt, “Give him every Zaire” —
                    that's the name of their currency — “you have and ask him to buy every bottle of
                    bottled water he can find in this village. Right now, this minute!” I could have
                    retired on the sale of that water if I'd been inclined to sell it, and lived
                    high on the hog for the rest of my life because, in fact, there was no running
                    water and there had been no running water for several days.</p>
                <p>We went to lunch that day in a very grand restaurant with Baccarat crystal and
                    Christoffle silverware and grapes and strawberries imported from South Africa
                    and caviar and pat� de fois gras from France, and it was ... And wines of the
                    finest vintages and French waiters. I said to one of the waiters, “Is there a
                    problem with the water here?” He said, “A problem? We haven't had any water here
                    for three days!” Well, we had water, not all that we needed, but more than
                    most.</p>
                <p>It was hotter than hell there, and, of course, mourning costume was expected, and
                    people had to shave, flush the toilets, wash their faces, and take baths, and so
                    on. I hate to think what they were doing with the dishes and the glasses and the
                    silverware.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was my first thought. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I didn't even want to know. Of course, we didn't know in those days that
                    this was the country where AIDS is supposed to have originated, so, God knows,
                    what we didn't know was good for us.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the first thing we had to do was go over to a little church, a chapel,
                    again to pay our final respects. These were our final final respects to Mama
                    Mobutu. This was televised for replay in Kinshasa on the single television
                    channel which always opened its one or two programs a day with a screen filled
                    with clouds. There'd be a tiny pinpoint in the cloud, which would grow and grow
                    and there would be the shining face of President Mobutu in his leopard-skin hat.
                    That was the way all programs opened.</p>
                <p>Anyway, this was being televised. Well, my friends who were watching back in
                    Zaire claim that the expression on my face was one of amazement when I rounded
                    the top of that coffin and there she lay, looking exactly the way she'd looked
                    when I'd seen her a year before. And this is in the tropics! There was some
                    condensation on the glass in that coffin, and I am convinced that she had been
                    deep-frozen for a year and she was thawing as we watched.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>(Interruption)</p>
                <p>The next day a load of ambassadors who did not have representatives from home was
                    flown up. They arrived at midday, just in time to fall in step behind the
                    caisson that was transporting Mama to the cathedral where the ceremony was going
                    to take place. It was boiling hot. The road was not paved. The caisson moved
                    along at the rate of about a quarter of a mile an hour. Ambassadors and their
                    wives were falling by the wayside from heat stroke.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, we're all seated in the cathedral where it was pretty hot, but at
                    least we didn't have direct sun on our heads. The next thing I know, my friend,
                    the Swedish ambassador's wife, comes alongside me. She's one who's just arrived
                    and has made the walk, and she was a sight. Her hair was hanging in damp
                    ringlets down the side of her face. Her eye make-up had run down her cheeks. She
                    just looked exhausted. Under her breath she said to me, “Some of us had to
                    walk!” Well, that hit my funny bone. So, of course, I am sitting there trying
                    not to laugh during this somber event, and she, of course, thought it was funny,
                    too.</p>
                <p>Afterwards, when we finally got through the endless mass, with all sorts of
                    monkey tails and incense being waved in the air, there was a buffet. Now you
                    have been to diplomatic buffets, and I need not remind you that they are barely
                    controlled chaos. You would think that diplomats attending a buffet had been
                    fasting for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of them have. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: The struggle to get to that buffet table was simply unbelievable, and I
                    just gave up. Not my friend, Ingrid, the Swedish Ambassador's wife. Next thing I
                    know, she arrives at our table with plates up her arms like a short-order
                    waitress at a diner, and they're loaded with food! She said, “This is a trick I
                    learned in Warsaw. What you do is you just gently press the heel of your shoe —
                    in those days we wore heels — into the toe of the person standing in front to
                    you. And you say, 'Oh, excuse me,' and then you jump ahead. That person steps
                    back, and you just move on in.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: “Before you know it, you're there.” So that was her trick.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>We had come up on the overloaded plane, and I think Walt felt that maybe it was
                    better judgment for us to go back on the embassy plane, which he was entitled to
                    use. So a summons was sent and the embassy plane came. I think it was an
                    eight-seater or something like that. There was another opportunity I lost to
                    retire in style. We could have sold seats on that plane for millions, among them
                    one to — what's his name? — Tempelsman, Maurice Tempelsman, who was Jackie
                    Kennedy's paramour at the end of her life, a great diamond merchant in Africa.
                    He did, in fact, get on the plane with us. So we flew back on that plane and
                    arrived safely at the other end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he didn't give you a diamond?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: He didn't give me a diamond. But it was really just the most bizarre
                    experience I ever had in the Foreign Service, and I had a Foreign Service full
                    of bizarre experiences. I've forgotten many of them, and it would take longer
                    than you and I have for me to recount them, but that really took the cake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I have a story about Mobutu. The background is this. Every day when I
                    drove to TASOK I passed a caged lion. The lion was growing thinner and thinner
                    as time went on. Probably the meat he was supposed to get was going home with
                    the attendant, who needed it even more. So one day I paid a call on Mobutu's
                    aide-de-camp, a Belgian officer, and made a plea on behalf of the lion. He
                    probably thought I was nuts! Nothing came of it.</p>
                <p>When we left, Mobutu invited us for a farewell dinner. I was seated at his right.
                    He turned to me and said, “Ever since your husband arrived, he's been after me
                    about human rights. And now you're carrying on about lion's rights!” He said it
                    with a smile. He was a charming rogue.</p>
                <p>As I look back, I have no regrets. I am delighted that we served in the posts
                    that we served in. I am glad we didn't go to all the flesh-pots of Europe. I
                    never would have lived in the places I lived in or spent any time or even
                    visited the places that we lived in unless we'd been in the Foreign Service. I
                    can go to London, Paris, Rome any day of the week, but to live in places like
                    Kinshasa and Algiers and Tabriz was a wonderful experience. I am very grateful
                    that I had it.</p>
                <p>I feel totally divorced from the Foreign Service now, except for the friends we
                    made, and I see them. But I am not involved in any way in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>I never felt that Foreign Service wives should be paid — and there I was
                    obviously out of step — because I felt that I did what I did as any wife in
                    those days would do as part of ... That was my deal. He made a living, and I did
                    the business entertaining, and that was the deal.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you would have done the same thing if you had been a
                        corporate wife.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: If he'd been with IBM or he'd been a lawyer or whatever, that's what, in
                    those days, I would have done. Furthermore, I felt very strongly that if I give
                    a dinner party because it is my part of the bargain, that is one thing. If you
                    pay me to give that dinner party, I become a caterer. I'm not a caterer. I don't
                    want to be paid to be a caterer. I don't want to be paid to be a hotelier. I'm
                    not for hire.</p>
                <p>I did feel, and I'm going to put this on the tape because I want it there for the
                    record, that something equivalent to the GI Bill should have been offered to
                    Foreign Service wives for two reasons: it was a way of acknowledging what you
                    had done for no pay, and with marriages in the Foreign Service frequently ending
                    badly or with education and careers disrupted, it would have been an opportunity
                    for women to complete their education, polish up skills, or learn, new,
                    marketable skills so that they could reenter the job market and be
                    self-supporting. I never understood why that idea never, as far as I know, even
                    had a hearing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: There may have been a problem because it might have been felt that if you
                    extend this to Foreign Service wives, you'd have to extend it to military wives;
                    but, after all, why shouldn't military wives who've served abroad be
                    acknowledged and compensated in exactly the same way?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: We were performing, in effect, an unpaid service for the federal
                    government. The fact that up until the seventies we were a part of the regular
                    inspection process and our performance was evaluated as part of the husband's
                    report says to me that, except for acknowledging us with any kind of
                    compensation, we were considered part of the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>It could work like this. If you served X years abroad where you were not able or
                    equipped to hold a job, develop job skills, or continue your education, then
                    each of those years would translate into X number of credits towards education.
                    That would have been not just for Foreign Service, but for any government wife,
                    military or otherwise, who served abroad and performed the kinds of functions we
                    performed. That would have been ideal.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I think if they had done that sooner, then they
                        wouldn't have been faced with the necessity for the '72 Directive, which
                        just cut us off, as far as some women were concerned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: That's right because by then the women's movement was in full stride and
                    women justifiably were saying, “Wait just a minute here!” You've come out of
                    this experience, if you are like me, divorced. You have no Social Security, no
                    resume, no pension. Now they did change that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Now you're entitled to part of the pension, and, of course, that was too
                    ... I didn't get that. I waived it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you waived it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I waived it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Because I was going to say, you're entitled to
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I waived it. I was entitled to it, but I waived it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that was nice of you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: No, it wasn't. It was stupid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought you were being nice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, I was being nice, but, you know, sometimes you can be nice and be
                    stupid in the bargain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I can't imagine you making a decision like that, in
                        that case. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, I did. But, as I say, I wouldn't trade my Foreign Service life for
                    anything. I think as far as my children are concerned, it was a wonderful
                    experience.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they came out well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: They seem to have survived unscathed. Who knows? Maybe they'll spend the
                    rest of their lives on psychiatrists' couches!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it seems to me exactly like another person I
                        interviewed who had the same kind of positive experience said it was just
                        her husband was a wonderful Foreign Service Officer, but the qualities that
                        made him a marvelous Foreign Service Officer — and he has gone on as Walt
                        has to ambassadorships and assistant secretaries — made him a terrible
                        husband, not a terrible, terrible husband.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, I have to say Walt was not a terrible husband.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wasn't terrible. It's just that she felt there was
                        nothing there between them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Well, I felt that our relationship was more like two business
                    partners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: You know, it wasn't ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think maybe that's how she felt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: It was as though we were equals in business, but there was nothing more
                    there. I think Walt was a superbly good Foreign Service Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think he was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: I'm very proud of his achievements. When he had time for it, he was a
                    wonderful, patient father. But his career was very important to him. That is not
                    very different from an awful lot of men in many other professions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>CUTLER: Many of these men go on to marry a much younger woman after their first
                    marriage, and you'll hear them say, “I have young children and now I have time
                    to spend with them. I wish I could have done this ... “</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before. Yes, yes, “if only I had had that time with with
                        my first children!”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: How often have you heard or read that? I'm not saying that he neglected
                    his children. I think he was, is an important presence in their lives. But
                    obviously, the fact that he went to Vietnam and that he was willing to go when
                    called to Cambodia and all of these things ... The message is clear that, you
                    know, “My career ... “ Well, it was our way of life, too. So, in a way, he
                    probably thought, with justification, this is how I make my living, and the
                    better I am at it, the better living I make, so this is the trade-off.</p>
                <p>He was lucky in a way to have me as a partner because I am a pretty
                    self-sufficient person. I don't have a lot of self-pity. I coped. But I reached
                    a point where I thought it's now or never. Either I've got to get out while
                    there's still a chance for each of us to find happiness with someone else, or
                    happiness alone, or it's going to be too late. I think he would agree that I did
                    him a favor. I really do. He's married again, well. I think it's a happy
                    marriage. She's an ideal wife for him. I like her. Walt and I are friendly. We
                    don't see each other very much, but we don't ... It's not a cold war. It never
                    was. I guess if it had to happen, it was as easily accomplished as anything like
                    that can be, but never without terrible regrets for the fact of a divorce.</p>
                <p>I'll never get over that. To have done that to my children, though they don't
                    seem to harbor any resentment. I just feel you interrupt their history. You
                    create awkwardness in their lives. I regret that very much. I wish I hadn't felt
                    driven to do it, but I did.</p>
                <p>My life since has been extraordinarily interesting and full. I had a brief and
                    happy marriage the second time. My time as the director of a residential
                    therapeutic program for troubled adolescents in Florida was a learning
                    experience, in spades. I'd never had any contact with that kind of problem. So
                    the opportunities that came to me after the Foreign Service were rich and
                    fulfilling.</p>
                <p>So maybe, in a way, I've had the best of all lives. I had the period when I was
                    growing up and going to boarding school and college and doing all the things
                    that kids those days did. Then came the fascinating years in the Foreign Service
                    when the Foreign Service was still fascinating — and those outposts were still
                    really outposts and you didn't have wraparound services and you didn't have a
                    Family Liaison Office and you didn't have a CLO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you didn't have the internet.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>CUTLER: You didn't have the internet. Then from there to the world of work where
                    I proved that I could support myself and do it well. Then a happy marriage cut
                    short by Mike's premature death from brain cancer. And now my fifth life is
                    unfolding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fifth life, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: We'll see. So I have to say that I can't whine about the Foreign Service.
                    I just can't whine. It did me a favor. Great!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shall I say, “End of Tape”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUTLER: Yes, say “end of tape.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
