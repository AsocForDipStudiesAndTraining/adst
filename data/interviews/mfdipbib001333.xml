                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is June 24, 2002. This is an interview with Timothy
                        Michael Carney. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training. I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Let's start at
                        the beginning. When and where were you born? Tell me a bit about your
                        parents and family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I was born in St. Joseph, Missouri, July 12, 1944. My father at that time
                    was in the Army. It was World War II. My mother was the daughter of a surgeon in
                    St. Joe, a volatile, irascible kind of man, my grandfather. I have no memories
                    of him. My father's family was from Omaha, Nebraska, originally, having been
                    from Wichita, Kansas. I knew his side of the family very well. My late
                    grandfather was with Cudahy Packing Company for years and years and years. He
                    ultimately had a stroke and died at about age 65. The Army basically beckoned to
                    Dad, who after he got out and was demobilized went to law school at Creighton in
                    Omaha and then tried to make it in insurance and law and ultimately decided to
                    go back into the Army about 1948.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the Carneys come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The Gaelic is O'Kirnaugh (phonetic) from County Donegal in Ireland. The
                    transliteration into English produces either Carney or Kearney. The Carney clan
                    was based in Randolph, Massachusetts. There are 2-3 pages of us in the Boston
                    telephone directory. The branch that I'm a twig of moved off to Wichita. In
                    fact, there are some famous Carneys. About 30 years ago, two of my second
                    cousins and some of their friends were sitting around at the plant working a
                    half day shift on Saturday and wanted to get out and go hunting in the
                    afternoopheasants beckoneand one of them said, “It's a shame there's no place
                    where we could just grab a hamburger and maybe get us a soft drink or a beer and
                    get on out.” “Maybe we can do something about that.” So they started a little
                    business they called Pizza Hut. These are the rich Carneys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your father go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>CARNEY: He did. He was the first one in the family actually to get a degree. It
                    was from Creighton. My late uncle, John, also went to college but I don't
                    believe he ever finished. My mother also was a college graduate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll talk about her side in a minute. Had your father
                        graduated from college by the time he went into the Army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: That's a good question. I'm not sure I have the answer. He went into the
                    Army in '42 and he would have been 21 or 22. So my guess is he had gotten an
                    undergraduate degree from Creighton, from which he also got his law degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he an officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Oh, no. In his World War II experience, he was in Ordnance and an
                    enlisted man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then he returned to the Army in '48?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: About then, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did he do then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: He went into the Judge Advocate Generals Corps, a far different pursuit
                    than what one watches on TV now courtesy of the Navy. He was assigned first to
                    Fort Myer. We lived at South post Fort Myer. Then almost immediately, in January
                    of 1950, he went to Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your mother's maiden name and what was their
                        background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Their background was also Irish. Whereas the Carney clan came to the U.S.
                    in the 1840s or '50s, I cannot tell you when the Byrne clan came, but it was
                    equally old. Neither my father nor my mother had the right to own property in
                    Ireland, which means their grandparents were not born in Ireland, which suggests
                    mid-19th century arrival here. I had not tracked the migration west, but
                    Grandfather Byrne wound up in St. Joe, Missouri, around the turn of the century
                    and established his medical practice there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother went where to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>CARNEY: She went to Duchesne in Omaha, where she and my father met.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you start going to school as a boy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: My earliest memories of school are in Bad Tolz in Germany. Dad was with
                    the First Infantry Division, one of the elements of the U.S. occupation of
                    Germany, the last 3 or 4 years. I started in kindergarten and then moved through
                    various U.S. military schools in the 3 years we were in Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the schools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I don't have any memory of those schools at all except the torture of
                    trying to learn penmanship as a left hander.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they still saying that you had to do it with the
                        right hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, but they wanted us to shape letters the same way as right handers do.
                    If you do that, you have the paper tilted the wrong way in such a fashion that
                    you tend to smear what you've written with your left hand crossing over it.
                    That's basically where a lot of left handers get that peculiar cramp and top
                    down style of holding their pens or pencils.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess that's gone out the window for some time now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Oh, yes. In fact, it wasn't until I got to college that I actually turned
                    the paper around the other way and began to write with a backhanded slant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the German stint, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Dad was assigned to Fort Bliss, Texas, so there we were in hot and dusty
                    Fort Bliss next to El Paso.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Texas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I have very little memory of it except that it was hot and dusty. We did
                    go off to White Sands Proving Grounds for a fire power demonstration.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you were interested in sports or
                        reading?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was probably at Fort Bliss where I have my most vivid memories of
                    getting interested in reading. I was about 10 and I began reading a whole set of
                    boyhood adventure novels written by that stable of authors, one of whom was
                    Millicent Benson, also known as Carolyn Keene. My sister was reading her Nancy
                    Drew adventure stories. I started reading Tom Swift, Jr. He was more the Flying
                    Lab and things like that. Tom Swift, Sr., a turn of the last century set of
                    novels for boys were by Victor Appleton, who I guess, also was a construct? I
                    finally 4 or 5 years later came across some of those in one of my relatives'
                    libraries and found them delightful, too. Rick Brant Electronic Adventures. Then
                    there was a third series as well: Tom Corbett: Space Cadet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this attract to you to the scientific world or was
                        this a reading exercise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was basically the impulse for the college I chose to attend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you moved along, where did you go to high
                        school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Various. If you count junior high school, I was in the 7th and 8th grades
                    in Taipei, Taiwan, the Taipei American School, and then started 9th grade in
                    Junction City, Kansas, right next to Fort Riley. I spent 2 years there. Then my
                    last 2 years were at Christian Brothers High School in St. Joseph, Missouri.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were you in Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: About 12.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the Far East?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>CARNEY: I did. I was fascinated by it. I liked the food. Chopsticks provided no
                    challenge even left handed, although the Chinese were a little appalled from
                    time to time to see someone actually using their chopsticks in the left hand.
                    Incredibly green, lush. People were poor. There were an incredible number of
                    peasants in Taiwan. There was a history that I was old enough to be aware of: of
                    the ruthless men in Nationalist Chinese occupation of Taiwan following the
                    communist victory in 1949. Our houseboy at the time had invited us over to his
                    house in Tamshui and we went and met his family and enjoyed the Taiwanese
                    version of Chinese food. Yes, it sparked an interest in the Far East as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find being an Army brat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I loved it. I didn't mind the travel. I don't seem to have had any
                    trouble making the relatively few friends that I ever hung out with as a preteen
                    and teenager. It bothered my brother and sister a good bit having to cut the
                    ties and then forge them anew whenever we moved. We moved very frequently: 10
                    elementary schools and 2 high schools. In that sense, the Foreign Service was
                    almost sedentary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on it, did you find that the military
                        education, moving from place to place, do you think you came out ahead or
                        behind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Probably high school was the most crucial period on the education side,
                    and I was behind, but that was the result of the parochial schools that I
                    attended in my 4 years of high school rather than military schools. I think if
                    you look at education, certainly up until high school, if a child reads, you
                    just expand his or her horizons enormously by trying to guide that reading
                    insofar as a parent can.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At home were current events or literature discussed around
                        the dinner table?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No. I don't believe so to the best of my recollection? There was a good
                    bit of discussion on grammar and vocabulary and the use of language, which is
                    very American, as we Americans became more broadly literate. It's almost like
                    etiquette. But on issues, I don't recall much discussion of the issues of the
                    time. The Kennedy presidency was quite hotly discussed around the house, the
                    family being Roman Catholic by background. Other than that, certain foreign
                    affairs issuecorruption in Taiwan, for example. There was a murder case my
                    father was involved in, in his capacity with JAG on Taiwan and then subsequent
                    riots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the one where they sacked the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes. It was in '57.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a major incident in American-Taiwanese
                        relations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: And it was understood as such by even someone as young as I. We lived in
                    Peitou, which has always amused people who know Taiwan since it's known for its
                    sulfur baths and houses of ill repute. At 12, I was intellectually curious but
                    not particularly interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about some of the kids who were 14 and 15? I think
                        being tossed into that sort of environment would make it either an education
                        or a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was both. I was in the 8th grade. I was 13. The word circulated that
                    some of my classmates had contracted VD of one form or another and weren't shy
                    about flaunting it. It was a strange hothouse kind of a place. The group that I
                    hung around with, the few of us who lived in Peitou, because we were not in the
                    housing area of Tianmu or Yang Min Shan, we would sneak out and buy $30 worth of
                    firecrackers. We would wander off to friend's houses or a hotel known for its
                    nighttime hobby and put a cigarette through one end of the fuse and then wander
                    away and see the result, all this at about midnight. Things that would just
                    shock and horrify me now. Very good spirits but nevertheless aspects of ugly
                    American to it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your family orthodox Catholic or lax Catholic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Churchgoing, but I didn't get a background feel for very? Not deeply into
                    the devotional side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to parochial high schools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, but that was solely a function of having been in the States at the
                    time and the fact that my father was in Korea for my last two years of high
                    school. His was not an accompanied tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the school and who ran it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The first one was run by nuns of no great intellectual capacity in
                    Junction City, Kansas. They might have been Benedictine sisters. They were not
                    up to running a modern high school. There were only 140 in the whole high
                    school. Of course, I didn't realize this at the time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You think of nuns running the more elementary schools
                        where the fathers take over at the high school level, at least for guys sort

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Then the Brothers were very good at that in my second school, which was
                    not coed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In high school, was there anything that particularly
                        engaged you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Not sports. I've never been particularly active in sports, although I did
                    play Pony League hardball in Taiwan - a confusion of left handed and right
                    handedness. I throw right handed but I am left handed and my left eye is
                    dominant, which means you can't possible realize your potential if you're in
                    that kind of a peculiar arrangement.</p>
                <p>I did develop photography and ultimately became the yearbook photographer as well
                    as editor and thoroughly enjoyed that. That came largely out of a Fort Riley
                    experience when a bad boy was sent down to live with his uncle, presumably
                    because of the belief that the military family is run on military discipline. He
                    taught me darkroom techniques and I acquired a decent camera then and began a
                    hobby that has continued lifelong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from high school in what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: '62. The movie “Where Were You in '62” rang a lot of bells.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the military attract you at all as a career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It didn't. My father had great hopes that I'd go to West Point, largely
                    for the finances of it, but I wasn't interested.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was the only school I wanted to go to, and the only one to which I
                    applied. This came from my readings in the adventure novels.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Now it would be impossible. In those days, it wasn't easy, but I
                    succeeded.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go to MIT from '62 to '66?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about MIT. What was it like when you
                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: We drove up from Atlanta, where my father was stationed at Fort
                    McPherson. He had an old friend in the Boston area. We went out to dinner and
                    got me installed in the dormitory, which at the time was by the great Finnish
                    architect Alvar Aalto, his only building in the United States, Baker House,
                    serpentine, located on Memorial Drive in Cambridge. I had two roommates. I was
                    in a triple. There was a housing crunch among undergraduates at the Institute. I
                    didn't want to join a fraternity, although I did go to some of the rush? I
                    certainly didn't have enough money to consider a fraternity. At that time, MIT
                    was about $1,500.00 tuition a year and a year's education would have been about
                    $3,000, which seemed like a lot of money. I owed around $10,000 by the time I
                    graduated and ultimately joined the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you were competing with kids from Bronx
                        High School of Science? Some really first rate institutions at the high
                        school level were kicking their kids there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I was extremely deficient in science and, especially, math as a result of
                    both my own education and, I ultimately came to realize, as a result of my own
                    lack of talent. The talent just simply hadn't been explored and I did not have
                    the abilities in math and science to think of the careers in those fields that I
                    had thought I was so interested in. So I tease my Foreign Service colleagues
                    that basically I failed my first physics course at MIT. I said, “Well, you know,
                    you fail the sciences, you go to diplomacy.”</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Q: Many people I've talked to have embarked on an engineering or a medical or a
                    science course and after the first couple semesters have found that this was not
                    for them and moved elsewhere. But being at MIT, there is nowhere else to go
                    within the school, or was there?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: That's just it. Partly I'm stubborn, comes with the Irish extraction. And
                    partly if you looked at MIT even in those days, there was an enormously capable
                    and well respected department of political science. There was also a terrific
                    economics faculty. Paul Samuelson was teaching the basic course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Generation after generation grew up on Samuelson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Exactly. He wrote the basic textbook.</p>
                <p>There was also a growing, but of no reputation, humanities department. Everything
                    at MIT is numbers and all the courses have numbers. When MIT people get
                    together, you basically talk numbers. “What course were you?” “I was 6. What
                    were you?” “I was 21,” talking electrical engineering versus humanities. The
                    humanities department was divided into history, literature, and philosophy. The
                    area that MIT is much better known for is linguistics. Noam Chomsky was there.
                    But that was an entirely separately department, 23. I cascaded from physics to
                    biology and tried to make up and get a leg up on the biology side by taking at
                    Harvard summer school a year's worth of physical chemistry. I just simply wasn't
                    any good at that either. You didn't have to be a modern biologist to realize,
                    even in 1963 or '64, that modern biology would require every single element of
                    the panoply of modern mathematics and modern physics. I just simply didn't think
                    I had the mathematical capability to handle all of that, so I dropped in my
                    junior year into history with biology as a science minor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to find mature people to talk to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No. Never did. Partly that's my own character.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure that these schools were that well equipped. I
                        suppose they were there if you really wanted to go out and do it. In my time
                        in college, I never really talked to an adult about where I was going.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Mentor? There was no concept. There was a bit of it with upperclassmen
                    but at MIT the upperclassmen were all in engineering or science for the most
                    part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel like a fish out of water at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>CARNEY: No, I was regarded as a little strange, but there was a niche for people
                    doing humanities as well. There must have been 20-30 of us who graduated in '66
                    in humanities and science or humanities and engineering, which is what the
                    degree is called.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular element of history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Many of the courses were taught by visiting professors. The history
                    faculty at MIT was weak, but had someone of reputation who had jointly written a
                    book, China, Japan and the West. He was also a Cambridge City Councilman. The
                    visiting professors were very impressive: A woman anthropologist from Wellesley;
                    and an extremely solid anthropologist from Yale. Some younger lecturer rather
                    than professor types from Harvard, who mainly focused on anthropology and Asian
                    history. The Asian history is what led me, along with the issues of the day, to
                    my first post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you keeping in mind? Had Taipei embedded itself as
                        far as a place of interest in the Far East?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The Far East was of interest and I had experience there. I had also met
                    my first Foreign Service person there. As one of the scholars from the 8th
                    grade, I was among the ushers at the high school graduation. I recall ushering
                    the ambassador's wife to her seat. That stuck with me as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at MIT, you had the Cuban Missile Crisis
                        and Kennedy's assassination and the Cold War and all. Did this intrude
                        much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I took more history courses and only one political science course, Lucien
                    Pye's graduate course in Asian political systems. As noted, one of the history
                    courses I took from a professor whom I still, to this day, admire was also on
                    China, Japan, and the West. So, the focus, anthropology, political science, and
                    history, was the Far East.</p>
                <p>The issues were the Kennedy assassination, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and a number
                    of the events of the period, including Vietnam to a small degree and mainly with
                    anti-war activists. All got discussion in the dormitory, but not much because
                    the focus was so heavily on science and engineering and everybody was working
                    like dogs. The Institute was never an Ivy League party school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you meet the Harvard types? Was this a different
                        world?</hi>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>CARNEY: It was a different world. At the 25th alumni reunion, my wife and I were
                    with a group of friends who have stayed togethewe were in Baker House from
                    freshman year on and we've kept in toucand we were at the black tie dinner
                    concluding the events. My wife said, “You know, you all so clearly enjoy each
                    other's company. You must have had a great time at MIT.” The table went dead
                    quiet. Finally, Stu Shapiro, who is in New York as head of the computer science
                    department at the University there in Buffalo, said, “You know, no, we didn't
                    have a good time. I certainly didn't. I graduated 2nd in my class of 800 high
                    school students. I got to MIT and I could hardly get out of the bottom quarter
                    of the class, and I worked all the time. No, it wasn't fun.” There were good
                    times, but it simply wasn't fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it can be a little like basic training. You remember
                        some of the people you were with through basic training but it's not

                <p>CARNEY: Exactly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to enjoy the delights of Boston at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: To a degree, but largely because I tended to stay over holiday periods
                    and over the summers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your father's family was away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I didn't find being at home that congenial after I got old enough to
                    think for myself. My parents were in the process that led to a divorce when I
                    was about 20 years old.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very difficult. Was your father of a military mind

                <p>CARNEY: No. As we all look at the various modern attempts to determine character,

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: He was not all that pleased when I chose the Foreign Service. He thought
                    that I was leading him along and I had joined the CIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were getting close to graduation with a history
                        major, what was in the offing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I thought about graduate school. I applied to Brandeis but not with any
                    great enthusiasm. I also looked at how much money I owed and knew I'd have to
                    borrow more to do graduate school and couldn't and wouldn't depend on the
                    family. It seemed to me that getting a job was a better idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A debt of $10,000 in those days was just
                        overwhelming.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Even though it was mainly that federal loan program at 1.25%
                    interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But still, just to pay it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Exactly. In those days, that was more than the annual salary of an
                    incoming junior officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I took the Foreign Service written exam with about 24 other people from
                    MIT and passed it. Then did the oral down at USUN in New York and passed that.
                    Of course, it was the time of the buildup of the Foreign Service for Vietnam.
                    That's why I passed. The passing mark is always a function of intake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall how the oral exam went for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>CARNEY: It was 3 balding portlies. It was the old style oral. It was essentially
                    a set of questions such as, “If your ship starts in Seattle and goes through the
                    Panama Canal to New York, what do you pick up and what do you offload at each
                    port?” That might have been someone else's question. One that I recall is, “You
                    are advising a foreigner on tourism in the United States and he wants to know
                    about interesting and great homes in America to visit. Where would you send
                    him?” The last question: “Suppose the U.S. had not made the Louisiana Purchase.
                    Trace the course of history of the U.S. and Europe thereafter.” I found that
                    fascinating. I ultimately had us at war with Great Britain over what would
                    become the west of the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had Vietnam really crossed your radar much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Absolutely. There were marches. There was an anti-war movement. Students
                    for Democratic Society were active. One of the people I knew in the dorm was
                    part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought MIT being more outside the? didn't
                        have the kids with the leisure time to go out and strike.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There was enough leisure and enough smart kids who were looking at the
                    issue that there was an active but small group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling about the Vietnam War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I didn't except to the extent that there was no question you had to
                    oppose the communists wherever you could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came into the Foreign Service in 1966?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No. I passed the test and got on the rank order register but asked to
                    delay it for a year. My mother was then married to a fellow who worked for
                    Volkswagen, and Volkswagen of America had scholarships to study abroad for
                    employees. I won several thousand dollars and went off to France for an academic
                    year, delaying my entry into the Foreign Service as a result. I wanted to learn
                    French because it was the language of diplomacy, so I thought.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went there from '66-'67.</hi>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: To Grenoble, which was just gearing up to become the Winter Olympic site
                    in '68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I found all the American girls seemed to carry a block of hashish in
                    their back pocket which they would scrape into their cigarettes. That is perhaps
                    an exaggeration, but a fair number were. Grenoble was the center where many of
                    the Pieds Noirs had established themselves from Algeria. It provided an
                    interesting tone of intense political discussion and criticism of metropolitan
                    France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there a year before the student events of
                        '68.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I did not see any barricades.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the French student body a more volatile
                        crew?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I didn't have much experience with the French student body. The people
                    who didn't speak any French like me were in courses with other foreigners. I
                    gave up on the university because it had a classic language teaching classroom
                    methodology, and discovered the Institute of Phonetics where they did
                    audiovisual method, more like FSI taught when I took courses there after joining
                    the Service. But you were still with foreigners. There were relatively few
                    French students who were all that interested in foreigners except the guys
                    trying to hit on the girls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was still the time when one assumed that the French
                        would just assume any foreigner of any ilk would go away.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, the major event that I can recall in that period was the film “A
                    Man and a Woman” came out and the Ford Mustang, to the astonishment of anyone
                    who knows anything about cars, became the vehicle of choice. People couldn't buy
                    one because they were students. They fell in love with it because of that
                    film.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a great romance story and it had cars.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Did you come away with any feeling about France at all?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: I did. I liked the French approach in many ways. It is very different.
                    There are two aspects of French engineering? One struck me then and the other
                    has struck me since. One is the Citroen. What an interesting way to design a
                    car. The second is - they do the same with shotguns. The French double barrel
                    shotgun does not have a hinge pin. You don't push a lever and the barrels then
                    fall to expose the chambers. Instead, it has a breech that slides and you pull
                    up a couple of ears and slide the breech back: A unique approach to aspects of
                    engineering.</p>
                <p>I went out to the reactor near Grenoble at the French nuclear center. We were
                    standing around a heavy water reactor and I looked over into the pool. We had a
                    tour guide. There were about 12 of us looking at it. I asked him, “Isn't that
                    the Cherenkov effect down there?” This basically causes a blue color to result
                    from the absorption of? It was the first time I had seen it. Normally, I
                    wouldn't have asked anything. My French was pretty shaky at that point. He said,
                    “Yes, it is just that.” We began a discussion that was a little too hard for me
                    to follow in technical? atomic physics in French. Fascinating. So I maintain my
                    engineering interests to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Citroen was a delightful looking car with that suspension.
                        It really is one of the most beautiful cars ever designed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The DS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you come out Frenchwise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: When I joined the Foreign Service, I got a 2+ and required 8 weeks of
                    French to get me up to a 3 to get off language probation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came in in '67?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Right. June 22nd.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Describe your class.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>CARNEY: There were 72 of us, 57 State Department Foreign Service officers and 15
                    from USIA. It was a period that, I think, was later reversed when everyone was
                    regarded as a Foreign Service officer, which is what should have been forever.
                    There were a number of people in it who ultimately came to considerable
                    prominence. Ned Walker was in the class. Bob Blackwill was in the class. Bob had
                    nowhere near the drive, nor did he show the qualities that generate controversy
                    to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is ambassador to India (and subsequently returned to
                        the NSC Staff) and there have been articles who don't like his management
                        techniques.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: He's very abrasive according to what everyone says. I haven't seen enough
                    of him- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>But I haven't seen enough of Bob Blackwill to comment one way or the other. There
                    were a number of other people who ultimately became celebrities. Eleanor Hicks
                    was a black woman from Cincinnati who wound up Consul in Nice. Then she was to
                    go to Laos as number 2 and decided to leave the Service ostensibly to get
                    married, but I don't know what the real reason was. I haven't heard from her.
                    She and I stayed in touch for a number of years. In other words, it was a class
                    with far more women than is usually the case and one with a very disparate group
                    of interests. There was an MIT Ph.D. in it as well, who only lasted a tour, as
                    you might expect. A Ph.D. at the time was gross over education for the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an attitude towards Vietnam? How was that viewed
                        within the class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: That was still the period when junior officers could be assigned to
                    Vietnam. There were about 12 of us who were. Only 2 of us volunteered, me and
                    John Forbes. John's father was then commander of the 199th Light Infantry
                    brigade, which was in Vietnam during the period of our A100 course. There were 1
                    or 2 people who had been in Vietnam. Ward Thompson, who was assigned to Denmark.
                    They were not going to assign someone who had served in the military, which
                    showed good common sense. Ed Adams and Ruth McLendon were running that A100
                    course. Vietnam was intensely a focus because it was the march on the Pentagon
                    year, the summer of '67, where all the hippies and trippies went and linked
                    hands around the Pentagon together to cause it to jump up into the air and fall
                    back and collapse. My logic was, this was the single most important foreign
                    policy action and I wanted to be there to see what it's all about.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was known as “seeing the elephant.” Did you get
                        involved with organizations like JFSOC (Junior Foreign Service Officers
                        Club)? This was a time when youth was everywhere? You were a generation born
                        without original sin until you reached the age of 30 and then you were
                        beyond it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I was 22 when I came into the Service and then turned 23 shortly
                    thereafter. But I did the basic course, 8 weeks of French, and then I was in
                    Saigon on the anniversary of the Marine Corps, November 11th, 1967. So, from
                    June 22nd to mid-November was my period in Washington.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: Well, we were all FSO-8s going on Career Ambassador wandering around
                    trying to absorb as much as possible. I remember bearding George Vest about the
                    lack of utility of NATO when our group went to see him. He did chuckle and said,
                    “Why at this point, especially considering what NATO has become?” We were just
                    all over the bureaucracy looking at things, including a trip out to CIA with its
                    auditorium where the acoustics are such that nobody can hear anybody including
                    the lecturer. A question about assassinations arose from one of my classmates
                    who was particularly politically engaged. It was he who asked (Secretary of
                    State) Dean Rusk about Vietnam when he came to speak to us, noting the seeming
                    failure of our policies there.</p>

                    was in the political section which was fascinating and confirmed that that was
                    the kind of work I wanted to do. I wound up doing the airgram on the biography
                    of the newly elected Vietnamese parliament, and then following youth and student
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador and how was the political section
                        structured?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There were 80-plus people on the diplomatic list in Saigon at the head of
                    which was Ellsworth Bunker, and at the bottom of which was Timothy Carney. I
                    felt like an FSO-9. In fact, the first time I met Bunker was in the elevator,
                    which I was reluctant to board while he was in it. He just said, “Come on in.”
                    The political section had 22 or 23 “real” officers in it and a large number of
                    Agency people in what was totally nominal cover.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were their own section, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: They were all over the town. There were a lot of Agency people there.</p>
                <p>The head of the section was Tom Recknagle with Ted Heavner as his deputy and then
                    Galen Stone replaced Tom. There was an external unit and there was a
                    political-military unit and there was an internal unit and, also, a provincial
                    reporting unit. That last was an innovation for Vietnam which had a number of
                    officers with good language skills. I would have been part of the internal unit
                    doing my biography.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the national assembly's
                        caliber, of the people in it and its effectiveness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I didn't have much feel for it from the biographies I was doing. I have
                    never been brilliant at understanding things from reading about them. It was
                    only when I started to meet members of the Senate and the Assembly that I
                    realized what an inadequate group it was for South Vietnam to be dealing with
                    the threat from the North.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about doing this? Where were you getting
                        your information?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Files, and talking to my colleagues, and running pieces of paper through
                    them and that sort of thing. Then, of course, I began to develop my own
                    contacts, including teaching English to a Vietnamese Senator. More valuable to
                    understand what was going on was my work in the area of youth and student
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>It was in that latter area that I came in contact with General Lansdale's staff.
                    He had a peculiar and not very influential role at that time, in contrast to his
                    days in the 50s in the Philippines and in Vietnam. His young staffer working on
                    student matters was Charlie Sweet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find your French useful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Not until I moved from the political section to the commercial section.
                    Then it was vital. You just had to have it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You arrived there in November of '67. What was the
                        situation like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The feeling was things were moving. There seemed to be a congealing of
                    South Vietnamese authority, and a growing capability and competence. I was in no
                    position to challenge that. All the information I was seeing seemed to support
                    it up until the Tet offensive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We move to January/February of '68. Where were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I had gone to bed at the hotel. There was such a lack of housing, I was
                    in a hotel from November until I got an apartment in April of '68. I shared that
                    apartment with another political officer. I had gone to my Vietnamese teacher's
                    house for a Tet party and had drunk entirely too much. Exceptionally, fireworks
                    were permitted for the Tet celebrations. I woke up in the morning to an enormous
                    amount of fireworks and got back to sleep and then got a call from the embassy
                    saying, “Don't come into work.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What hotel were you in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The New Saigon Hotel, which was just past the palace and the Cercle
                    Sportif.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't a short distance to the embassy. It wasn't right
                        around the corner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, it wasn't. Normally we took a bus or a shuttle.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening in the hotel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, it was full of mainly USAID people due to the circumstances of my
                    arrival and who I got hooked up with for the initial housing assignment. We were
                    basically on the roof of the hotel looking at what was going on around towair
                    strikes and firefights. A helicopter crashed on the roof of the COMNAVFORCV
                    headquarters about 3 blocks away. Bullets would go overhead, sounding just like
                    they do in the movies. Interesting stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel this was what you had been paid to do as a
                        diplomat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I knew it. There wasn't any doubt. I had no doubt that any amateur status
                    had been revoked. I was always astonished when my colleagues didn't seem to
                    grasp that in later years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any weapons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I arrived with a .32 automatic that I had bought at Interarmco in
                    Alexandria, but only recall actually wearing it two or three times in the 18
                    month tour. I had been on the freshman pistol team at the university, had hunted
                    and shot birds using a shotgun? I had respect for firearms, but certainly wasn't
                    afraid of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Viet Cong come close to your hotel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: They were on the grounds of the nearby Presidential Palace or on the
                    grounds of a hotel on the other side of the Presidential Palace, but we're
                    talking 6 or 8 blocks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you able to get back to the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Two days later. I went up and found the windows all awry in the office.
                    The rocket propelled grenades that had hit the embassy's attractive outer shell,
                    which was in fact a blast screen, had caused enough pressure to wrench the
                    window frames out of the building wall. There was a fellow in full body armor
                    and helmet with an M-16 sitting in my office from the 101sAirborne Division.
                    Those people were withdrawn within a day or two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling that the attack on the embassy was a
                        bad thing, that it had been stopped?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>CARNEY: The feeling was, it was brilliantly conceived by the Viet Cong - it was a
                    Viet Cong operation. The NVA clearly wasn't involvethat they had done their
                    best, and it wasn't good enough, that we had responded to the surprise with a
                    successful defense, but that the effect in the United States was clearly what
                    the Vietnamese communists had intended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any feel for how this was playing in the
                        United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: We would see TV and newspapers. There was no lack of information on how
                    America was looking at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling that the media was the problem or part
                        of the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There was a feeling in that way which I didn't know enough to share, and
                    wasn't going to take without knowing more about it. I met a number of
                    journalists there, some of whom I came to know, and am in contact with to this
                    day. It was clearly an odd time. I was a little puzzled as to why we didn't know
                    more about what the Viet Cong were up, to considering how many people there were
                    from the various intelligence agencieNSA, CIA, DIA - all over the town of Saigon
                    and upcountry as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the embassy seem to be either in disarray or
                        functioning or puzzled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was more or less business as usuacarry on, let's focus on what we're
                    doing. Arch Calhoun was Minister for Political Affairs there, to be replaced by
                    Martin Herz. (I don't remember when Martin Herz came in.) I only felt it at the
                    time? This is analytical, and I only felt it at the time by its absence: There
                    is no leadership in the Foreign Service. Foreign Service officers, most of them,
                    do not know how to lead even if they have the basic talent for leading. This was
                    very conspicuous by its absence. People were more or less left to cope.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is a failing but it's an attitude? Everyone
                        does their job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're lead by indirection. “It would be nice to have
                        somebody do something about such and such” and then you're somebody who's
                        supposed to go out and do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Was your bailiwick still the national assembly?</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>CARNEY: I moved to youth and student affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the students pretty quiet during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I'm not sure I can remember. I was talking with student leaders. The
                    Vietnamese in general were very good at manipulating students through their
                    leaders. The leaders were very good at grasping when they were being manipulated
                    and allowing themselves to be manipulated to the point that they could get their
                    own agenda satisfied as well. The leaders that I dealt with were very smart,
                    well connected across a range of political fronts, very active, but I didn't see
                    what they were doing that would be effective, nor did I see what their ultimate
                    goals were. One of those leaders ultimately made his way to the U.S. as a
                    refugee and got in touch with me, having changed his name to Freeman to
                    celebrate his escape from Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I noted that students were sort of against things and
                        protesting but it was pretty hard to come to say “Let's make peace with the
                        communists.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Exactly, especially after the Tet offensive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude you were getting about how the Thieu
                        government responded to the offensive and where it was going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Bunker shortly, at Washington's urging, began a set of conversations with
                    Thieu himself, as I recall, that Steve Johnson, who was in the political section
                    external unit then, essentially went along as notetaker for, and wrote up the
                    cables. This was all focused on “What do we ultimately do? How do we engage in
                    negotiations?” It was leading up to the Paris meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see yourself in this? Did you want to get out
                        in the field? Was Vietnamese such a prerequisite that this was sort of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Vietnamese was an absolute prerequisite. It was my introduction to that
                    and made me understand that I couldn't be a political officer unless I had at
                    least one of the languages of whatever country I might be in. In any case, the
                    rotation that was coming up was into the commercial section. That was after the
                    May offensive in '68. I went to the commercial section.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing that from May of '68 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: June of '68 to April or May of '69. Then I went to do a protocol related
                    job for the ambassador's office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the commercial section. Who was your
                        boss?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The boss was Richard C. “Dick” Devine. Above him was Bill Sharpe, an AID
                    official. The commercial section was under the joint economic section, State and
                    others. I can remember wondering if I was in good hands because one of the last
                    things I did as political officer, was to be at a meeting of a delegation,
                    possibly a Congressional Delegation, with the economic counselor at which there
                    was talk about what all of Southeast Asia was doing. There was nothing coming
                    back to the visitors, and I interjected, “Well, this all might be related as
                    part of the way that this new Association of Southeast Asian Nations develops.”
                    ASEAN was founded in '67 or '68. The economic counselor didn't seem to have
                    heard of it and didn't know anything about it. A little alarm bell went off in
                    my head.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about commercial life at that time. In the
                        middle of the war, one doesn't think about a commercial officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, this was deliberate. There was a commodity import program, a CIP
                    program, and a major effort to get business going between American suppliers and
                    Vietnamese buyers using U.S. government money to help fund all of this. That was
                    the period when the Department of Commerce still did the World Trade Directory
                    Report, the WTDR. I got actively involved in that. We were also working with the
                    Vietnamese Directorate of Foreign Trade. Dick Devine's only rating comment that
                    rests in my mind was that I was able to measurably improve relations with the
                    Vietnamese official who was the director for foreign trade because I could speak
                    French with hiin other words, wasn't insisting that he use his non-existent
                    English or a translator. I can't remember any specific thing.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Relatively little, but there were lots of issues about corruption and
                    corrupt practices and bribing officials. The commercial office also had as one
                    of its other functions monitoring excess property sales from the military. That
                    was a very difficult thing to do. There was a huge amount of scrap brass being
                    generatelots of scrap metal from vehicles that weren't maintained well or had
                    battle damage. There were several Vietnamese firms that were dealing in melting
                    down scrap. Very complicated set of inspections and investigations and that sort
                    of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time we didn't have a federal law against
                        anti-bribery, did we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Not to the best of my recollection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It came later. Were the French in there using their?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I do not recall any specific detail of French embassy/French government
                    commercial action. Their embassy was still in Hanoi and they had a consulate
                    general in Saigon. I think they were much more political than they were
                    commercial and just simply let longtime business contacts between France and
                    Vietnam carry the trade side. I could be mistaken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Chinese dominant in trade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The commercial market part of Saigon, Cholon, actually means “Big
                    Market.” There was an enormous Sino-Vietnamese community, but it was
                    Sino-Vietnamese, which is a bit more congenial than the Chinese community in
                    Cambodia proved to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a solid commercial life at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Very solid. Very active. Everything from importing Mercedes Benz to the
                    sale of scrap steel and imports of textiles and cloth and cotton. Lively market
                    activity. Electronics. Tools. Machinery. Various parts and bits and pieces for
                    repairing their tools and machinery and consumer goods.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned corruption. Were we trying to root out
                        corruption?</hi>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>CARNEY: We were more interested in where it applied to political matterwho was
                    buying whom, who was renting whom, and what the quid pro quo was. I do remember
                    being waved off corruption stories in the political section partly because of
                    lack of evidence and partly because of a philosophical belief that we couldn't
                    totally impose our standards on other cultures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also there was the thing that comes up again and again
                        that if there is what we call corruption, if reports go back to Washington,
                        they get leaked and they give ammunition to the enemies of doing anything
                        with X country. So, you can report it once, but if you continue to report
                        it, it isn't helping at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The most complicated and difficult intersection of this problem was with
                    our allies, the Filipinos, the Koreans in II CORPS, enormous problems of
                    corruption, and the Thais, of course. Whenever the commissary would get a
                    shipment of tape decks in, you would see these three elements with their people
                    there all with the proper amount of MPC (military payment certificates in lieu
                    of green dollars) and their ration cards in hand to buy out 200 units that would
                    ultimately be sold to the black market.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember watching Thai contingents marching in and all
                        buying things they obviously needed like shampoo and feminine products and
                        the like, all getting exactly the same thing and then coming out and piling
                        into a truck while the provost marshal got red in the face watching this.
                        There wasn't much you could do about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was very difficult. Was there talk of saying, “Well,

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I only remember that from my Cambodian days.</p>

                <p>In '69, you moved over to protocol?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: Briefly, yes, and the only thing I can remember doing in that was
                    counting up the number of general and flag officers of the United States in
                    Vietnam, which had reached 107 for 500,000 troops.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I didn't really have an impression of him. He was far too remote for me
                    to get much of an impression. I am going to be interested to see the biography
                    that Howard Schaffer is now doing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, a number of us hung out together. I used to play a lot of bridge
                    with some of them as well. Then there was a very active social life within the
                    younger people of various embassies and some Vietnamese as well. But there was
                    much less of that and I had much less time for it. Certainly after the Tet
                    offensive, things got intensively busy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you discern a divide that often happens when we've
                        got a controversial policy of the junior officers wanting to get out and
                        change the world and the more senior officers wanting to keep things the way
                        they are?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, I didn't see anything like that. The junior officers got engaged with
                    Vietnam as Vietnam is, especially the language officers. They developed a deep
                    interest and affection for the country as a country apart from the issues of war
                    and policy. We generally recognized that what we were doing was not going to
                    effect the independence of South Vietnam. We didn't know how to do it any better
                    except that there were clearly some things - our relations with the Saigon
                    government, our approach to enhancing the capabilities of the South Vietnamese
                    armthat just simply weren't being properly addressed until General Creighton
                    Abrams became MACV Commander and started to work on it after Westmoreland's
                    unlamented departure. Those issues of how do you get Thieu and his government to
                    govern seriously? How do you make the South Vietnamese armed forces capable? And
                    what to do about corruption, not only of South Vietnamese entities, but also
                    among our allies and elements within ourselves? Those three were touched on
                    heavily. There was some discussion of the Phoenix Program, but it was more on
                    whether it was succeeding rather than the morality of it or whether it was
                    right.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: I knew one fairly well who was there under an alias as I subsequently
                    discovered when we ran across each other elsewhere in the world. He seemed to be
                    okay but no great shakes. That realization persisted throughout my career.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Not really. What I found was, people who had that experience over the
                    years generally had better judgment on what was possible to do diplomatically,
                    and indeed with the entire quiver of our foreign policy tools. People who didn't
                    have the judgment notably include mainly people engaged in the Middle East,
                    because so few people with that specialty ever went to Vietnam, plus they had
                    their political masters here in Washington, the Israeli lobby breathing down the
                    necks of whatever they might report or try to recommend? Basically the Vietnam
                    hands in my experience just seemed to have their head better screwed on their

                <p>CARNEY: Elaine Schunter was the personnel officer at the time in Saigon. Elaine
                    and I got along pretty well, partly because she felt guilty that she had failed
                    to file the first efficiency report, and delayed my movement from FSO-8 to 7 for
                    six months. The time didn't concern me at all. The assignment to Maseru came in
                    and she said she didn't know where it was. Well, neither did I. She said, “I
                    think it's Africa, but I'll call you back.” She called me back and said, “Oh,
                    you don't want to go.” They actually had the post report. She sent it over. To
                    this day, I can remember how it starts: “Snakes are not a problem if common
                    sense precautions are taken. The grass airport lands flights twice weekly from
                    Johannesburg.” The initial paragraph reads, “Lesotho is inhabited by the Basotho
                    people, all of whom speak Sesotho. The king of the country is Moshoeshoe.” Every
                    term had its phonetic pronunciation. It just goes on and on like that. It was my
                    second assignment, so I decided, of course, I'd go.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: Not at this point.</p>
                <p>Q: You'd better describe where Lesotho is and the circumstances of its
                    development.</p>
                <p>CARNEY: Lesotho was one of the three British High Commission Territories in
                    southern Africa. It is the only one totally surrounded by the Republic of South
                    Africa. It was founded on the run from Shaka Zulu's impis in the first third of
                    the 19th century by Moshoeshoe I, who took refuge on a hill that was very easy
                    to fortify and defend against the weapons that the Zulu impis were using. They
                    fought off the various Zulus, then fought off the Boer moving out of the Cape in
                    the trek of the 1830s. But through astute statesmanship and advice from a set of
                    Protestant missionaries who had arrived in the 1830s as well, the Basotho
                    managed to get themselves inserted as a “flea in Queen Victoria's blanket” and
                    became a protectorate of the British in the 1860s or '70s. It maintained that
                    status until it looked as if the British were going to merge the High Commission
                    Territories with South Africa in the period after WW I. But the ascension of Jan
                    Smuts and the United Party in South Africa and, while not apartheid, a growing
                    effort to limit the freedoms of blacks in southern Africa, caused the British to
                    delay. Then with the 1949 electoral victory of the Nationalist Party as the
                    Afrikaners had out bred the English speakers, the continuation of those three
                    High Commission Territories was guaranteed. The Brits just simply were not going
                    to turn them over to apartheid South Africa. In the mid-'60s, they regained
                    their actual independence, which they all three hold to this day.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>U.S. Policy was to support the independence, and prove the viability of black run
                    states in southern Africa. We wound up with, first, a rotating charg� d'affaires
                    and then resident embassies headed by charg� d'affaires because Senator
                    Fulbright didn't want us willy nilly to put full fledged embassies in all of
                    black Africa, which was politically a mistake. That ultimately changed as the
                    charg� were upgraded in the '70s to ambassadors.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I didn't. I flew into the nearest large South African town, Bloemfontein,
                    one of the three capitals of South Africa. The judiciary is headquartered in
                    Bloemfontein. Bloemfontein exists on land stolen, by the British under Captain
                    Warden's 1855 decision, from the Kingdom of Lesotho of the epoch. It's a 90-mile
                    ride from Bloemfontein Airport to Maseru Bridge across the Caledon River. My
                    predecessor met me with every sign of relief in his eyes, Peter Jones, son of
                    Ambassador Jones. I think Peter himself got an embassy. I arrived in dusty
                    Maseru to take up residence at the house we were renting for the junior officer,
                    there only being 2 Foreign Service officers, a Secretary-Communicator, a USIA
                    representative, a Peace Corps director, and a couple dozen volunteers.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: This was pretty close to the end of the earth but it looked interesting.
                    It didn't take any time at all to realize that the people in Lesotho were very
                    squared away, warm, welcoming, and solid.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the government like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was an elected government under Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan. A year
                    after independence, there had been parliamentary elections which the Basotholand
                    National Party, the BNP, had won, and Leabua Jonathan of a chiefly family had
                    become prime minister. Their opposition was the Basotholand Congress Party,
                    which was very leftist for the time under Ntsu Mokhele. There were elections
                    scheduled for January of 1970 as well, so we were approaching an electoral
                    period when I got there in August.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: He was a constitutional monarch at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he a tribal chief as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: He was. There was a political party, the Marematlou Freedom Party, that
                    supported enhanced powers for the king, but they were very much of a
                    minority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the charg�?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Initially and for a temporary period it was Edward A. Dow, Jr. He was
                    there with his wife, Virginia. He was an old India hand and Indonesia hand, but
                    he had come from somewhere in North Africa to do this just before he retired. He
                    was old Foreign Service, a good man. He was replaced by Stephen Gurney Gebelt,
                    who had at one point been charg� in Salisbury before he became charg� in Maseru,
                    and had had any number of other posts.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: I vaguely remember being so urgently needed that no time was available
                    even for the Area Studies course at FSI. If I left Saigon in June and got to
                    Maseru in August and I had home leave I didn't really have time for much. I
                    remember Oliver Crosby was the director of AF/S. I had some conversations there
                    in Washington, but nothing else sticks in my memory.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, but that was clearly what I ultimately wound up doing: South Africa
                    watching. Lesotho, you can pretty much grasp in three months. I had enough
                    contacts that I knew what was going on especially after the coup in January of
                    1970.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the coup come about?</hi>

                    because his party had lost.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this make any difference from our point of view or was
                        this just watching a group of people who had their own way of doing
                        things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It made a difference because it affected the Peace Corps mission. We drew
                    it down dramatically. It certainly affected the view of Lesotho as a democracy.
                    But it didn't ultimately keep us from putting in an ambassador and then
                    installing a resident AID mission. AID had previously been effected by the
                    Office of Southern African Regional Affairs. The relationship just ticked
                    along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about working within Lesotho. How did you find
                        dealing with the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The relationship with the government? We were very interested in
                    community development and development in Lesotho in general. It's a rocky
                    country with much of the best land having been acquired by the notorious Captain
                    Warden 100 years previously. As a result, the ambassador's self-help fund, all
                    $10,000 munificent dollars of it, was under my control. The charg� rarely wanted
                    to go out to an opening or anything, so I was all over the country at the
                    opening of a village water system or a dam or a schoolhouse that we had built or
                    that we had helped to fund the materials for or to build. Up until the coup of
                    January 1970, relationships were very straightforward with the usual demarches
                    for support on UN-related matters at General Assembly time. Entertainment of
                    government officials and the whole panoply of people active in Lesotho,
                    including the small number of embassies proceeded in traditional foreign service
                    style. The Brits had an active high commission. Taiwan had their ambassador
                    there in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the South Africans calling the shots?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Not at all. The South Africans were in an interesting position. They were
                    willing to second civil servants to Lesotho. The chief justice of Lesotho,
                    Geldenhuys, was a South African, and a number of officials from the South
                    African government were seconded. There wasn't an embassy and relationships were
                    conducted on sort of an ad hoc basis. We had had a visit of the notorious
                    minister for Bantu affairs, Piet Koornhof. One of my earliest recollections of
                    South Africa watching from Lesotho was when he returned to be interpolated or
                    maybe just to answer questions in parliament. Asked if he had not sat down and
                    dined with Kaffirs. He said he had indeed but he had done it for his country,
                    not because he enjoyed it. This was likely iFebruary or March of 1970 as
                    parliament sits in South Africa, or did, in January, during the summer in the
                    Cape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Peace Corps doing and how effective were
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>CARNEY: I didn't know how effective they were. I didn't have any clue whether or
                    if they were effective. I knew that they were all out, for the most part, in
                    villages, many engaged in teaching. This was before the Peace Corps became so
                    active in hands-on development projects.</p>
                <p>I built a volleyball court in my backyard with the assistance of Peace Corps
                    volunteers who liberated some cement and poles to put the net up. Every Saturday
                    and Sunday afternoon, the Peace Corps came over for volleyball. Whoever was in
                    Maseru was welcome to come. I had taken up with a British girl at that time, so
                    there was more of a social aspect to some aspects of life than professional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the embassy? How was it run?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There were only three Americans in the embassy itself: the charg�
                    d'affaires, myself (I was also consul), and a secretary who was also a
                    communicator. One of the things I had done in Washington was to acquire backup
                    communication training on the HW28, a glorified telex. We had a receptionist who
                    was very capable and a driver. I think there was a handyman and a driver as
                    well. We were in an office building until we negotiated with the landlord of a
                    number of our properties to build a chancery. We got the land allocated by the
                    chief of Maseru itself and used a lease purchase agreement to acquire the
                    building that is to this day the U.S. chancery in Maseru, Lesotho. We moved in
                    there in late 1970. Assistant Secretary David Newsom came down as part of an
                    Africa trip to dedicate the building. It was right next door to the house that
                    was rented for me. The house next to me was the PAO. The one next to that was
                    the secretary-communicator. So, we had sort of an American row on the main drag
                    coming from the border point up into downtown Maseru.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the place run?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The charg� d'affaires was very much old school. He basically let things
                    run by indirection rather than active leadership. One of his predecessors had
                    actually taken the job too seriously and had the secretary taking work home at
                    night. That man and I subsequently had a conversation about 15 years later. We
                    ran into each other in the cafeteria. In Maseru we had overlapped for a week. I
                    had come from Saigon and almost laughed out loud at him when he asked if I had
                    done something within an hour of his having asked me to do it. He had so clearly
                    lost his sense of perspective and proportion. He seemed to recall that event. He
                    said, “As I look back on Lesotho, I went over the top.” That's not a direct
                    quote, but sort of an implicit apology is how I took it and I think is how he
                    meant it. I said, “Well, you should have seen what came after you.” One of his
                    predecessors wound up being relieved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened with his successor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>CARNEY: That man basically was sent to Lesotho, kind of put out to pasture,
                    because he had had problems with alcohol before. But the prime minister's coup,
                    as he aborted the 1970 elections, caused a series of problems of violence in the
                    country, and included the arrest of members of the opposition party, and some
                    deaths. The extra stress ensured that he could not keep his drinking under
                    control. He would have occasional episodes and these episodes unfortunately were
                    at parties when he would, out of nowhere, seize on something another guest might
                    say, and most intemperately verbally attack them. After a number of these, he
                    wound up doing the same at the chancery with me. I just left the office, went
                    back to my residence, at which the secretary-communicator shortly appeared, also
                    shaken. We had a drink together, wondered what to do. I had pretty much decided
                    what I was going to do when the charg� arrived. He apologized for whatever he
                    might have done, which is the usual non-apology, and argued that if we were
                    going to make any report, we should hold off because he was a sick man, not
                    likely to last much longer. He left and I immediately called the administrative
                    officer in Pretoria who had regional responsibility for the posts and followed
                    with a letter. We got an inspector in three weeks who ultimately recommended
                    that the man be relieved, but it took another 4 or 5 months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's always the problem. This put a burden on you as a
                        junior officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Fortunately, I had the Saigon tour. It was an enormous gyroscope. I
                    suppose it built a reputation for me as able to handle a range of conflicts.</p>
                <p>Q: Speaking of conflicts, with the coup business, were we getting any signs of
                    interest from Washington about it?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: There was a successful effort to moderate the policies of the new coup
                    government. Chief Jonathan publicly said to “Time Magazine” in an article on
                    Africa's “durable popinjays,” “I've made a coup and I'm proud of it.” But the
                    charg�, who could be most effective, would go over, and in the most
                    dispassionate manner point out alternatives and suggest behaviors that would
                    preserve Lesotho's international position. Many times, that advice was on how to
                    deal, for example, with unhappiness over Peace Corps volunteers who were
                    reflecting the opinions of the people of the areas they were resident in, as to
                    the illegality of the regime. I think it kept Chief Jonathan's government from
                    excesses to which it would have given itself. There was also a deputy prime
                    minister who was torturing people in his residence in downtown Maseru, screams
                    coming out and what have you, and this was a matter of some concern as well,
                    even in pre-human rights Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about before and after the coup? You mentioned making
                        demarches on UN votes? I would think Lesotho would be one of those countries
                        where we could for modest support, financial or what have you, be up for
                        grabs? Or did it vote with the African Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I think Lesotho generally voted with the OAU, but not so outrageously.
                    Lesotho, with Taiwan resident, wasn't voting for Red Chinese UN membership, for
                    example. Because it had that vote at the UN and the cable was a circular, I just
                    went in and did it.</p>

                    Africa.</p>
                <p>CARNEY: We didn't, but that's probably alright because we did no reporting on
                    South Africa itself from Lesotho. There was a bit of coverage of relations
                    between the Lesotho and the Boer but nothing of great significance. It was an
                    odd period in Lesotho when many senior civil service positions, and indeed the
                    Chief Justice himself, were not onlSouth Africans, but an Afrikaner. The Chief
                    Justice apparently had no trouble justifying the state of emergency that Chief
                    Jonathan declared on January 23, 1970 when he aborted the elections in mid-count
                    and threw the opposition leadership into jail.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I don't think it was calculated in the rigging. It was generic to the
                    structure of the appeals and the high court that you would have South African
                    civil servants in that. The police, by contrast, did not have South Africans in
                    it. The Lesotho Mounted Policthere was no army at the timessentially was
                    officered by the British, funded by their ODA. It included officers with
                    experience in Aden, one of the men whom I knew. They were the officers for the

                    being back here in Washington and a particular friend of mine, Stephen T.
                    Johnson, who's the son of the late U. Alexis Johnson, invited me over to the
                    Johnson's for dinner. I mentioned to U.A. Johnson that I had hoped to get
                    Chinese. He said how fascinating he was sure that Cambodia would prove to be as

                </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you picking up before you went out there about
                        Cambodia and the culture and how things were going from your teachers and
                        just getting ready for it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: To start with, our actual presence there was enormously controversial.
                    You'll recall Kent State when we invaded Cambodia.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: The teachers were quite a good crew. One of them is a friend to this day.
                    We were all at dinner at a mutual friend's house just 3 weeks ago. Kem Sos?
                    Madeleine Ehrman was the linguist. It quickly became the sort of Gestapo
                    interrogation style of language learning. I was the only student. I have a high
                    aptitude and used it to try to push the learning of the language. An interesting
                    language: Words are essentially one syllable unless they're borrowed from Pali
                    and Sanskrit. No tones. But the alphabeand thank God it has onis based on a 4th
                    century Indian script, so it's affectionately known as “worm tracks.” The number
                    of vowels and diphthongs are many more than exist in English, which causes a
                    certain complication to us English speakers when we try to pronounce it
                    correctly. But there were no surprises in the language. Once you get the
                    alphabet down, the grammar is very straightforward and it's a question of
                    building vocabulary. FSI hadn't yet learned that you've got to get students
                    capable of reading or they're never going to build vocabulary, but that
                    ultimately came.</p>
                <p>The culture? There were no Cambodian restaurants and very few Cambodians in the
                    U.S. in those days: Refugees from the Sihanouk period were people like my
                    teachers for the most part. Very little was published on Cambodia in English at
                    that time. I got a few books in French. A political memoir came out: Jean Claude
                    Pomonti's Courtesans aux Partisans. But I don't think I got that until I got to
                    Cambodia. Lots of gushy stuff existed from the Kennedy period, even from the
                    '50s from the Eisenhower-Nixon period. I think Vice President Nixon visited
                    Cambodia in the Eisenhower era. But nothing really gave me any clue as to what
                    Cambodia was beyond the fact that Cambodians built Angkor Wat, which is to this
                    day one of the wonders of the world, the largest single religious structure on
                    the planet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to visit or did they make arrangements to
                        talk to some of our people who were coming out of there on leave or
                        something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The problem was that we had broken relations with Cambodia in about 1964.
                    The Aussies ensured our interests. There were no resident official Americans
                    until about 1969 or '70 even. So there wasn't anybody. Frank Tatu was the desk
                    officer. Frank was a wonderful, very particular Foreign Service officer, clearly
                    has his own drummer and his own fifer. He had gotten so interested in Cambodia
                    he had actually done a “Chronology of Developments Affecting Cambodia” on the
                    country dating back to the Funan period in the 3rd or 4th century AD. I
                    eventually updated it, since I thought it was so worthwhile, when I finished my
                    tour there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '72 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: To the day a battalion landing team of the U.S. Marines from the USS
                    Okinawa removed the Embassy staff April 12, 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, you were really the new boy on the
                        block. I think the view of somebody who has just arrived is different than
                        somebody who's an old hand and comes back. What was your observation when
                        you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I got there late April 1972, which is the beginning of the rainy season.
                    It's the same monsoon that India has. I was to replace Don Jameson. Don stayed,
                    which was good because that meant there were two language officers in the
                    political section. The embassy was very complicated in its structure. There was
                    a huge military equipment delivery team (MEDT) with a brigadier general in
                    charge, the late John R.D. Cleland, who had his own particular view of the way
                    things should be run. Emory Coblentz Swank was the ambassador, who left in
                    '72.</p>
                <p>I got to town and my quarters were not ready. I was going to a house that Elena
                    Adesso, the Ambassador's secretary, had had. (If Elena's around, her service is
                    so rich that she would be extremely valuable for this program.) But the house
                    wasn't quite ready, so I was put in the hotel that had been known as the Royale.
                    The times were somewhat eviler, and it was now known as the Phnom, after the
                    nearby small hillock after which the capital is named, because we had a republic
                    instead of a monarchy. But it was the massive walls, that yellow color of
                    colonial French official structures that had persisted into the independent
                    Kingdom of Cambodia: Ceiling fans, air conditioners that sometimes worked. I
                    went up there.</p>
                <p>Either the first or the second night, I had met a journalist from the Domneung
                    Peel Prik, which means “Morning's News.” It's a little more impressive in Khmer
                    than the translation. I'm sure I could give you a more elegant translation. It
                    was the late Ly Eng, who was at that time having an affair with one of the
                    foreign correspondents there, whose name I won't mention. No need for posterity.
                    We had talked a little bit. His English was better than my Khmer, so we
                    basically spoke in English. (I would often feign to speak no French to ensure
                    the conversation proceeded in Khmer.) I went up to bed the second night. It
                    could even have been the third night. But having been in Saigon before, and
                    knowing that Phnom Penh was subject to being rocketed, I also knew enough to
                    keep an outfit at the side of the bed so that I could immediately get into it in
                    case I had to go downstairs and take shelter from rocket fire. Sure enough, 122
                    millimeter rockets began coming in. I rolled out of bed, dressed in my black
                    knit outfit and dark trousers, slipped a handgun into my belt under my outfit,
                    and went downstairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Equally surely enough, Ly Eng was there and he said, “I've heard that there have
                    been some people killed near the railway station which is quite close to the
                    hotel. Let's go see what's going on.” He and I went out. I think we were in a
                    car rather than on his motor scooter, but I don't remember. Sure enough, this
                    little kid had been chopped up by a chunk of casing from this 122mm rocket, and
                    was dead with his mother disconsolate. Ly Eng asked some questions, a working
                    journalist. Then we heard a lot of automatic weapons fire from further south
                    towards the suburb of Takhmau, and we drove down there to see what was going on.
                    We were stopped at a checkpoint. There was a Cambodian general officer. I was
                    able to follow part of the discussion in Khmer. I had gotten a 2+ rating in
                    speaking when I finished the language course. But I had enough to be able to
                    follow part of the discussion. (Even with a 3 or often a 3+, it's very hard to
                    follow a discussion in which everybody is jumping in and ideas are half
                    expressed and seized on. You need basically a 4 or even a 4+ in any language to
                    do that.) But I got enough to know that there was a serious firefight going on
                    further south and it would be dangerous to go further. We did not. We went
                    back.</p>
                <p>Of course, I was introduced to the country team the next morning and reported all
                    of this to the astonishment and horror of Swank and the late Tom Enders, then
                    DCM, but not to my boss, William Harben. But one didn't do that. You weren't
                    supposed to put yourself at risk, which struck me as a very bizarre way to do
                    foreign affairs reporting in a war. You have to get out, meet people, and be out
                    of the embassy as much as you possibly could. That started the tour in Phnom
                    Penh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we describe the embassy? The ambassador was Coby
                        Swank. How did he operate? What was your impression of him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: He was extremely personable and engaging but he was the ambassador. There
                    was a huge distance between a second secretary, an FSO-6, and basically I didn't
                    see much of the ambassador or of the DCM for that matter ? except I can remember
                    one particular time? Cambodian internal politics was a matter of despair for
                    Washington. Basically, we were regularly ordered not to report on aspects of
                    Cambodian internal politics because it made life too difficult for people
                    running the policy in Washington. It was an early reinforcement of my lesson
                    from Vietnam not to let Washington tell the embassy what it could and couldn't
                    report. The corruption of the Foreign Service reporting process was well
                    accelerated in Cambodia. This was the case and Tom Enders lent himself to
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I was the duty officer one night and in those days the duty officers slept
                    overnight in the chancery. The newspapers come out at night to be read in the
                    morning, the Cambodian press. I was reading a couple of the Cambodian papers.
                    This was 6 weeks or so after the presidential election which was structured.
                    “Free and fair” would be unlikely words to put to it. Lon Nol was of course
                    elected president. He and one of the 3 or 4 people who had made the coup with
                    him? This was Sisowath Sirik Matak, from one of the minor branches of the
                    Cambodian royal family. Monarchs in Cambodia have alternated from the 1840s or
                    '50s from the Norodom branch of the family, of which the present king, Sihanouk,
                    is a member, to the Sisowath branch of the family. Sirik Matak never had a
                    chance to be king, but he was in the Sisowath branch. The French had bypassed
                    his uncle in 1941 because his uncle was a graduate of the French military
                    academy and far less tractable. The French decided to their cost that 19 year
                    old Norodom Sihanouk was infinitely more tractable, so Sihanouk became king in
                    1941 at age 19.</p>
                <p>But Sirik Matak was so annoyed at the result of the way the presidential election
                    was run and counted that he announced that he had “withdrawn confidence” in the
                    government of Lon Nol. I looked at that and said, “That can't be right.” I got
                    my dictionaries out. A Cambodian-speaking Soviet diplomat, Igor Kossikoff by
                    name, and I had come to know each other, which was extraordinary in those days.
                    He actually gave me a copy of the 1933 French-Cambodian dictionary, 2 volumes. I
                    was looking words up. I had to be absolutely sure I had it right. That's a
                    pretty significant development: One of the people who had engineered the
                    overthrow of Sihanouk withdrew confidence in the ongoing government of the
                    country!</p>
                <p>So I wrote it up and then I typed a cable. Even in those days I had figured out
                    that you could not be at the mercy of secretaries and communicators. I had
                    already learned in Lesotho how to run an HW28, which was then the one time tape
                    code machine of State Department small embassy choice, and I knew how to do the
                    green telegram forms and typed the cable up. It was on the political counselor's
                    desk in the morning. I had gone home to have breakfast and shave and shower and
                    what have you. I got back to the office and went up to the DCM's offiche had it
                    by then, Bill Harben having signed off on iand he said, “Is your translation
                    correct? Did he really say this?” I said, “Here's the paper and the translation
                    is correct.” He just shook his head. It wasn't in that context but a later,
                    similar one that Tom Enders said, “What a bunch of losers.” Of course, they did
                    lose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom Enders was the DCM. He was a major figure. How was he
                        both as an intellect and a powerful personality? How did you find him at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>CARNEY: The intellect was real. Definitely smart and always looking at an issue
                    to see whether it was real and what could be done about it if it wasn't going in
                    a direction that would serve U.S. interests. What he didn't have was the sense
                    of when things were going so badly that we had to try to get Washington to focus
                    and change policy. It was always trying to do something, rather than to
                    recognize and to make the judgment that things weren't possible and we had to do
                    something else. That is a weakness of our service. If you only spend 2 or 3
                    years in a place, you can always think that you can hold it together until you
                    leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you're pointing to a real problem. Tom Enders,
                        this was his only excursion into Asia. He later was in charge of Latin
                        American policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Did you feel there was a division between the ambassador wanting not to over
                    report on the complications of the situation which would imply the weakness of
                    the Cambodian government which we were supporting and Tom Enders and the
                    political section that said, “This is important stuff?”</p>
                <p>CARNEY: Far from it. Enders was, if anything, even more willing to accept
                    strictures on reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you and Don Jameson chafing at the bit wanting to get
                        things out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was the political counselor, Bill Harben, who was chafing. This was
                    before the dissent channel was established and there just didn't seem to be any
                    way to deal with this problem at least at my level of seniority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often there is a way. Some places nobody ever goes to, but
                        I imagine that Cambodia was pretty much on the circuit of people coming out
                        to Vietnam to see what the hell was going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: You know, it really wasn't. We had at various times Vice President Agnew,
                    Governor Connelly, and only one CODEL with Bella Abzug on it.</p>
                <p>

                <p>CARNEY: Yes, but ultimately all of that added up to an end to funding in the

                <p>CARNEY: I don't remember one when I was there. But just before I got there? It
                    might have been Moose and the late Chuck Meissner who visited when I was there.
                    But there was a Lowenstein and Moose visit before I got there where the
                    journalists had them out to a restaurant called the Tavern just opposite the
                    post office, very close to the Mekong river and fed them that wonderful
                    Cambodian delicacy known as “somlaa kancha,” which is marijuana chicken soup. It
                    immobilized them for 24 hours.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: I don't recall a large number. Of course there weren't very many visitors
                    because there was a “head space” problem. There was a decree, I think from the
                    Congress, that there be no more than 200 official Americans in Cambodia at any
                    given time. So whenever we had anybody come in, people would have to go out. It

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Basically the leadership of the mission was always over giving advice and
                    suggestions on how to do things. The military mission was trying to upgrade the
                    capacity and to prevent the Force Arm�e Nationale Khmere [FANK] from embarking
                    on adventures that cost it dear when it tried to use its enthusiasm to kick the
                    Vietnamese out of the country, lacking the command and control and tactical
                    skills or even basic training to be able to do so. They just simply got waxed in
                    Operations Chen La I and Chen La II.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, behind the Vietnamese shield, the Khmer Rouge were building up
                    their capability. By '73, the insurgent effort was very heavily, if not
                    entirely, Khmer Rouge against the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the politics centered on personal wrangling? Was it a

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was personal wrangling in Phnom Penh, who was up and who was down, who
                    could pay the cost of an air conditioner to get an audience with Lon Nol's wife,
                    for example, and what would happen if you did get such an audience? Could you
                    get a job? How much would you have to pay if you became governor of such and
                    such a province? That sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Corruption was a major issue. A number of us more junior people decided that one
                    of the areas that we had to focus on, an area totally unacceptable, was what we
                    called the “traffic in jeeps,” U.S. provided M151, A1, and A2 U.S. military
                    jeeps that became civilian registered and were driving all about Phnom Penh with
                    people's wives, mistresses, and children. We actually did a list? People started
                    taking license numbers down. There were 4 or 5 of us who did this, including one
                    or two of the military attaches. We did an airgram with all the jeeps we could
                    find civilian listings were matched against the registration numbers at the
                    Department of Motor Vehicles, and the source of origin insofar as we could
                    determine it from the engine number. This outraged the MEDTC chief, the late
                    General Cleland, whose classic comment that will live forever was, “GAO can make
                    a case against us on this.” (end of tape)</p>

                <p>CARNEY: That was, “I've got my marching orders. I'm going to effect them. I'm

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Of course. As in almost any organization, there were plenty of people who
                    do not have, or do not see, a vested personal interest in making something
                    happen that can't, and can judge things rather more dispassionately and
                    accurately. Some of his staff were that way.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I didn't make any comparisons. It didn't seem to serve anything. What was
                    clear was, one effect of the corruption was that it was so widespread and so
                    well known that it was sapping popular confidence in the Lon Nol government and
                    in popular will to resist, all the more so because Sihanouk for all of his
                    faults had been accepted as monarch and more to the point, Sihanouk had by May
                    of '70, two months after the coup, become the leading figure in the resistance.
                    The Khmer Rouge used him as their drawing card.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: I'm not sure. There had been a number of problems when operations were
                    uncovered in earlier years, the name Victor Matsui is in the press in the 50s or
                    60s. Our support for Diem in Vietnam was a proximate cause, as I recall.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Some? Don JamesoPeter Collins replaced him. On the economic side, that
                    section was joint with AID, so it was a different approach to reporting. Bruno
                    Kosheleff was there in that section. Also there was an economist who was looking
                    at larger aspects, Phil Berlin. I can't remember whether he was macro or micro.
                    There were a couple of assistant military attach�s who were pretty good: Allen
                    Armstrong was one of them; Mark Berent was the assistant air attach�. Then the
                    station was relatively small. It had 2 good reporting officers on the
                    clandestine services side. One clandestine services officer was very smart, but
                    simply couldn't recruit agents, which must make you wonder why you're in the

                <p>CARNEY: It was inadequately covered. None of the journalists held any candle,
                    much less any respect, for U.S. policy or what the embassy had to say about
                    events.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: The Cambodian press was rambunctious and relatively free, very
                    scatological and earthy in its metaphor and editorial cartoons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived, how was the military system of the Khmer

                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>CARNEY: For a long time, far past the reality, the Khmer Rouge were regarded as
                    the mere auxiliary of the Vietnamese forces. My view of it was signally limited
                    because I did not have an SI [signals intelligence] clearance. I was never shown
                    that material. That suddenly became clear to me one day when Tom Enders came
                    down and said, “The prime minister has given me this. It looks kind of
                    interesting. See what you can do and maybe report on it.” I took a look at it -
                    this was in '73. It was two long interviews by the Cambodian services of
                    individuals who had been teachers and who had gone to the Khmer Rouge after the
                    coup late in 1970, if not in '71, and had subsequently rallied to the
                    government. Basically, these documents had who the Khmer Rouge were: The
                    Communist Party of Kampuchea. It had individuals who were in it, their names -
                    these were people who had disappeared from Phnom Penh into the bush - their
                    revolutionary names or aliases.</p>
                <p>I translated it. Fortunately, the interviews were in French so I could easily
                    translate it. Translating Khmer at that point would have been damn near
                    impossible for me. I sent it around for clearance. I did it as an airgram. It
                    should have been a telegram. The NSA representative to the embassy came down and
                    said, “You've got to get this out right now.” I couldn't figure it out. Finally
                    it dawned on me: the intercepts, all the radio stuff, had the revolutionary
                    names of these people rather than their real names and this made the connection
                    between a revolutionary name and an individual. A very significant intelligence
                    coup. So, we got that out. One of those people subsequently published a book
                    which came out in late '74 called “Sranaoh Proloeung Khmer,” which I translated
                    as “Regrets for the Khmer Soul” and others have translated “Regrets of a Khmer
                    Soul.” I suspect the latter is a better translation. He, by the way, survived
                    the Khmer rouge, wound up working for the CIA on the Thai-Cambodian border in
                    1979 or 80, and is now here in the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Amazing. Were we getting reports that the Khmer Rouge was
                        really something different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: We were getting reports because my predecessor, Andy Antippas, was
                    hearing reports that in 1954 after the Geneva Accords, a number of the Cambodian
                    revolutionaries, who were not given any status as a result of the AccordSihanouk
                    wouldn't have ithose people boarded Polish ships and went to North Vietnam.
                    There were a few thousand of them. Those people began reinfiltrating after the
                    coup. By '72 or so, some of them were being executed or they would disappear.
                    Clearly the indigenous Cambodian communist movement decided that these were the
                    thin edge of a pro-Vietnamese wedge and were purging them. That ultimately led,
                    after the Khmer Rouge victory, in about 1976, to the establishment of the
                    torture/execution center at the Toul Sleng High School through which roughly
                    18,000 cadre were interrogated, tortured, and executed in the Khmer Rouge
                    period.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there anything in the Khmer character that would lend it to this type of
                    thing? Or was this sort of an import of French intellectuals, nonsense carried
                    to the nth degree?</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>CARNEY: The Cambodian communist movement has basically 3 strains. One of them is
                    Vietnamese. Essentially it was the Vietnamese who brought communism to Cambodia.
                    The second strain comes from a group of younger Cambodians who went off to
                    France to study in the late '40s. The late Pol Pot himself - his real name is
                    Saloth Sagot a scholarship and went off to study radio electronics. He was even
                    in Yugoslavia building agricultural projects at one point and doing Socialist
                    International duties. The third strain is completely indigenous. The deputy
                    secretary of the communist party of Kampuchea's standing committee, is Nuon
                    Chea, although did get some education outside of Cambodia, in Bangkok at one of
                    the universities therit might have been Thammasat University. So you had those 3
                    strains in the party.</p>
                <p>Marxism must have seemed attractive if you were not a royalist. Then the idea of
                    Leninism, that there would be a party with a leading role in the revolution, was
                    even more attractive because it meant they were the leading role, were in
                    charge. And so the Cambodian communist party was definitely Marxist-Leninist.
                    You have to throw Lenin in there because that's how you do your leadership.</p>
                <p>To answer your question specifically, there is no more or less in the Cambodian
                    character that lends itself to that kind of nonsense than there is in anybody
                    else's character, including our own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ruthlessness with which this was carried ouyou might
                        say the extreme logijust seems to be excessive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It's, in fact, no different than Stalin or Mao or Idi Amin or Hitler. It
                    was less systematic. There is a book in the process of being done now by an
                    American academic whom I first met when he was just becoming a graduate studenhe
                    was in CambodiStephen Heder. Steve stayed with us the first 3 or 4 months of
                    this year (2003) while he had a fellowship at the Holocaust Museum. His studies
                    are pretty convincing in showing that, however bad the Khmer Rouge were, they
                    were nowhere near as systematic as the Nazis, that defining an out group
                    initially caused a lot of slaughter, and a lot of it was revenge for roles taken
                    during the civil war, but you just didn't have that machine that the Nazis
                    built. Maybe it was because the Nazis had to operate on a larger scale. Cambodia
                    never had more than 8 million people or so.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: No, there was growing apathy. My own view was mistaken. It was that the
                    Khmer Rouge are going to win. There is certainly no stomach in America for
                    continuing to pour money into Cambodia, much less Vietnam. Yes, there are going
                    to be executions. Unless they get out, we're talking a few thousand people who
                    will be chopped. And then Cambodia will more or less be Cambodian. Certainly it
                    will be on the left side. But I never envisaged the scale of what the Khmer
                    Rouge did, beginning with the evacuation of the cities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the mistakes that we made in evaluating Vietnam was
                        that we saw somehow the Chinese and the Vietnamese being together like lips

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Utter nonsense. The Vietnamese had a much greater role in creating and
                    sustaining the Khmer Rouge than was initially? Initially they were believed to
                    be totally in control. That was not the case. But the role was infinitely
                    greater - Steve Header's book is going to document thafor an infinitely longer
                    time than anyone can imagine. For example, I had incredible difficulty when I
                    was at Cornell after leaving CambodiI had a State Dept.-funded academic yeaand I
                    did a monograph, a Data Paper in the series of the Southeast Asia program,
                    “Communist Party Power in Kampuchea.” It included an introduction to the party
                    and what we knew about it and the translations of some documents, part of Ith
                    Sarin, and “A Short Guide to Party Statutes,” that was a captured document I
                    managed to find, and a number of issues of the Cambodian youth publication
                    “Revolutionary Young Men and Women.” I had an incredibly difficult time
                    translating it. I had Kem Sos help me and he couldn't make head or tail of it,
                    largely it was because the terms were taken from Vietnamese. The intellectual
                    capital of communism came through the Vietnamese. It just didn't make any sense
                    in Cambodian.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Exactly. But they had used it by the time you got there, and it was in
                    currency. This was all stuff that never existed in the language before. My Khmer
                    at that time was maybe 3+/3+, 3+/4. I thought it was me until I got hold of Sos
                    and then a separate translator. They couldn't make head or tail out of it
                    either.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, there were relatively fewer Vietnamese troops in Cambodia at that
                    point. There might have been in the highlands on the southern edge of the trail,
                    but not as far across as they had been during the Sihanouk period, nor when they
                    were destroying elements of Lon Nol's forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a general feeling that if they succeeded in
                        overthrowing the South Vietnamese government that they would hack out quite
                        a bit of Cambodia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The longstanding Vietnamese desire dating back certainly to the 19th
                    century was to make Cambodia and Laos fiefdoms. Indeed, the Vietnamese tried to
                    do that in the mid-early 19th century, including insisting that Cambodian
                    royalty wear Vietnamese court dress and dress their hair Vietnamese style. If
                    you look at the position of Cambodia, the essential geopolitical reality was
                    that Cambodia was a football between Vietnam and Thailand. The Thais ultimately
                    ended Vietnam's dominant position in Cambodia in the 19th century. Then the
                    Cambodians fled to the French for protection in 1863 with King Norodom.</p>
                <p>The Vietnamese in the modern political era, the 20th century, decided they wanted
                    to create an Indochinese federation of communist states. That was the goal they
                    had in creating and supporting the Cambodian communist party in 1950 or '51. The
                    strategic belief was that if the Vietnamese got control of Laos and Cambodia,
                    Thailand would be threatened because there is a major invasion route between
                    Cambodia and Thailand at the town of Aranyaprathet, which is a geographical area
                    that is flat and is ideal cavalry country. Historically, the Cambodians invaded
                    through that Watana Gap when they gained suzerainty over what is now modern
                    Thailand. It's perfect tank country in the modern period. The Vietnamese are
                    known to enjoy tank warfare. So, for larger strategic reasons, blunting those
                    Vietnamese objectives was in U.S. interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the French playing any role while you were

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The French indeed had an embassy, but they were not particularly active,
                    certainly not in support of Lon Nol. Their embassy ultimately was the refuge for
                    what was in the international community after the Khmer Rouge came into the city
                    on April 15.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm always interested in capturing the impression of the

                        impression and that of your colleagues of Lon Nol and his government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>CARNEY: It was clearly not going anywhere. Incompetent. Corrupt. Lon Nol himself
                    was a Cambodian mystic of very little popularity, and less leadership. Clearly
                    it couldn't come out right. It was so obvious that I came to be puzzled as to
                    what Washington could be thinking about the U.S. role in Cambodia, however much
                    the Cambodians merited being free of Sihanouk and of the Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the residue of feeling about Sihanouk within the
                        embassy? They hadn't been there during his time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There wasn't any question that Sihanouk's dead hand on Cambodian politics
                    had led to the then current impasse. He would buy people off or have them exiled
                    or even killed so that he could stay in charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was no feeling that he was a white knight or

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The feeling, which Swank's ultimate successor, John Gunther Dean, came to
                    was that Sihanouk was an element of the solution. As flawed as he was, he was
                    the only possible way the U.S. could get out and try to ensure that there was a
                    brake on a communist victory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there when John Gunther Dean came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've had some interviews with him when he comes in from

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Complete and total difference in the way he did things. He was interested
                    in learning as much as he could about all the disparate elements of Cambodian
                    society. I put him together with youth and student leaders and with some monks
                    at one point basically to help give him as broad a view of Cambodian society as
                    he could possibly get.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the result of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I think it helped him form his view of the need to move quickly towards
                    some kind of negotiated solution, a controlled solution, as he has publicly put
                    it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes. In fact, I have a good friend who is an English journalist, William
                    Shawcross, who visited me at Cornell in that period after the war, and we
                    discussed that very issue and decided the word “sideshow” was adequate to
                    describe the view of Cambodia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What book did he write?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: “Sideshow: Nixon-Kissinger and the Destruction of Cambodia.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, were we that much of a player in Cambodia? From
                        what you're saying, you have an incompetent government and a military that
                        was also incompetent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Let me add here this isn't to say there weren't some good soldiers who
                    were good; some leaders paying their troops, doing the job, and seriously
                    fighting. There were plenty of those. But on the whole the national leadership
                    and the military leadership were both corrupt and incompetent. It is the usual
                    contradiction, to borrow the Marxist word, of the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What could we have done about it anyway? In some ways I
                        often feel that we absorb all the sins of whatever happens on ourselves. If
                        the South Vietnamese couldn't make it and the Cambodians couldn't make it,
                        it's our fault. How do you feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I don't think it's as stark as that. The elements that are there include
                    our unwillingness to analyze those situations before we jump in with both feet.
                    That is certainly the case in the Cambodian situation. But we were surprised by
                    it. Sihanouk was doing what we wanted and he was giving us the information on
                    where the Vietnamese were. We were hitting them. Then he'd shout and scream in
                    the press. But we were getting what we wanted out of it. We were surprised when
                    the coup took place, there isn't any doubt about that. I've always believed that
                    that was an action by Lon Nol and his people that had nothing to do with the
                    U.S. We might have known about it at certain levels that there was something
                    coming but-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We weren't even in the country in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, we were close enough to people doing the coup. We likely had a
                    heads up at the intermediate level.</p>
                <p>Then the first thing we did was transfer some weapons to Lon Nol's coup
                    government from captured stocks in Vietnam. Then Sihanouk went on the air and
                    basically called for the Cambodian equivalent of a jihad against Lon Nol and his
                    people with Chinese and Vietnamese support. The Soviets had an embassy in Phnom
                    Penh, but they were basically encouraging the Khmer Rouge, too. It unraveled.
                    Kissinger has an interesting comment. He said, “Sometimes you just have to pick
                    the least bad option as you see it at the time.” I think that's where you're
                    going. There is a whole lot of truth to it. At no point did we ever step back
                    and look at Cambodia and weigh it and say, “This situation would be better
                    resolved if we went to the Chinese and Sihanouk and the Vietnamese and said,
                    'How can we best restore peace in Cambodia?'" It was never an option.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm trying to capture your observation at the time. Was

                <p>CARNEY: I didn't see it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I found it very difficult. If nothing else, it was a

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: All the more so because Sihanouk, in fact, had effectively ended that
                    supply role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Chinese probably didn't have any representation there,

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I think the Chinese embassy had been closed. The Soviets were there.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: It unraveled because the Khmer Rouge gained in size and strength and
                    competency. They began seizing government artillery units and pieces and began
                    shelling Phnom Penh with artillery as well as rockets. A 107 millimeter rocket
                    has a 5-7 kilometer range, which is pretty close. Your 105 millimeter artillery
                    piece has got an 11 mile?</p>

                    tons a day by air in those days with the cargo craft we had. It cost too
                    much.</p>

                    No stone would be on top of another there as a result of such an attack.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Let's say I moved some of my effects out in early '75. My ex-wife and
                    daughter - I got married in Cambodistayed until early '75.</p>
                <p>Q: Where did you meet your wife?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: A cocktail party in Phnom Penh. She's Cambodian.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Teacher. Her father had been a district chief, which was an appointed
                    position from the central government rather than elected. Her late brother had
                    been extremely active and close to Lon Nol's brother, Lon Non, and the 2 of them
                    were working with the CIA early on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, she wasn't. She was part of the Cambodian elite that was glad
                    Sihanouk was gone, didn't have any respect for Lon Nol, much closer to
                    Sihanouk's cousin, Sisowath Sirik Matak and that royalist side, although she was
                    also close to some of the military wives. I never really got serious political

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: '75, that last 4 months? It was New Year's Eve of '75 that the Khmer
                    Rouge began a major set of attacks around Phnom Penh city. Then every week was
                    further downhill, including closing the Mekong and what have you.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the embassy doing at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Dean was trying to get Kissinger to start talks with no success. I'm sure
                    he's gone into that in some detail. I was talking to my contacts, including
                    senior Buddhist monks. It just was clear that there wasn't any way out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With these aircraft coming in with supplies, were we

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Not until March. We drew the embassy American staff down the end of March
                    and then we started moving Cambodians out that were associated with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your wife and child?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: They had gone earlier. I sent them off in February.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a time when you saw that this was going to be
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It would have been sometime around February or March of '75. I was
                    supposed to be shipped out with the rest of the non-essential staff. I went to
                    the DCM, Bob Keely, or maybe the political counselor, Ray Perkins, and I said,
                    “Look, it doesn't make any sense not to have a Cambodian speaker here. It would
                    be a good idea if I stayed.” He said, “So you want to stay?” I said, “Yes.” He
                    said, “Let me talk to the ambassador.” So I stayed.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it an embassy that was? One thinks of what happened in
                        Saigon with our ambassador there who was living in a wonderland almost and
                        was not making the proper preparations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Not the case in Cambodia. Keely had to go out because he had a bleeding
                    ulcer but he came back. He and Dean were looking at making sure that the people
                    who should got out with us, that everything was properly destroyed. In fact, I
                    can remember the day we choppered out, April 12. The political counselor and I
                    drove to the prime minister's house and there was a cabinet meeting in session.
                    Long Boret was prime minister. He had already been called because we were
                    offering places for all the Cambodian cabinet and their families. Nope. Only one
                    went with us: the minister of youth and sports and his wife and one or 2
                    kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They thought they could make a deal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: To this day, I'm not sure I know what they thought. They had their own
                    plans ready. They had helicopters positioned in the Olympic stadium to fly to
                    Thailand if they couldn't make a deal. In fact, they used them except Boret
                    didn't make the helicopters and was executed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were horror stories coming in about the Khmer Rouge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Ken Quinn did a wonderful airgram from Vietnam in '73 about what Khmer
                    Rouge rule was like when they began taking over parts of the countryside in
                    southeastern Cambodia near the border. It was prophetic, but at the same time
                    when you read that and when you heard the horror stories you could argue that
                    these were the exigencies to which the movement was forced due to B52 targeting,
                    due to the difficulties of mobilizing the countryside to fight Phnom Penh, which
                    is the way I looked at it. In fact, it prefigured what they were going to do
                    when they were in charge. They basically decided to empty Phnom Penh because
                    they didn't want any networks left in place or any focal points for civil
                    disturbance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were units of the Lon Nol government army going over to

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening the last day or 2? What did you

                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>CARNEY: I think I had some people over the night before, let some of my in-laws
                    know? I told them to come and pick whatever they wanted up from the house, the
                    storeroom, which they did the next day. I had some journalists over. We finished
                    the champagne. I think I dropped by and gave some money to the usual people, the
                    tennis trainers at the Cercle Sportif, without? Well, everybody knew we were
                    going. It was very much an open secret by then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your wife's family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Some of them decided to go. None of them asked me for space on the U.S.
                    airlift, interestingly enough. Like so many Cambodians, they figured that they
                    were small enough fish that they would survive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: They didn't. Well, her father didn't, nor did her mother. All of her
                    sisters and brothers but one wound up on the Thai-Cambodian border, where I
                    found them in '79 and took them to the refugee camp inside Thailand that the UN
                    was running. Many of them are here. Others are in Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went off in a helicopter. How did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Marines came in from the USS Okinawa, a battalion landing team, to secure
                    the airfield, which was a field not too far from the embassy near some civil
                    servant housing. When we finished off the last destruction - everybody had at
                    most a file drawer with a couple inchewe got all of our telephone locator pads,
                    remembered to throw those away, too, and they were burned, took the flag down,
                    tried to get the shield down but couldn't do it, it was too firmly in, so we
                    left the shield. Dean got the flag. I did some pictures eventually printed with
                    the story in the Department of State Newsletter about a month or 2 later,
                    including one of Dean with the flag. We piled into vehicles and drove up to the
                    field and boarded the CH53s and went off to the Okinawa, which then steamed for
                    Thailand. We got off at Utapao the next morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I stayed in Bangkok for a couple of months processing Cambodians out of
                    the consular section. It was wild and wooly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, was this when the reports came in
                        about what the Khmer Rouge?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Not yet, although just before I left Thailand to go off to Cornell for my
                    academic year, a refugee, Sin Mao, appeared at the consulate. I was brought in?
                    He had been in the United States, and had gone back to try to get his family
                    out, which he did. They walked out. I sat down with him and said, “Okay, what
                    happened?” He gave me chapter and verse. I did a cable on it which included the
                    evacuation of Phnom Penh, the fact that there were checkpoints at least on the
                    route he took-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the- (end of tape)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You were talking to this Cambodian who said the Khmer Rouge had ordered the
                    complete evacuation of Phnom Penh.</p>
                <p>CARNEY: What they had said was that “You can go back to your native village.” So,
                    if you were an ethnic Cambodian, you almost surely had at least your
                    grandparents from a particular native village. This particular refugee figured
                    it out, and he said that his particular native village was in the far northwest
                    of the country near the Thai border. He was moved out of town north across the
                    Mekong in the direction of Kompong Cham. It was there at a ferry point that the
                    Khmer Rouge gave little half sheets of paper that had mimeographed
                    fill-in-the-blank portions on it. In the upper left hand corner was a rather
                    interesting logo. In Cambodian, it read something that roughly translates,
                    “Exodus Reception Committee.” You filled out what your name was, who was with
                    you, and where you were going. That was your pass to get to the villages. That
                    was Khmer Rouge policy to take the new people from the cities and to deposit
                    them in the village and to build or forge them into a modern Cambodian communist
                    man or woman. Well, this fellow was aware that it was at that point that former
                    military were separated out and he assumed executed. He carried on and heard
                    several other stories of these executions and got out. That was the first solid
                    report on what was happening with the people after the Khmer Rouge victory. It
                    was several months later when you began to get more refugees coming to Thailand
                    talking about all the horrors that we now know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got to Thailand, what was our policy towards
                        Cambodian refugees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was in flux. It was basically? We weren't quite sure what to do, so we
                    put them all in a camp. You heard about former employees, people who were coming
                    over, government officials who made it out in their helicopter lift, people who
                    came in by boat from the seacoast of Cambodia, and then people started making
                    their way across the border. Then you had the refugee lift with the initial wave
                    and then we begaand I was out of it at that point, out of direct contact with
                    ithen we established our refugee policies, who was a refugee and who wasn't and
                    that sort of thing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was. Early on I gave a lecture to the Southeast Asia crowd. You had
                    had two Cornell turkeys, D. Gareth Porter and George Hildebrand, who had quickly
                    written a book called Cambodia: Starvation and Revolution arguing that the Khmer
                    Rouge had evacuated the cities to take the people to the food. It was such a
                    piece of nonsense, but it was warmly welcomed in the conclusions and logic
                    embraced by all of these people who had no judgment, much less any history
                    related to Cambodia. It began to become increasingly clear by the end of 1975
                    that something was wrong in Cambodia.</p>
                <p>I decided that for the second semester I would do a monograph as part of the
                    modern Southeast Asia history course I took under Prof. David Wyatt. I can't
                    tell you how many hours I put in on it. It's unreal. I'd do my classes, and then
                    I'd go in and wrestle with these translations and then do the library research
                    to get a background on Cambodian left-wing politics including microfiche of
                    Cambodian newspapers. Cornell is a wonderful resource in that way. I gave the
                    draft as my final paper for that course. I got an A. I went back to become
                    number 2 at Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodian Affairs in Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Cornell, were you up against the Cornell establishment
                        in Southeast Asian studies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No. George Kahin was not in residence. I don't know how he would have
                    reacted. Ben Anderson was very correct. The graduate students there, a couple of
                    them were delightful people. Jon Wiant would be a very good person to talk to.
                    He's basically in INR now. He was there studying Burmese affairs. Bill O'Malley
                    was there studying Indonesia. Bill lives in Australia now. I think he works for
                    the Australian intelligence analytical wing that Milton Osborne used to be part
                    of. I can't remember the name of it. There were a number of other people,
                    including Stephen Heder, who had evacuated with his first wife and was getting a
                    Ph.D. Steve was still a lefty in those days. It took him a while to swing from
                    the far left back to center, which he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that your courses were taught by?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Nothing of the sort. It was a university. I was taking Southeast Asian
                    art from Stanley J. O'Connor, a terrific course. The Johnson Museum there at
                    Cornell has got quite a good collection. You can put your hands on an Angkor era
                    bronze and stone and Indonesian art from Majapahit all the way down to
                    Srivijaya, and other art, including ceramics, from Vietnamese surroundings. That
                    was enormously valuable. Professor O.W. Walters was doing the ancient Southeast
                    Asian history course. He had been a Japanese prisoner in Singapore during the
                    unpleasantness and was a terrific historian, really solid. I did Frank Golay's
                    course in developmental economics, very valuable. Wyatt did the seminar in
                    Southeast Asian history in the second semester. He, too, is a professional
                    focused on history. I didn't do anything in the government department. I decided
                    that was pointless. That's where Kahin was. I did take though the graduate
                    course in? There was a graduate seminar in Southeast Asian history that Ben
                    Anderson taught which included what happened in Indonesia in '65.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Not particularly, no. I just disagreed with people. They knew it. When I
                    gave my lecture on what happened when the Khmer Rouge took over, I astonished
                    people by whipping out a copy of this mimeographed form, because nobody yet had
                    had a copy of it except within U.S. government circles. This made people say,
                    “See, it really was organized.” Well, yes, there was an effort to organize it.
                    But the fact that they did it, however inadequately organized, was what was at
                    issue. And there was one sort of dyed in the wool anti-war activist there who
                    would occasionally call up Cora Weiss and say, “He said it again.” But everybody
                    knew her and she was kind of a truculent individual who was playing with part of
                    a deck. She was indulged. I indulged her, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everybody understood where she was coming from.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Exactly. And that she wasn't that smart because, as the Russians put it,
                    “The roof has slipped.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is a good place to stop. We're in 1975. Is
                        there anything else we should talk about at Cornell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Let's pick that up next time. This must have been a very difficult time for your
                    wife, wasn't it?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: We were in the process of separating, so, yes, it was even more
                    difficult. But she was living with one of her brothers in a flat in Paris. We
                    were arguing about whether she ought to stay there or come to the U.S.</p>

                </p>
                <p>We'll pick this up next time. Was there anything left of the peace movement at
                    Cornell after this?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: There wasn't, nor was there much left in the way of joy at the? There was
                    actually. There was a Cambodian fellow from an organization based in the U.S.
                    called GKRAM. That expanded to “Group of Khmer Residents in America. It was an
                    acronym for support for the opposition to Lon Nol and his government. He gave a
                    talk at Cornell. It was he and a Vietnamese named Ngo Vin Long. Long was your
                    typical slick Vietnamese in his tweed jacket and his tie and here was this
                    Cambodian, the foil for the Vietnamese - they were both left-wingerin his
                    leather jacket and an open shirt explaining how he had helped do propaganda for
                    FUNK, Sihanouk's united front, and that he was planning to return to Cambodia.
                    He did and he ended up dead. He was not in accordance with what the Khmer Rouge
                    wanted. That was the sole period that I saw joy in victory by the opponents of
                    the United States in Indochina.</p>

                        think there was a certain amount of self-interest.</hi>

                <p>Today is September 25, 2002. 1976. The bureau was called EA in those days?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, East Asia.</p>
                <p>Q: And you were dealing with Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Your boss was Jim
                    Rosenthal?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: That's right.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who else above him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Bob Miller. Art Hummel was the assistant secretary. But there was a
                    transition period. '76 was an election year. In January of '77 or shortly there
                    afterwards, Dick Holbrooke came in as assistant secretary. Bob Oakley was the
                    DAS. He did Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this work in the EA bureau from '76 to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: 1978. Then I started to learn Thai and went to Udorn. In late '78, I
                    arrived in Udorn. That meant until about January '78 I was in the EA/VLC. It was
                    January of '78 that I went to Thai language training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You covered what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Basically the most important thing we covered was the potential opening
                    of relations with Vietnam. Jimmy Carter announced as a policy that the U.S.
                    should have diplomatic relations with every country. One of the early efforts
                    was a meeting between Dick Holbrooke and a senior Vietnamese negotiator, maybe
                    Xuan Thuy, in Paris in March, April, or May of 1977 in an effort? I can remember
                    going with Dick to the Vietnamese embassy, which of course was shuttered,
                    photographing the whole place so that we would have a little archive to be able
                    to present to the Vietnamese side if we got that far, but we didn't. The first
                    thing the Vietnamese insisted on was $3.25 billion. This was the promise that
                    Richard Nixon had made as part of the first set of Paris talks which everybody
                    in the United States decided had been grossly overtaken by the events of the
                    Vietnamese communist victory in 1975. Raising that amount was a signal error by
                    Hanoi and it delayed establishing relations until 6 years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went there, you were dealing with Vietnamese
                        affairs. Were you picking up this as going to be a major theme? Or was this
                        something that sort of popped up at you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: In what sense?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you go with Dick Holbrooke, you had already been on
                        the desk for a while, 6 months, in looking through it, had this $3.25

                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>CARNEY: It came out of the blue. I was not at the time anything close to being a
                    specialist on thinking in Hanoi, although I acquired a little bit of
                    specialization when I subsequently was posted to Bangkok. I really didn't think?
                    I did not study Vietnamese before I went to Saigon for my first post back in
                    '67. I was amazed that they actually seriously raised the $3.25? It seemed to be
                    serious on their part. It wasn't just a tactic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like, “Okay, we'll get that, but you've got to
                        give us this.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Exactly. It really seemed to be serious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we react?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There was instant congressional action. It might even have been an
                    amendment to legislation that we would not pay it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at the negotiating table-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I was in Washington. Jim Rosenthal was with Dick in Paris. There were a
                    number of meetings and they just simply couldn't move the Vietnamese. Let me
                    recall where the Woodcock Commission fit in this. The related significant
                    development was Leonard Woodcock's leading a commission to Vietnam. He also
                    tried to visit Cambodia. In Beijing, the Cambodians returned unopened the U.S.
                    request for-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the Cambodians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was the Khmer Rouge at this point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't imagine that you felt much was going to
                        happen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No. In fact, I can recall I was called down to make a few comments on
                    Cambodia as the Woodcock Commission was getting underway. I simply don't have
                    any dates for you. I think it was before the talks in Paris. It was that
                    commission which essentially opened the prospects for talks up. They asked me
                    about Cambodia. I said, “They're not going to welcome you. They're not even
                    going to respond to you.” It was clear? I was enough of a specialist on Cambodia
                    that I knew that the Khmer Rouge were simply not having anything to do with
                    anybody except the Chinese at that point. The decision was nevertheless to push
                    and try to open a channel with the Cambodians as well.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had Cambodia, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I was the Cambodia desk officer, but I was a de facto deputy in the
                    office. I did a lot of the drafting of the papers. You know how little it takes
                    to chuff junior officers. The action memo came back and had comments by
                    President Carter on it. Always nice to know the President's reading your
                    stuff.</p>
                <p>Q: What were we getting? Were we getting pretty good reports of what was
                    happening in Cambodia?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, we weren't. When I got back to Washington in '75, I had been in
                    Bangkok after the fall of Cambodia in April 1975, and I had had a chance to
                    interview some people who had made it out the following week. So, we already
                    knew that the evacuation of the cities was planned. This fellow gave me an
                    actual form that he had had to fill out from the Exodus Reception Committee. He
                    was clever enough to move all the way north. I had also talked to a couple of
                    other people who had made their way out. The station in Bangkok was getting some
                    reporting as well. All their networks were topsy turvy, if not destroyed, in the
                    Khmer Rouge emptying of the cities and the effective end of international
                    communication and travel within and to Cambodia. The CIA was just gearing up.
                    They had very few Cambodian speakers and were probably relying on the Thais for
                    what was actually happening in Cambodia.</p>
                <p>While I was at Cornell before joining the desk, I had produced a monograph of
                    just under 100 pages which was an identification of the people running Cambodia
                    as the Communist Party of Kampuchea. I traced what I was able to dig out of its
                    history back to the 1951 founding by the Vietnamese as the Cambodian People's
                    Revolutionary Party. Then I had gotten copies of one or 2 party youth magazines
                    and one or 2 party magazines that I translated at Cornell to produce the
                    monograph. But the key sources were 2 reports by the teachers who had rallied to
                    the government in 1973 after spending about 9 months in the bush with the Khmer
                    Rouge. They were appalled that there was a communist party. So we had a pretty
                    good idea of how bad things were. On the Hill, I backstopped Dick Holbrooke and
                    the fellow who was going to replace me, Charlie Twining, who was then the
                    Indochina watcher at the U.S. embassy in Bangkok. They appeared before the House
                    on what had been going on in Cambodia in '77 and it took a year to get those
                    talks underway.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: Not until '77. The press had begun to pick up in mid-late '76 but you
                    still got this argument from American academics. A 1975 book praised the Khmer
                    Rouge for taking the people to the food, arguing that you couldn't the get food
                    to the people. It was the most desperate nonsense by academics D. Gareth Porter
                    and George Hildebrand, neither one of whose reputations has survived intact as a
                    result of that absurdity.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having gone to Cornell in the belly of the beast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Their side had won.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing a series of apologetics coming out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: By '77, people who had any intellectual integrity at aland I can name one
                    of them: Dr. Stephen Heder, who is now at SOAS in London, who was in Cambodia
                    from '73 on, evacuated, went back to Cornell, had enough of an inquiring mind
                    and good sense that while he didn't rule out that something was going on there
                    that was bad, he was nevertheless, at least in the first year or so, more
                    willing to give the Khmer Rouge the benefit of the doubt. He subsequently, when
                    he himself had a chance to talk to Cambodian refugees and ultimately got an INR
                    contract to do sI was the managing officer for the contracchanged. But, he
                    didn't go 180 degrees to favor the Vietnamese as some of the Australian
                    academics did; for example, Ben Kiernan, now at Yale which has had the bad
                    judgment to give him tenure as a professor. Ben flipped 180 degrees because he
                    was totally a socialist. If one set of leftists weren't any good; to wit the
                    Khmer Rouge, then he flocked to the other set; to wit the Vietnamese. It was
                    just the most bizarre sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Q: I find it very hard to gain a great deal of respect for so much of the
                    academic community because it's playing with concepts. When you start doing that
                    without the real grounding of how things are done in the field? There are a lot
                    more grays, patterns don't work, models don't work.</p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes. You wind up compressing and skewing and filing the facts to fit your
                    model.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think this whole Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia
                        directorate? I would think there would be a real problem. These places,
                        except for Laos, you couldn't get to.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes. Laos, of course, had its own problem because there was a communist
                    government that took over there. The king of Laos was effectively in
                    reeducation. He died there. The Thais had the interest in Laos and certainly
                    didn't want the Vietnamese to continue to hold the whip hand there. I visited
                    Laos in '76 after I did Cornell. I went up to Vientiane, actually had lunch with
                    one of the Soviet diplomats, the fellow whom I described in our previous chat as
                    having located a Cambodian-French dictionary from the '30s when we met in Phnom
                    Penh. He didn't hold much stock in the Lao as effective managers, much less as
                    communists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it Laos had almost disappeared from everything
                        since the takeover practically.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, it's still one of the few communist governments left in the world,
                    but it's responded to the U.S. concerns on prisoners of war and missing in
                    action. There is now a bridge the Australians built across the Mekong from
                    Thailand. The last ambassador there was Wendy Chamberlain. She is now back here
                    as well, having left Pakistan because she couldn't have her kids with her.</p>
                <p>The only thing I can remember from that period on the desk was the Woodcock
                    Commission, negotiations with Vietnam that didn't go anywhere, and the beginning
                    of interest in the public at large, notably in Congress as well, on the terrible
                    situation the Khmer Rouge were creating in Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm trying to get your feeling about this. It's a cause.
                        It's almost a cult: the missing in action. You must have gotten involved in
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I did, but this was not a huge issue at that particular time. As the
                    League of Families of Prisoners of War/Missing in Action got organized, and with
                    the politics of the issue in Washington, when I came back from Indonesia in
                    1990, the issue was completely and thoroughly joined. When I wound up on the NSC
                    staff, I had particular responsibility for that as director for Asian Affairs
                    (Southeast Asia). I essentially replaced one of the gurus of that movement,
                    Richard Childress, an Army officer. At the time, it was not that much of an
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you feel and then maybe others around you feel
                        that there were prisoners of war sitting off in bamboo cages somewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No. We assumed that everybody was dead or had defected if there were any
                    live Americans there. Richard Garwood when he surfaced essentially confirmed
                    that.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It never made sense to me why? What was in it for anybody
                        on the Vietnamese side of keeping people hidden? But it became a cult
                        really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: To a degree, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, you had in the truest sense sort of a watching
                        brief on these countries. There wasn't a hell of a lot we could do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Exactly. Of course, we had implemented sanctions, both foreign assets
                    control and a trade embargo, on all or was Laos not under such heavy sanctions?
                    Certainly Cambodia and Vietnam were. I don't remember the status of Laos. We
                    still had an embassy in Vientiane with a charg� d'affaires.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when the Chinese-Vietnamese war went
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I was in Thailand as consul in Udorn. This was in response to the
                    Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in late '78/early '79.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were there when that happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I was in Udorn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There isn't much else to talk about, is there? What was
                        your impression of when Dick Holbrooke took over the bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>CARNEY: There was a lot of glamour there. His wife at the time was Blythe Babyak,
                    (everyone got married having relationships got married if they wanted a senior
                    position in Carter's administration). Part of the glamour was wisps of scandal
                    and what have you. Ms. Babyak fueled all of this by an article she wrote. I can
                    still remember the lead sentence, which is brilliant: “There is plenty of sex in
                    Washington, DC, but the only romance is with power.” That says it extremely
                    well.</p>
                <p>Dick had enormous energy. This was before computers. You'd go to see him and he'd
                    be sitting there typing a little note out to the secretary. He'd be on the phone
                    at the same time and then talking to you. That's the quintessential Dick
                    Holbrooke, whom over the years I've come to know a lot better, and to admire for
                    imagination and determination and sheer toughness. Not only did we work
                    together? I remember doing the briefing book for him for the House Committee
                    appearance on the situation in Cambodia. I had failed to put an index in it. It
                    was the first briefing book I had ever done. Remember, I'm a field mouse. I'd
                    never served much and never wanted to in Washington. As soon as he said it, I
                    said, “Got ya.” I got it back to him within an hour and a half or so with a
                    proper index. I can remember being in the first row as he and Charlie twining
                    were testifying. A question would come up and it would be the usual: “Flip,
                    flip, flip,” and then he'd have the text and he would draw from it. He never
                    bothered to read it. He would put his own ideas and experience in, having been
                    an old Vietnam hand himself. Smart. Active. Had the bureau firmly on the map.
                    But completely the opposite of an Art Hummel. He wasn't as measured in any way.
                    Perhaps to this day Dick can never be described as “measured”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After 2 years, you went off to Thai training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I went off to Thai language. I had to get a 3 in speaking in 6 months and
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: They really wanted somebody to replace John Finney, who had been my
                    predecessor as consul in Udorn for the northeast of Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Thai?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Actually pretty easy. There are no more violent diphthongs in Thai than
                    there are in Cambodian. The Thai was grammatically pretty forward. Cambodian and
                    Thai have a lot of cognates borrowed back and forth from each other as well as
                    from Sanskrit and Pali. Thai is a lot easier to read because you don't do
                    stacked consonants the way you do in Cambodian. The only difference is, Thai has
                    tones, but the tones are regular. If you see a Thai word written, you
                    immediately know what the tone is once you internalize the grammar of tones, as
                    it were. But I never got to speak Thai as well as I speak Cambodian partly
                    because there are so many English speakers in Thailand. I couldn't pretend, as I
                    did in Cambodia, that I didn't speak the major European language. I pretended I
                    didn't speak French in Cambodia. I couldn't do that with English in
                    Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Udorn. You were there from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: About August of '78 until I was effectively transferred to the political
                    section in Bangkok in about '80. But in practice, I was in Udorn a little less
                    than a year because the Vietnamese kicked the Khmer Rouge out to the malarial
                    and insalubrious Thai-Cambodian border region, and Mort Abramowitz, who was
                    ambassador in Bangkok then, asked me to come down and take, not exactly
                    residence on the Thai-Cambodian border, but spend 3-4 days a week out there to
                    find out what was going on inside Cambodia. I wasn't doing refugees. It was
                    basically Cambodian internal politics. By then, Desaix Anderson had replaced
                    Charlie Twining as the Indochina watcher in the political section in
                    Bangkok.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Udorn. First, were you married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I was separated at the time and in the process of divorce.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Udorn the year you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It had been a major American base. There was a huge signals intercept
                    station there known as the Elephant Corral, one of those circular antenna arrays
                    that really does look like a miniature stadium. There had been an Air America
                    facility there. CIA had a huge operation out of there. The base did not have
                    U.S. bombers or jets. It was regarded as not close enough to Vietnam. Those
                    bases were over in Nakon Phanom and Ubon, both of which were in the consular
                    district.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>It was 16 provinces that I covered with 15-16 million people. Poor. The
                    predominant image of the entire area was twofold. Trucks with big dirty balls of
                    string, which was kenaf, that was grown for its fiber to be made into ropes. You
                    would see the kenaf being retted, soaked in water, until the connective tissues
                    dissolved and then they were made into these huge dirty balls of string. The
                    second thing you would see were concrete aprons with chips of “monsamparang,”
                    cassava, being dried out so that the prussic acid content would vanish and then
                    it would be pelletized into animal feed for export mainly to Europeans. Those
                    were very predominant images.</p>
                <p>Glutinous rice was the staple, although there was plenty of number one long grain
                    and white rice grown as well in the region. Silks? The southern border tier of
                    the region was along the northern border of Cambodia and had been part of the
                    Cambodian Empire. You'd see Cambodian style temples from the Angkor period
                    scattered throughout that part of northeast Thailand and some even further. The
                    empire extended as far as Luang Prabang further north in Laos in its glory
                    days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a Vietnam boundary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No. Laos. The tri-border area was Laos, Cambodia, Thailand. We also had 3
                    refugee camps, one for hill tribe people in the extreme northwestern part of the
                    region, the part that abuts the north of Thailand where Chiang Mai is the
                    regional capital effectively. Then there were two camps for ethnic Lao.</p>
                <p>Q: How was the area adjusting to the fact that the Americans and the GIs and all
                    had pulled out? This was a tremendous investment and all of a sudden the guys
                    aren't going out to the?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was an interesting problem because it was Dan O'Donahue- (end of
                    tape)</p>
                <p>The adjustment of the region to the pullout of the American presence was ongoing.
                    We actually closed our information center in Khon Kaen, where the regional
                    university was located towards the second year of my incumbency in Udorn. It
                    turns out that, ironically enough, road building was the economic key. The
                    developmental economists would argue that they had predicted it. The northeast
                    of Thailand was not only a base area for prosecuting the war against Vietnam, it
                    was also a center of Thai communist insurgency. There was thus a focus on
                    building up road networks that would give the military access to the areas of
                    danger, and the economic benefit of that was derived because they opened all
                    that area up to the market. So, all those dirty balls of string and all that
                    cassava essentially helped add to the regional income in a way that brought
                    about enough prosperity to undermine the communist party of Thailand completely.

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there fighting going on while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: By the CPT? Yes. They were still fighting with the government on a very
                    small scale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Thai army as a fighting
                        force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The northeast had a major regional Thai army headquarters at Sakhon
                    Nakon, which was between Udorn City and Nakhon Phanom. It also had a major sub
                    regional headquarters that built up after 1979 in Surin, a Thai-Cambodian border
                    province, heavily ethnic Cambodian where there is an elephant roundup every year
                    in October or November as the dry season begins.</p>
                <p>I got to know the Thai army pretty well after '79, as I was going along the
                    Thai-Cambodian border. One of the things I would do would be to stick my head
                    into a Thai military post, which was usually company level, and I had enough
                    Thai, although I confess it wasn't good enough as I'd have liked. I'd get into
                    these camps and find an enormous suspicion, so thick you could cut it with a
                    knife. It would take me about 15 minutes of just talking and smiling and joking,
                    dealing with English, finding out where people were from in Thailand, whether
                    they had ever been to training in the U.S. at Fort Benning, advanced infantry or
                    something like that, to break that ice and establish my own bona fides after
                    which I could drop in anytime. If the commander wasn't there, the deputy
                    commander wouldn't have any trouble talking with me. I found they were generally
                    militarily ready. They had pretty good equipment and communications.</p>
                <p>But every now and then I would uncover a very bizarre reality. For example, at
                    one base, I came in, and saw they had brand new U.S. made 106 millimeter
                    recoilless rifles. That's a very fine weapon. We knew that there were Vietnamese
                    tanks on the other side of the border and the 106 will do a number on any tank
                    the Vietnamese could get up to the border, often a PT76 amphibious model or
                    sometimes a T55, which I think is the Chinese made copy of the T54. I carried a
                    copy of one of those little booklets on weapons of the communist world just so I
                    could identify things if I came across them because I had never been in the U.S.
                    military. I said to the captain commanding the base, “You've got the new 106s.”
                    He said, “We can't use them.” I said, “Why not?” He said, “You see this little
                    barrel alongside the 106 barrel?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “That's a .50 caliber
                    machinegun barrel and there is a particular spotting round that is used for
                    that. We can't spot, so there is no point wasting 106 ammunition if we're not
                    sure where we're shooting.” That duly appeared in my next cable. The next thing
                    I know, the Defense attach�, who was insufficiently diligent in being out at
                    border where the threat actually was - I would have thought those attach� guys
                    would have been all over that border - They weren't.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Of course, as soon as the Pentagon read that, their immediate cable out to the
                    DATT was, “No 106 spotting rounds? How Please” There was a JUSMAG that was part
                    of the U.S. mission there that got the more serious question from whatever the
                    Defense entity is that does such procurement and assistance. That was amazing. I
                    can remember a cable?</p>
                <p>Basically the Thais felt the threat. It is particularly the case that that part
                    of the border around the town of Aranyaprathet, which means “Forest Country” in
                    Sanskrit, is a traditional invasion route between Cambodia and what's now
                    Thailand. The armies at Angkor Wat conquered the Mon by moving through what's
                    called the Watana Gap. It's great tank country for the most part. The escarpment
                    comes around across the northern border of Cambodia with Thailand. Then there is
                    a set of hills that come up from the south. Then you've got the gap. The town of
                    Aranyaprathet is right in the middle of it. It's a clear shot to Bangkok. We
                    used to argue the only thing that would stop Vietnamese tanks if they rolled
                    would have been the Bangkok traffic. (Ambassador) Mort Abramowitz was trying to
                    get the U.S. to commit to refurbishing and delivering some of our older tanks,
                    the M48A5. He wasn't getting anything. He got commitments in principle, but no
                    delivery date, no numbers, no nothing. He finally got annoyed and sent a cable
                    ouI still remember it to this da“I'm going to see Prime Minister Prem tomorrow
                    morning. He's going to ask me about the tanks. Do I give him the same old crap
                    or are you going to get me an answer?” Outstanding! And he got his answer:
                    “Yes,” including such and such delivery dates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the feeling that there was a threat to Thailand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There were 2 aspects of the threat. One was the potential military
                    threat. You knew Vietnamese capabilities. We didn't have any idea what their
                    intentions were. My own view was that the Vietnamese would not be coming across
                    that border, that it was entirely too much for them to bite off, and that
                    strategically they were looking to consolidate an Indochinese federation,
                    something that had been their goal since the '30s, and intimidate Thailand,
                    which they thought they were capable of doing. They believed the Thais were
                    perfect subjects for intimidation.</p>
                <p>But there was also the refugee issue. There were huge numbers of Cambodians,
                    200,000-500,000, who had fled to the Thai-Cambodian border and were in makeshift
                    camps all up and down the border, some of them disguised as refugee camps were
                    in fact Khmer Rouge-controlled populations from which they drew their own
                    recruits and rations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to go back to Udorn. What was the consulate
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>CARNEY: The consulate was doing a combination of classic consular thingSocial
                    Security checks, protection and welfare, a crazy American lady in the brown
                    dress whom we finally got out of our consular district to Bangkok.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The Russians have introduced me to this wonderful phrase: roof has
                    slipped. She just wasn't all there. There were Americans who had retired from
                    the Air Force mainly who were married to Thais. They were getting checks. They
                    were dying. Work with their effects and what have you. There were some visa
                    issues. We issued non-immigrant visas. Then there was the whole question of
                    reporting on the insurgency. There was a branch of the station in Udorn. There
                    was a whole refugee operation that we helped monitor. AID was still involved. It
                    hadn't yet drawn down and disappeared from Thailand. There were AID projects
                    going on. I had a small self-help fund that I administered. Then there were the
                    whole refugee questions as well as watching what was going on in Cambodia from
                    refugees from Cambodia who made it into northeast Thailand. Then there was the
                    question of the internal politics of the northeast as they bore on Thai national
                    politics. It's always been a volatile area both in terms of politics and food
                    due to poverty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of government did Thailand have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: One of the Pramot brothers, either Seni or Kukrit, was prime minister.
                    There were 2 or 3 coups when I was there, one of which failed, a military
                    coup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you're having the coup a month type government, the
                        politics of what's happening up in Udorn don't make a lot of difference, do
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, the coups didn't succeed. That's what was interesting, that
                    Thailand was emerging from that coup a month period into what it is today, which
                    is much more stable and electoral.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our estimate at the time of the communist
                        insurgency? Who was sparking it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was basically pro-Chinese. But my memory is not? I wound up doing that
                    aspect of Thailand for a little less than a year. Then I moved almost full-time
                    to Bangkok to do Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was not the equivalent of the Viet Cong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Absolutely not. It was too small.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was more an irritant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was a little more than that, and it was a matter of great public
                    debate as well. There is lot of leftism in Thai intellectual thought generated,
                    to some degree, in response to all the right-wing activity of the Thai military,
                    and given currency by the excesses of the Thai military right-wing side and the
                    political right-wing as well. The Thai king presides over it all and had gained
                    the stature sufficient to keep things from getting out of hand, as he did. The
                    king was directly involved in making sure one of the coups for sure did not
                    succeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the military had a heavy hand or did they
                        seem to know what they were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: They were entirely too heavy-handed. There wasn't enough of the J5 civic
                    action aspect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move on. You really began from about '79 on to work
                        with political reporting along the border.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Mort Abramowitz sent me to Aranyaprathet in September '79.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were involved with this until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I replaced Desaix Anderson in the political section as the Indochina
                    watcher, so it would have been until May or so of '83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation on the border?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There was a certain amount of tension because the Vietnamese intentions
                    weren't known. That eased as the Vietnamese began to withdraw their troops out
                    of Cambodia. At the same time, the refugee crisis continued. Mrs. Carter
                    visited. We had 2 congressional delegations in '79 that visited Cambodia
                    traveling through Bangkok. Senators Danforth, Baucus, and Sasser, the last the
                    leader of the delegation in about August of '79; and then a women's
                    congressional delegation mixed American and Australian visited about a month and
                    a half later. I was essentially staff/language facilitator for both of those
                    trips.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>You saw the international effort inside Cambodia led by UNICEF and the
                    International Committee of the Red Cross begin to address questions of famine
                    inside Cambodia. You had an enormous effort to send seed and food, rice seed and
                    milled rice, across the Thai-Cambodian border at Aranyaprathet. Then you had
                    people coming in and out including one defector, Dy Lamthol, whom I had met in
                    the foreign ministry when I was with Senator Sasser's delegation. He wound up on
                    the border. You slowly began to get a U.S. effort together with the coalescing
                    non-communist Cambodian resistance, one side led by people like Prince Sihanouk,
                    the other non-communist side more republican under the leadership of the late
                    Sonn Sann. It was a complex?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've talked to people who have been involved with this who
                        have said that the Khmer Rouge was the only real fighting force and that the
                        other groups that were palatable to us, non-communist groups, really weren't
                        very effective and so whom do you arm if you want to get this Vietnamese
                        dominated government out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: What happened was, the Chinese and the Thais made sure that the Khmer
                    Rouge were armed. We, the Malaysians, and Singaporeans made sure that both of
                    the non-communist sides were armed and trained, including 3 training camps in
                    Malaysia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we then work to keep them fighting each other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: They had their own working relationship. They had established a coalition
                    largely under Malaysia, Singapore, and Thai insistence. It was that coalition
                    and all this was pretty well described in the books by Elizabeth Becker and
                    Nayan Chanda. That kept the pressure on. The Vietnamese, once the Soviet Union
                    collapsed, were under pressure from the Chinese that included an unsuccessful
                    invasion. Nevertheless, victory or not, the Vietnamese were aware that their
                    northern neighbor was interested and serious, and essentially Hanoi had to come
                    to terms, which happened in the early '90s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about '79 to '83.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: That was the period in which the organizational structure of a Cambodian
                    resistance coalesced. It became clear then that the Vietnamese could not succeed
                    in establishing a client regime in Phnom Penh that would itself be able to deal
                    with the Khmer Rouge and the non-communists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our policy such as it was, we did not want to see a

                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>CARNEY: That's correct.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be a Vietnamese Indochina.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes. We were essentially in support of the Thais on this because Thailand
                    was then a treaty ally. In fact, it still is. The Manila Pact was not informally
                    dissolved yet. At the same time, there was a lot of animus still towards any
                    Vietnamese objectives. It was assumed correctly that they were against U.S.
                    interests.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in strategic negotiations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I had a serious disagreement. Burt Levin was the DCM. Mort Abramowitz was
                    the ambassador. Burt and I disagreed on whether the U.S. ought to support the
                    non-communist resistance. It went as far as a draft dissent cable that Mort
                    Abramowitz looked at and said, “Let's see if we can't work this out.” Jim
                    Wilkinson, who was then political counselor, did a little bit of drafting magic
                    to get the cable out as a front channel cable rather than a dissent.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: Which is why Jim recast it slightly but left the essence of it intact,

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: U.S. support for the non-communist resistance, military. Burt Levin
                    didn't believe it was worth doing, didn't believe they could ever be effective
                    nor that it was in U.S. interests to do so.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there concerns about supporting this non-communist
                        group that you might be encouraging a group of people to stick their nose
                        up? The 2 most powerful forces there are the Cambodian backed
                        Vietnamese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: That was not a powerful force. That was a Cambodian? It went through
                    several changes of name. Let's call it the Cambodian People's Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Hun Sen was the foreign minister then. It was even before he became prime
                    minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have that on one side. You've got the Khmer Rouge on
                        the other. These nice guys are in the middle. They would strike me as being
                        exposed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The nice guys though could handle the Phnom Penh forces. They couldn't
                    handle the People's Army of Vietnam. But the People's Army was beginning to pull
                    out.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself involved in negotiating, helping,
                        the forces? What are we going to call these people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: We used their names. Sonn Sann's people were the Cambodian People's
                    National Liberation Front, KPNLF. Sihanouk's people ultimately became the ANS,
                    the Arm�e Nationale Sihanoukiste. I didn't wind up doing the actual help. That
                    was run in a combination of AID, CIA programs. In Washington, retired is David
                    Merrill, who ran that for AID. He is a former ambassador to Bangladesh and was
                    an AID person. He works for Nathan Associates at this point.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I had a reporting brief, but I would stick a nose into policy when it
                    seemed that things weren't going in the direction that they could or that would
                    serve a broader goal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You describe yourself in Washington as a field mouse,
                        somebody who likes to go out. Here you weren't a Bangkok mouse, but again
                        you were a field mouse. You were out there. Did you find yourself in
                        conflict with the city slickers back in our embassy in Bangkok? Were they
                        seeing the same thing you were?</hi>

                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>CARNEY: The disagreement I had with Burt Levin was the only one I can remember of
                    any significance. Burt had never served in Vietnam and had his own views of the
                    direction things ought to go. I think he might have been more of an odd person
                    out on what ought to happen in Indochina, certainly farther out than Mort
                    Abramowitz was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your relations with the NGOs who were
                        working with the refugees? They have their own caste and there was quite an
                        establishment there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There was a huge establishment. Some of them thought I was a spook.
                    Others for the most part, some of whom I had worked with in the refugee camp for
                    Lao in Nong Khai, essentially knew where I was coming froInternational Rescue
                    Committee, people like that. Medecins Sans Frontiers, because I speak French, I
                    got along well with them. The director there was Claude Malhurin, who wound up
                    as a secretary of state in France at one point. I don't remember his portfolio
                    exactly. They knew I was with the embassy. I would drive one of those big white
                    Australian made Chevrolets. There was a big U.S. effort on the border. There was
                    a separate refugee section that Lionel Rosenblatt was running. Mike Eiland was
                    his deputy. A pretty good relationship. See each other, talk. None of these
                    refugee entities spoke Cambodian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself dragged in again and again for
                        issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No. I'd often be dragged in just for what's going on more than anything
                    else. Whenever Mort would take anybody to the border, and he took a lot of
                    people, including EU commissioners like Madame Agnelli and some of the
                    ambassadors, he came up with Marshall Sitthi, the Thai foreign minister then,
                    and I wound up doing a three way translation in English, Cambodian, and Thai,
                    which was very difficult. I was a resource person because I had so much
                    background in Cambodia and acquired a huge background in Vietnam. As Desaix
                    left, I wound up with Ed McWilliams as second man in the external unit. Ed was
                    subsequently involved in the Afghanistan thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved with Rosalyn Carter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Oh, yes, because of her visit, I went up with the advance team to advance
                    the sites that she was going to including the refugee camp at Sakao, which was
                    Khmer Rouge-controlled villagers. Then she went to the Phu Phan Palace in
                    Northeast Thailand. The Thai king has palaces in all the regions. She showed up
                    for lunch there with the king.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you with the visit when she went?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, I was wandering around as a potential resource but never did
                    anything as I recall. I took some pictures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern about these camps, that the Khmer Rouge
                        was getting too powerful in them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I frankly had less focus on what was going on in the camps. What I was
                    looking for were people who were new, could tell me what was going on inside
                    Cambodia, crops or politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you picking up about Cambodia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: That there was clearly an effort to create a Cambodian government. Even
                    before I went down to the border, I did an airgram from Udorn because I was
                    listening to Radio Phnom Penh. The airgram in early '79 set forth the structure
                    of the Cambodian government as it existed, showing that there were people who
                    had 3 or 4 different hats and people were moving from job to job. It hadn't yet
                    gelled but it was in the process. Who held what job, kind of a “Who's Who” of
                    Vietnamese-controlled Cambodia. Over the next year, I was able to establish that
                    the military had begun to gel itselstaff, equipment, training, that sort of
                    thing. This was all essentially drawing on FBIS, and then mixing it with
                    information from the people whom I interviewed. I did a piece in Asian Survey on
                    that at one point. My argument was that the Vietnamese had to create a
                    functioning Cambodian armed force that could deal with the non-communists and
                    the Khmer Rouge if they had any hope of a new version of the Indochina
                    Federation, one of voluntary participation rather than Vietnamese control. My
                    conclusion was that the verdict was out. I had my doubts, but it was something
                    everybody had to keep his eye on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way you had the absolutely horrendous, monstrous
                        regime of the Khmer Rouge so that when the Vietnamese came in, it was
                        certainly welcome and a lot better for humanity's sake.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>CARNEY: But they stayed too long. The problem was that there have always
                    historically been Cambodian suspicions of Vietnamese motives. The whole of South
                    Vietnam, at least up to just north of Saigon, was Cambodian at one point, called
                    even today, Kampuchea Krom, lower Cambodia. The Cambodians know that, and they
                    know the Vietnamese had designs on Cambodia. (They recall) that great period in
                    the 19th century when the Vietnamese had sent court dress for Ang Mai, the queen
                    of Cambodia. That Vietnamese effort was only halted by a serious Thai effort in
                    the 1830s and '40s. They had joint suzerainty at one point. As for the Thais,
                    it's more like family and cousins. The Vietnamese are just weird as far as
                    Cambodians are concerned. They don't fit. They aren't Theravada Buddhists for
                    one thing. And they have these weird Chinese customs.</p>
                <p>What happened inevitably and predictably? One of the reasons why I had currency
                    with the NGOs was because I was published on Cambodia. The monograph at Cornell
                    on the Cambodian communist party and Asian Survey, '80, '81 issues on Cambodia.
                    I was published on the substance of the issue.</p>
                <p>Q: I've talked to people who were in Thailand later on who said the NGOs who
                    dealt with refugees became very proprietary.</p>
                <p>CARNEY: Oh, they always do, of refugees. Like the NGOs that do wildlife: “our
                    elephants.” It's the same thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At a certain point, you want to stop people from being
                        refugees or screen them out, get them back in-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Which we did in Cambodia but that wasn't until the early '90s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You couldn't at this point, but were you seeing this
                        proprietary thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Oh, yes, inevitably. What impact did it have on policy? The whole focus
                    was humanitarian relief at that point. There wasn't much of a “Don't you dare
                    touch our refugees.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't any real alternative at this point, was
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were talking about a war going on. You couldn't force
                        people to go back.</hi>

                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, the Thais did, 30-40,000 in early '79, and the legacy of that -
                    people managed to work their way back to the border after a few monthwas
                    something that the embassies, including ours, were determined not to see
                    repeated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any other embassies involved in this process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The French to a big degree. A lot of Cambodians wound up in France. The
                    Europeans in general, lots of concern. The political side of it had the
                    Malaysians and the Singaporeans involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run across Malaysians and Singaporeans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: They were mainly dealing with the Agency. I would run across them because
                    they knew who I was from the publications. Every now and then I would run across
                    a Thai who would say, “But you don't deal with Cambodia. You're not with so and
                    so.” I said, “No, I'm on the diplomatic side.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting, there are a lot of people who did a lot
                        of reading about the area and there really wasn't much literature about
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There was a huge amount, but not always in English.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: Yes, we started sending people to Saigon for the interviews over there
                    while I was still in Bangkok. Otherwise I wouldn't know about it. If you gave me
                    a few names, I might remember who was doing it. They were part of the refugee
                    office. Or they might have been part of the consular section.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: No, except that the Chinese demonstrated their bona fides, and the Thais
                    were therefore encouraged in their cooperation with the Chinese to keep the
                    Khmer Rouge viable.</p>

                    him. Then John Gunther Dean replaced Mort. John Gunther Dean had been ambassador

                    Indonesia), Will Itoh. Thais are funny. Because they've never been colonized,
                    they have a different outlook. To get along with Thais at any level, you need a
                    Third World style. Dan O'Donahue is too irascible. Mort Abramowitz is too much
                    of a policy wonk. Dave Lambertson is too reserved and quiet. John Gunther Dean
                    was too bombastic. Will Itoh was basically too junior. Unger would have been the
                    name the Thais remember.</p>
                <p>The thing about the Third World is that you cannot pretend you're interested in
                    culture and geography and people and what's happening because most people in the
                    Third World are underemployed and have enough time that they do a lot of people
                    watching and your insincerity becomes manifest. So you can't be insincere on the
                    one hand, and if you're not generally interested, which lamentably the case for
                    too many senior? By the time you get to be that senior in the Foreign Service,
                    even your career people, there seems to be, unfortunately, a failing of all
                    those impulses that sent us abroad in the first place. I can remember, we were
                    up in northeast Thailand. We had gone to the Thai army command at Surin. We were
                    driving back to Bangkok, quite a long drive. We stopped at Phanom Rung, a
                    Cambodian temple site on a very high hill from which you can see right to the
                    edge of the escarpment south and then into Cambodia. We stopped and got grilled
                    chicken and sticky rice and some Thai som tam, the green papaya salad that can
                    be so spicy. Mort (Abramowitz) said, “You know, you young guys, you really
                    have?” He didn't say, “You have it made,” but it was a sentiment similar to
                    that. He himself wanted to be back in Bangkok thinking about policy and who to
                    talk to in Washington. It's unfortunate.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's one of the things I've found in this oral history
                        program. People say, “Well, you have to have somebody who is an ambassador
                        who did this.” When we first started this, we kind of skipped over the
                        junior years very quickly and moved up. Very quickly I realized that some of
                        the brightest thoughts, the best analyses of what was going on came from
                        people who did reach senior ranks but when they were younger they could get
                        out and around. When you get down to it, an ambassador is a prisoner there
                        and if he goes out he's a showcase; he's trotted around.</hi>

                        mid-career officer is out there, often doing a lot of the grunt work which
                        is the?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: A political counselor is the best job I ever had to get a feel for a
                    country. Oddly enough, in the Sudan, I was able to do more of that than I ought
                    to have been able to do because there was no staff (once the Americans were
                    drawn down and commuting from Nairobi). I actually wound up having to write the
                    Human Rights Report, the Political Reporting Plan, and all of that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: On the other hand, you've got a Paul Wolfowitz in Indonesia who was
                    absolutely brilliant and wife Claire, they're now separated. (She) had been an
                    American Field Service student in central Java. As I said to Paul one time,
                    “You're a first tour officer as ambassador. Your interest and enthusiasm for
                    Indonesia is palpable.” Indonesians responded to it. You got that fellow who had
                    been in Pakistan, who was before or just after Stape Roy, and the guy wasn't
                    interested and that conveyed itself. You lose an ability to communicate
                    especially in the Third World. In London or Paris or Bonn it still matters, as
                    that one politico who spoke French replacing Pamela Harriman? But basically in
                    the Third World you have to have it to be effective. With Thais, John Gunther
                    Dean was more effective than many even though he was always saying, “I did this
                    and I talked to that person and I saw the king more times than you did” and that
                    sort of thing because he was so interested that- (end of tape)</p>

                <p>CARNEY: My wife, Vicki, is from Spokane, a second marriage for me, first for her.
                    She went to Thailand as a Christian volunteer and taught English in Chiang Rai
                    in the northwest of Thailand and then moved down to Bangkok to teach English at
                    Chualongkorn University. She had just become a freelance journalist when I met
                    her in August of '78. After a few months, we started courting. When I went down
                    to Bangkok to do the Thai-Cambodian border, we became even closer and decided to
                    marry in May 1983. We did and then Vicki and I went to Pretoria, South Africa,
                    where I became political counselor in July of '83.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No because my second posting had been in Maseru, Lesotho, so I did have
                    the Southern Africa background. The Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, the
                    very sound and capable Chet Crocker, had his own candidate for political
                    counselor in Pretoria, but I had been promoted, had gotten the Director
                    General's award for reporting for my work in Thailand, and essentially Chet
                    didn't have his way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you feel that you had some fences to mend?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I knew that I had some fences to mend and did so first by inviting his
                    special assistant, Robert Cabelly, a complicated figure, to stay with us. He was
                    arriving in Pretoria on one of his regular visits about a month or 2 weeks after
                    Vicki and I arrived. We didn't have household effects. The welcome kit? We had
                    Robert stay with us and then did a dinner party the night after his arrival and
                    met some South Africans, some of whom are friends to this day.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Robert Cabelly? What was his role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>CARNEY: He had been in the private sector. I think he had worked for Goldfields
                    and was fairly well plugged in in aspects of Southern African society. Chet
                    Crocker found him very congenial as kind of a special assistant to do
                    imaginative memos, and to try to meet with people and find out what was going on
                    in ways Chet apparently felt he wasn't getting from either embassy or CIA
                    reporting. So Robert would come down. He'd talk to the head of the South African
                    Intelligence Service and to the security police and to Pan African Congress
                    types as well as a certain number of journalists and economic and financial
                    people. He was not viewed in any friendly manner by either the ambassador,
                    Herman Nickel, a political appointee and former “Time Life” executive and
                    reporter; who got kicked out of South Africa in the early '60s when he was the
                    Time bureau chief. The DCM thought I was unwise in inviting Robert to stay with
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Walter Stadtler.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Pretoria from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: '83 to '86. My personal portfolio was Namibian independence, so I was in
                    Windhoek every 6 to 8 weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in South Africa and Namibia at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There are 3 or 4 aspects of the situation there. There are 3 consulates
                    in the country: Durban, Johannesburg, and Capetown. Basically the marching
                    orders were to understand the Afrikaner and to work with the Afrikaner to see if
                    there wasn't scope to begin a movement away from apartheid. Two, you had an
                    ongoing civil war in Angola with a massive Cuban troop presence and the South
                    African role in support of (rebel) Jonas Savimbi. The object was to get rid of
                    the Cubans to try to bring about a resolution of the war. Three, Namibia, the
                    South Africans had refused in the late '40s to put Namibia, for which they were
                    the League of Nations mandatory, under the UN Trusteeship Council and had at
                    various times abortively tried to get Namibia absorbed as part of South Africa
                    itself. There was an active insurgency under Sam Nujomo, the current president.
                    We can talk about Sam's ambitions. Having just recently been in Namibia, I have
                    a good feel for it.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Then we had the issue of what was going on in black politics in South Africa
                    itself. Just as we got there, there was a constitutional referendum that opened
                    up parliament to participation by Indians and Coloreds, Coloreds being the mixed
                    race group. That ignited black South Africans, who were themselves divided in 3
                    groups. One would have been the ANC supporters through the United Democratic
                    Front. The others would have been those who totally rejected any possibility of
                    a white role in South Africa, the PAC or Pan African Congress. The ANC was
                    multiracial. The third was the group that was essentially Zulus, under not the
                    king but the effective prime minister, the hereditary prime minister of the
                    king, Gatsha Buthelezi, and his Inkatha Freedom Party. It was a very complex
                    internal racial, ethnic, political situation.</p>
                <p>You also had a complicated white political situation, but the bottom line in the
                    white political situation was, the Afrikaners were in charge and most of the
                    English speakers were glad of it. However much they babbled and wrote, they
                    didn't vote for highly Progressive Federal Party, that at that time was the main
                    white opposition in parliament.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Pretoria, which is a heart of
                        Afrikanerland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Exactly, but we spent every 6 months in Capetown when parliament sat.
                    There were a number of people on the embassy staff who moved from Pretoria to
                    Capetown with the ambassador and his secretary, DCM, and his secretary,
                    political counselor, and secretary, and one political officer.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk about Pretoria first. Was there almost a problem in dealing with
                    the Afrikaners? Were they politically in the U.S. being put beyond the pale?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, at the period we arrived, mid-'83, there was an era of good
                    feeling. The Afrikaners had accepted that Chet Crocker did not have horns and a
                    tail as they had initially been led to believe, partly by their supporters here
                    in the U.S. They saw Chet in particular working on the Angola question, which
                    was very much in their interests. On the Namibia question, there was a growing
                    consensus in South Africa that it would ultimately be independent. They were
                    hoping that they would set the terms for independence, and who would be in
                    charge and they were hoping that Dirk Mudge of the Republican Party and his
                    people would be the political majority there, that maybe they could even do a
                    deal that would effectively marginalize the Southwest African People's
                    Organization, SWAPO, that was actually fighting a low level insurgency with no
                    great success against South African troops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the South African government beginning to feel the
                        strain of supporting forces up in Angola and then fighting this low grade
                        war in Namibia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Not until 1984.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: You began the state of emergency in South Africa and black response to
                    the constitutional referendum and its outcome, and you began to see a more
                    effective Cuban-Angolan opposition to South African incursions into southern
                    Angola. The handwriting was pretty clearly on the wall in '84.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Afrikaners?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: My wife and I both found them serious, engaging, ruthless, but they had
                    the real interest. Except for the communists, entirely too many of the English
                    speakers were willing to exploit, enjoy, live well, and then run for home when
                    they ultimately would have to.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: We got into it immediately. The second night we were in Pretoria, we
                    drove to Johannesburg to go to a play at the Market Theater. It was “Master
                    Harold and the Boys.” Roger Daley and his wife, Dalene, were in Johannesburg at
                    the consulate. I had been at their wedding in Durban in 1969 when I was in
                    Lesotho and Roger was posted in Durban, so we had instant welcome and a set of
                    people who were not your normal embassy groupies. One of our earliest
                    experiences was at the State Theater in Pretoria where the Brit who was head of
                    Sigma Motors was there, basically told Vicki, “My dear, the only reason I'm here
                    is this is the best place in the world for a white man to be.” That kind of set
                    the tone for the experience.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: You'll find if you look at the 1950s volume of Foreign Relations of the
                    United States, that the apologetics we were using in South Africa, considering
                    our own racial situation in the U.S., were fairly torturous, very unconvincing.
                    I read the volume because we had them in the embassy. I would occasionally cite
                    from that as I was talking to South Africans.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: It was odd. The second or third day in the embassy, we were in the same
                    building that the South African security police was in. It was sort of an arcade
                    on the ground floor. I went down to have a wurst of some kind at Heinz and
                    Gertie's, a little stand in the arcade. I wandered out. I was walking along and
                    there was a shop window that attracted my eye, so I looked at it, and then I saw
                    that I could go around the corner because the window extended. I went around the
                    corner and said, “I think I'll wander in.” I turned back and came face to face
                    with this guy and he closed his eyes and shook his head and said, “Oh, shit.” He
                    was following me. He was one of the security police people following me. I just
                    smiled at him. He shook his head. My predecessor was the late Dennis Keogh.
                    Dennis was harassed by the security police from time to time. They never got to
                    where they harassed me, but my successor, the late Robert Frasure, was harassed
                    seriously. He laid himself open to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is it. Did you sort of set yourself off on a course
                        of saying? We were trying to be as open as possible and get out and meet as
                        many people, which I take it the South African government did not want us to
                        do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, actually, ultimately, whenever I went to talk to the military
                    people, there were always 2 of them. They ultimately made a decision? Cabelly
                    could never see anybody without Pik Botha's man for Angola and Namibia, with
                    whom I just stayed in Capetown, David Steward present. They basically decided
                    the Americans were learning too much about what was going on and that this was
                    they felt inimical to their efforts and interests and operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>CARNEY: I just did. I called people up and went over to see them, invited them
                    over to the house. We had a huge Thanksgiving dinner with usually 30-40
                    peoplblack South Africans, security/military South Africans, columnists; my
                    gunsmith was in one of them. I was deliberately trying to throw together a mix
                    as often as I could so that? We had one dinner party where we had Gaby Magemola
                    of Barclay's Bank and his wife. He was complaining, “Why can't I live in
                    Houghton?” He had a good bank job. The then wife of the group economist for
                    Standard Bank, Niko Czypionka, Lynette, said, “You know, you wouldn't want to
                    live there. The sand blows into your swimming pool all the time.” That kind of
                    conversation, as mindless as it sounds in this day and age, never took place in
                    any forum of South African society. Essentially the U.S. embassy was very active
                    in trying to get that sort of buzz going. All the members of parliament in
                    Capetown, we'd always be out with members of parliament. We were especially
                    active with USIS making sure that the IV program included members of parliament,
                    as many Afrikaners as possible to get them exposed to the U.S. If you look at
                    who, among Afrikaner politicians who were with DeKlerk in ending apartheid had
                    been on the IV program, you would agree it was a notable success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there problems with dealing with black Africans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There were. The consulate in Johannesburg was particularly jealous
                    because that was their role. But my deputy, Margaret, McMillion, who is now
                    ambassador in Rwanda, was the black politics officer in the political section in
                    Pretoria. I wouldn't hesitate to go see Bishop Tutu or Cyril Ramaphosa, then
                    labor leader, to go to some of the homelands to talk to the late Enos Mabusa, or
                    to go to Gatsha Buthelezi or Oscar Dhlomo in Zululand in Natal. But my own
                    portfolio was heavily concentrated in Namibia, and where I personally did black
                    politics was essentially there.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the situation in Namibia?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: Again, it was a South African effort. There was an Administrator General
                    who ran the place. There was a Southwest African Territorial Force that was
                    commanded by a South African defense force major or lieutenant general. There
                    were occasional incursions by SWAPO units across the Angolan border trying to
                    get into the farming areas for what we would call today terrorist activities. At
                    the same time, Windhoek was a charming, lively place with a very German air
                    about it. Lots of Germans balanced the Afrikaners off. Certain active politics
                    there, including an internal wing of SWAPO, whose leaders I would meet when I
                    went. We were part of something called a contact group of 5 countries. We would
                    have contact group meetings in the bubble in the U.S. embassy or its equivalent
                    French or British facility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there strict apartheid in Namibia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>CARNEY: No, there were plenty of people? There wasn't even strict apartheid in
                    South Africa. It was breaking down in South Africa, too. In fact, the Group
                    Areas Act went when we were there in 1986, something that opposition member of
                    parliament Helen Suzeman had fought in the 30-plus years she had been in
                    parliament. An Afrikaner National Party MP acknowledged it when the vote passed.
                    Albert Nothnagel allowed that it was a victory of the honorable member from
                    Houghton, Helen Suzeman, who had fought successfully against the act for her
                    entire parliamentary career. Things were breaking open. Washington couldn't see
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling the Washington pressures in which you had
                        on one side the conservative Republicans who were in command at this time
                        saying, “You know, it's good for business and let's not mess around in South
                        Africa?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: That was there, but there were U.S. sanctions. They started in '84.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this came more from the democratic side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It succeeded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you running into the contradictions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Black South Africa was saying, “Look, the U.S. administration is not
                    interested in us. It's only the Congress that's keeping your feet to the fire.”
                    And to a degree they were right. On the other hand, you then wound up with the
                    very unseemly spectacle of the Black Caucus in the U.S. taking responsibility
                    for the end of apartheid. I was there for thaMandela's election in '9which is
                    just ludicrous. It was essentially South Africans who came to the right set of
                    conclusions. Our pressure helped, but it was by no means determining.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the name Mandela a force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes. He was the imprisoned leader. His wife was out and a darling of the
                    embassies. Some diplomats were seeking to have affairs with her. One of them
                    succeeded. She's 20 years younger than Mandela, was on her own, and was
                    basically a woman of appetites and desires which she would indulge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was she an asset or a liability?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>CARNEY: She was a liability. The ANC came to recognize that, largely due to her
                    comment “with our necklaces and our matches we shall liberate this country.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The necklaces being tires.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Exactly, with petrol. And a last cigarette was offered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern at the time? When I was in African INR
                        back in the early '60s, we used to talk about there being a night of long
                        knives.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There was a considerable concern about that. It was given substance by
                    this practice of necklacing and stoning believed police informers and that sort
                    of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the police behave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: They shot everybody. And then the murder squads were out, too. There was
                    no doubt that? Ruthless is an Afrikaner characteristic as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were we received by the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was an era of good feeling but that gradually changed to where by 1986
                    the state president, P.W. Botha, was denying permission for any officials to go
                    on IV trips, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why had that changed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was perceived that we were in opposition to P.W.'s view of what South
                    Africa ought to look like, and we were. We always were. They decided we were no
                    longer willing to work with them, that we were insisting on change in a way that
                    they simply weren't willing to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that Crocker's view of constructive
                        engagement was beginning to have teeth in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Absolutely. I was all for it, behind it, and working with it.</p>
                <p>Q: Explain what you were doing to constructively engage.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Getting to know as much of Afrikaner polity and society as possible. I
                    was perhaps deficient in not going to the churches. But certainly on the
                    political side, both government and opposition, because there were Afrikaners in
                    the Progressive Federal Party, mainly from the Cape but they were Afrikaners.
                    Also getting to know just ordinary Afrikaners, which I would do through my
                    hobbies of shooting and hunting and book collecting, that sort of thing. Making
                    the point clear that South Africa couldn't stay where it was. The question was,
                    “How are you going to evolve?” Entering those debates and arguments. Listening
                    to South Africans, especially Afrikaners, saying, “You killed off your problem”
                    or “Your problem is so small you don't have it” and replying, “Do you want
                    prosperity here? You're going to have to give black South Africans who are
                    earning your prosperity a share of the profit.” It was at the same time not
                    wagging fingers and being in your face. (Ambassador) Herman Nickel was
                    particularly gifted at taking U.S. policy and turning it into speeches and
                    articles that would make the point in a way that was completely grasped, but
                    without offense by Afrikaners and English-speaking South Africans alike. He was
                    very good at that, as you would expect from a journalist of his background and
                    standing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the universities there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I had a rough go at Rhodes University in Grahamstown. The answer is, yes.
                    One of my efforts was with the head of Rand Afrikaans University in
                    Johannesburg, who was also head of the (Afrikaner) Broederbond at the time,
                    Professor Pete Delange.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Broederbond was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The Broederbond and the ANC were created in 1912 with very different
                    goals. The Broederbond aimed to build the place of the Afrikaner in his own
                    country, they feeling seriously and correctly put upon by the British. The
                    Broederbond underlay the victory of the National Party in 1948, defeating Jan
                    Smuts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you get in and talk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I did: Down at Rhodes University, very good conversation. Lots of
                    unhappiness from black students. The U.S. role with Savimbi. One student who was
                    very active in the United Democratic Front said, “You've got Savimbi. You've got
                    his head under your arm. You're carrying him forward like a football. How can
                    you expect to do anything in Angola?” My answer was, “Both sides have asked us
                    to help mediate. You can criticize the U.S., but the fact is, the MPLA has asked
                    us to be part of the effort to bring about a solution.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: All the South African universities except RAU and maybe PotgeitersrusI'm
                    not sure about Stellenboschad black students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was that working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Slowly, few, but beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to Namibia, what was your impression of this
                        contact group and how they worked together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: We worked very well. We and the Brits were particularly good at working
                    together. My opposite number, Graham Archer, had one of his staff doing Namibia.
                    He didn't do it himself. So we had the most senior level going in, except when
                    an ambassador would go over. And we all sort of saw roughly the same people and
                    pushed the South Africans, mainly then Foreign Minister Pik Botha and his staff,
                    to implement UN Security Council Resolution 435.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was this effective? It sounds like the South African
                        government could kind of say, “You're a bunch of outsiders giving me advice.
                        Thank you very much. There's the door.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, there was a UN Security Council resolution, which has the force of
                    law. The South Africans were in an impossible legal position because they failed
                    to give their League of Nations mandate over to the UN Trusteeship Council.
                    Practically speaking, the Russians had bellied up. Angola made a deal to kick
                    the Cubans out and began negotiations with Savimbi. There wasn't any reason to
                    keep Namibia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, it's got all the diamonds in the world, and uranium. The South
                    Africans signed the NPT, so that maybe became less urgent.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: “That's politics. We do business.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But politics intrude into business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, then we need to talk about Tiny Roland and that whole interesting
                    role that he had. I regret Frasure's death because he was much more aware of it
                    than I am.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Tiny Roland was a London based investment figure who had a finger in
                    every insurgency pie in Africa. He died of melanoma in the mid-'80s. He was
                    active in Sudan, South Africa, Angola, everywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role were the French playing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I can't remember. Friendly but not as active as we.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But essentially this was a group that worked
                        together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't split.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, it wasn't. It was one of the early formations of those kinds of
                    multinational groups that actually tries to get things done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Germans were there. Namibia was formerly German. And
                        the French and British.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: And the Dutch were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there concerns that the South Africans were trying to
                        split you up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>CARNEY: No, not to my knowledge. We were the most active. Chet (Crocker) or one
                    of his deputies, first Frank Wisner and then Chas Freeman, were in the area
                    every 3-4 months. Big effort on Chet's part to move things. He saw that
                    apartheid was stultified, that P.W. Botha couldn't go any further than their
                    constitutional referendum that he had passed in 1983. So, his focus shifted to
                    Angola.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that within the embassy you were all on the
                        same team? Or did you find that the junior officers were pushing to get out
                        and do more?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: More junior staff would argue that we were too close to the power
                    structure and that we needed to do more with black South Africa, but it was a
                    question of emphasis, not of fundamental policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the black African
                        leadership? Were you caught between the Inkatha and the ANC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, you just saw everyone. One of the last things I did just before
                    leaving the job in mid-'86 was the Pan African Congress successor called AZAPO
                    (Azanian Peoples Organization) had its national congress in Durban. It was open
                    to the embassies. I went down with Vicki, my wife, and we had the political
                    officer at the consulate in Durban at the congress. I can still remember, a
                    delegate from Namibia came over, Rukoro, and as he was walking up to be seated
                    in an honored place, he looked down and said, “What are you doing here?” You had
                    access. I think that was the bottom line, despite black criticism that the US
                    Administration was too close to the Afrikaner apartheid government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sometimes get the feeling that there was a split
                        in the administration between what Crocker was doing and maybe more
                        conservatives coming out of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I didn't. Honestly, I was a field mouse. I wasn't paying attention to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you left in '86, what was your feeling about
                        our sanctions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I never believed they were a particularly good idea. I always held to the
                    argument that it was better for the U.S. to stay engaged and invested because I
                    could see things starting to change in South Africa. It wasn't that we were
                    pushing against an open door because there was plenty of resistance to change.
                    But I'm not sure sanctions were the best way to foster that change.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was removing the American influence from the industrial
                        base. From our point of view, under their own internal pressures, they were
                        making much more room for black participation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, exactly. You lost that as people divested and sold out to local
                    companies and what have you. But in fact, the key aspect of the process was the
                    recognition by South Africans, notably Afrikaners, that if they wanted to
                    prosper they had to give blacks a share. That's what ultimately did it. The
                    sanctions might have helped but only in the sense that there was a risk that
                    they would become general. The Brits, for example, I talked with the provost of
                    Cambridge, who had the daunting challenge of doing the annual lecture? The most
                    noted precedent was from his predecessor many years removed, John Maynard
                    Keynes. Cambridge was going to divest from Barclays bank, so Barclays got out
                    (of South Africa). That sort of thing might have been more encouraging of the
                    process than just strict U.S. sanctions themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the equivalent in South Africa of a chattering
                        class, the intellectuals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, Nadine Gordimer, Andre Brink, J.M. Coetzee, Alan Patton, and a few
                    others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have much influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes and no. Their literature and their views were out everywhere and the
                    press was very active. The Rand Daily Mail, that bellied up and became The Star
                    and what have you? You also had a humorist, Peter Dirk Uys, who is still active,
                    who was brilliant, taking the mickey out of the entire Afrikaner establishment.
                    As his name betrays, he is, in fact, an Afrikaner. It was all out there waiting
                    to coalesce and it did. But it took somebody like Frederick Willem De Klerk to
                    do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he much of a figure when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes indeed. He was minister. But he was regarded as conservative. I never
                    met him. His then wife was regarded as even more conservative. They were
                    divorced and she was subsequently murdered in an apparent robbery and break-in.
                    One of the journalists whom I saw regularly? We were talking about De Klerk at
                    one point. He was the obvious successor of P.W. Botha as leader of the National
                    Party because he was the head of the Transvaal wing of the National Party. This
                    journalist had interviewed him and put the question to him, “Does not survival
                    of the Afrikaners mean Afrikaners must be dominant?” He did not get a good
                    answer, an answer promising of a future of an end to apartheid in that
                    discussion with De Klerk. That was '85.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in '86.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left, what were your thoughts of whither South
                        Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It's on its way to change. I figured by 2000 it would have changed, that
                    apartheid would have been ended. I did not predict it would be as early as
                    '94.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel it was going to happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Evolution. The Afrikaners making a deal. There wasn't any doubt in my
                    mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that there was a special? that within the
                        African South Africans, was there a mindset that they could probably do this
                        without being nasty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Right. I saw that, too. There still remained a reservoir of relative
                    goodwill among ordinary black South Africans. In the leadership by the time we
                    left had begun to see... first the same reporter who was at that initial dinner
                    with Cabelly, Pete Muller, had gone up to Lusaka to interview ANC leaders and
                    published his interview in the leading Afrikaans daily, Rapport. That sort of
                    process had gotten underway as well.</p>
                <p>The big problem was what do you do with the ANC that was so clearly dominated in
                    its executive by the South African Communist Party? That answer came when the
                    Soviet Union bellied up about 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a major concern of ours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I don't know. It was a major analytical concern of mine as I looked at
                    what could be done in the future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling that if things go on the way they
                        were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It would be a great obstacle, the SACP.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: For a sabbatical year, Una Chapman Cox, to do an independent
                    investigation of modern wildlife conservatioAmerica's role.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is November 1, 2002. Could you explain what the Cox
                        Foundation grant was and why you picked this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Let me note that Roy Atherton, who headed the Cox Foundation for so long,
                    died recently. It's a great loss. The foundation was launched by a grant from
                    Una Chapman Cox to give Foreign Service officers a chance to get some diversity
                    in their educational background for professional benefit. I applied at the
                    absolute last minute when I was leaving South Africa, had in South Africa
                    renewed my interest in wildlife, both the conservation side and the hunting
                    side, decided that this was obviously something that was of increasing
                    importance and value and even figuring even more and more in U.S. foreign
                    policy, said so in my application, and succeeded in getting a grant for a year
                    of independent study of what modern wildlife conservation is all about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about this and what did you pick up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I first wanted to find out what the structures and institutions and what
                    the theory and policy of wildlife conservation is, what the ethos and philosophy
                    was and is to this day. I started with a trip to Switzerland to talk to the
                    Worldwide Fund for Nature, which is what the World Wildlife Fund had just
                    become, transformed in a meeting that it had in Italy. The essential ethos was
                    established by the World Conservation Strategy in about 1990 and that was, and
                    is to this day, sustainable use, which is that wildlife resources are renewable
                    and that if they are used in a manner that can be sustained rather than
                    essentially destroying the resource, there is no reason why we can't use them
                    forever. Sustainable use could be everything from hunting and fishing to
                    ecotourism to game farming, any of a number of ways to do that that is not
                    destructive of the actual principle of the resource. It was very congenial. As a
                    hunter I certainly believe that. As a conservationist, I also believe it.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>There is an enormous argument between the preservationist, those who would
                    contend that wildlife should never be touched, that it is some sort of moral
                    failing, if not an actual crime or at the very least a sin to shoot or otherwise
                    harm wildlife. Those are the preservationists. The conservationists argue that
                    due to the growth of population and the resulting decrease in habitat, there is
                    an absolute requirement to manage wildlife, and that includes the sustainable
                    use of wildlife either through hunting or through culling of what are
                    scientifically deemed “excess” numbers of animals, excess to the carrying
                    capacity of the land. It's a big argument on elephants to be specific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you talk about wildlife conservation, this does not
                        include fish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: One of the things that I've done in the years since is watch closely the
                    progress on the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species
                    (CITES). Every 2 years, there is a conference of parties signatory to that. I
                    actually attended COP in Nairobi 2 years ago as an unpaid delegate attached to
                    the Safari Club International Observer Group. Stakeholders in wildlife are
                    afforded observer status at the conferences of parties. There is one about to
                    launch in Chile, the biannual meeting of the parties signatory.</p>
                <p>There is a separate set of treaties on marine mammals. The Endangered Species Act
                    in the United States also specifically deals with it as does a biodiversity
                    treaty. There is a philosophical argument that the CITES convention is outmoded,
                    and their Biodiversity Treaty ought to be the main vehicle for the conservation
                    and the sustainable use of the variety of species, including fish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is biodiversity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It's essentially a treaty which seeks to halt or at least limit to the
                    extent possible the extinction of species which continue at a fairly galloping
                    pace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '86, what was the status of wildlife preservation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There was an argument with no compromise between the preservationists who
                    contended it was immoral to use in whatever fashion species of wildlife for
                    human consumption, and the contrary view that not only did you want to use them
                    because there is a hunting instinct in the species, but it is the only way to
                    manage the species which would otherwise destroy their environment and wind up
                    extinct in the long run in any case.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The domesticated species do not figure. This is the trade and trafficking
                    of endangered species. The argumenand probably elephants are the best

                    could live to be 70 years old before its last set of teeth wear out and it can
                    no longer nourish itself. Lots of emotion. Lots of spillover there. But no
                    direct relationship with the domesticated species.</p>
                <p>Q: It would seem to be there would be a real problem in that a lot of these
                    arguments that we're putting up in Switzerland and in the halls of the United
                    States is all fine, but when you're talking about an awful lot of the wildlife
                    that's concentrated in quite poor areaAfrica, Southeast Asiwhere the people 1)
                    need meat and 2) a little money from people who want to hunt goes a long
                    way.</p>
                <p>CARNEY: You're touching the real essence of the problem. As many Africans see it,
                    do- gooders from the West are trying to tell them what to do with their
                    resources. The Humane Society is particularly at fault here. It has actually
                    threatened various governments demanding that they either end hunting or enact
                    very strict legislation, otherwise the Humane Society will work to end tourism.
                    That is a specific example from South Africa, where the culling of elephant in
                    Kruger Park sparked such Humane Society tactics. There are a couple of books to
                    read on the subject. Cleveland Amory's “Mankind” will give the green moral
                    repugnant point of view. Raymond Bonner's “At the Hand of Man?” Bonner is a “New
                    York Times” correspondent who was living in Nairobi. His wife, Jane Perlez, was
                    the “Times” bureau chief there. It gives the opposite view of unhappy
                    Africans.</p>
                <p>At the same time, you have this very day Richard Leaky, who is well known for his
                    many writings not only on paleoanthropology, but also on aspects of wildlife.
                    Mr. Leaky, recently head of the Kenya Wildlife effort, argues that you really
                    must not reopen the commercial trade in elephant ivory and elephant partskin and
                    meat and what have you. Kenya strongly opposes the southern African elephant
                    range states' opening their production to commercial trade. That is largely (in
                    my analysis) because Kenya and East Africa is corrupt and their governments are
                    incompetent, and there is not enough money in the warden system, and, moreover,
                    it has been the officials there who have been largely responsible for poaching
                    elephants and selling the ivory to the Hong Kong ivory carving market. In
                    southern Africa you are much more regulated. But, because there is no trade in
                    elephants? For example, in Zimbabwe you are seeing the elephant herd burgeoning
                    to the point that Mopani forests are turning into savannahs with consequent
                    effect on other species.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: I did. I produced a paper and was going to have it published by the
                    Foreign Service Institute but they took so long to get the publication in
                    procesalmost 9 months - that I essentially said? There were aspects of
                    congressional funding that needed to be done on a multiyear rather than a one
                    year basis. All of those had changed and would have required my updating the
                    paper, so I had it withdrawn from publication and I circulated it privately.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '87, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: In '87 to Jakarta as political counselor. I had known the ambassador,
                    Paul Wolfowitz, when he was Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and
                    Pacific Affairs. I had taken him around the Thai-Cambodian border when I was in
                    Bangkok in the political section. I called in about December of 1986. The
                    political counselor job was still vacant. Dennis Harter was the incumbent and
                    was scheduled to leave. I called up. Dick Howland was DCM. Very quickly I got
                    myself named political counselor in Jakarta. Vicki and I arrived about June.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there in Jakarta from '87 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: To '90.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk about Paul Wolfowitz. Today as we speak he is a figure of great
                    controversy over? He is number 2 in the Department of Defense and is considered
                    one of the major leaders in promulgating a war against Iraq. How did you find
                    him as a thinker, as a leader, and as a person?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: After we had been together for about 6 months, we were talking and I said
                    to him, “You are in an ideal situation in your present job.” He had started the
                    conversation by observing that the deputy chief of station, an old friend of
                    mine, someone who introduced Vicki and me to each other in Bangkok in the
                    earlier years, and I seemed to be among the few people in the government
                    overseas who got the most out of their foreign assignments. I responded that I
                    thought he was in an almost ideal situation. He had all the enthusiasms of a
                    first tour officer overseas. This was his first foreign posting. At the same
                    time, he got it as ambassador, so he was able to do the policy as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>He merits his reputation as someone not very interested in management. On
                    decision-making he would delay his decision-making to the very last possible
                    second with consequent impact on the bureaucracy that was trying to implement
                    the decision. It was sometimes very difficult to get people to scramble to move
                    forward on it. At the same time, he is enormously intellectually gifted and
                    honest, willing to ask all the tough questions, to turn the issues upside down
                    and have a look at them, to probe and demand a more thorough look and to demand
                    that drafters and political and economic officers look at their own assumptions
                    as they put together recommendations and even regular, ordinary cables.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political and economic situation and
                        relations with the U.S. in Indonesia when you arrived in '87?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I think I can encapsulize it by giving you a concrete example. The
                    Suharto government had been in power 21 years. Suharto effectively took power in
                    1966 after the would-be coup of 1965 known as Gestapu in Indonesian. The
                    children of Suharto had begun to become very active in business affairs with
                    corruption rampant, sweetheart deals the norm. After I had been there 3 to six
                    months, I got my colleagues in the political section to look very closely at
                    what was happening in Indonesia. We put together a cable which argued that the
                    Suharto government had exceeded the norms of Indonesian society when it came to
                    corruption and mismanagement, but not yet the tolerance. That cable went into
                    Washington causing a certain stir but it was well enough argued that it
                    convinced everyone. What's interesting is that it took about 10 years for it to
                    be crystal clear that they had exceeded the tolerance by then as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you're setting up a standard country? where do you

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I'll give you an illustration. For years, the late Mrs. Suharto, whose
                    given name was Tien, was known as Ibu or “Madame” Tien. Madame Ten Percent. In
                    Indonesia, the phrase was “Sepulu percent biasa lebi banyak coruptsi,” which
                    exactly means “Ten percent is normal. More than that's corruption.” By the time
                    we had gotten there, Mrs. Suharto had become known as Ibu Fifi, Madame
                    50/50.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We always have this problem that if corruption is endemic
                        and really bad at the same time we have a stable regime in a difficult
                        neighborhood, there is the problem about reporting on corruption. If you
                        over report on corruption, which is within the bloodstream of the system,
                        pretty soon it will start leaking to the press. Congress will say, “That's a
                        corrupt regime” and disregard it. So, you are not really moving? Diplomacy
                        is supposed to be living with a country for the most part. Did you feel
                        pressure on you on this corruption thing to say, “Okay, we've told them what
                        it is. Let's lay off?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Once we did that cable, there was much less internal embassy need to
                    report every single incidence of corruption. There was a big AID program there
                    so that had to be carefully watched. There was an enormous effort to get
                    American business in there. Power plants in West Java were of considerable
                    interest to a number of businesses in the U.S. On the other hand, corruption was
                    pretty well covered in the press. You could make sure that FBIS picked up and
                    translated such reports, which they did. I don't have a recollection that there
                    was great difficulty making sure that the extent of corruption was known to
                    Washington. Nobody had a cable slapped down. There was no effort from the
                    ambassador or the DCM to explicitly limit aspects of reporting, at least not
                    until John Monjo got there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Probably the most interesting aspect of what we did was the remarks that
                    Paul Wolfowitz made in the period just before his departure. He had earned such
                    a reputation as someone seriously interested in and concerned about Indonesians
                    themselves and about Indonesia in general, that he was able to make points which
                    included corruption in his public comment and even to the finance and bank
                    people and even to Suharto himself.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: One of the leading American businessmen there was and is to this day a
                    fellow named Jim Castle. Jim was recently quoted in the wake of the Bali
                    terrorism act of last month. Jim and I were at Cornell when I did that academic
                    year. That's where I met him. He was finishing his Ph.D. in Indonesian studies.
                    If you knew the system there, and often that would mean having an Indonesian
                    partner, you could do business. The problem then, as it is now, is that the
                    legal system was totally subject to bribery and corruption or localitis and you
                    could not rely on the legal system to prosecute a claim against an Indonesian
                    partner or a violation of a contract. You had to do it Indonesian style.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Q: I think this would mean that an American business that came in would come in
                    and really try to extract the maximum as quickly as possible on the theory that
                    they weren't sure how long they'd be there so rather than trying to develop
                    long-term foundations for this trade, just get in and get ready to get out.</p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes and no. The business which is the largest and longest running there
                    is FreeporMcMoRan. It's a spinoff from Freeport Sulphur. They signed the first
                    or second contract with the government that replaced Sukarno's in about 1966.
                    That was to run a copper mine in what used to be called New Guinea. They have
                    been there mining copper ever since. That's quite a long... We're talking
                    something that's very simple. You basically reduce mountains to ore and
                    concentrate the copper, pipe it down to a port and ship the product off to a
                    smelter in Japan. There are lots of impurities in that copper and those pay all
                    the costs of the mining. Impurities are gold and silver. The copper is pure
                    profit.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: The political situation was controlled by the government party, Golkar,
                    with a little bit of opposition politics there, but nothing to any great extent.
                    The Islamic movement was in 2 parts, a rather conservative movement based in
                    Surabaya run by the man who became the successor to Suharto and was then turfed
                    out to be replaced by Megawati Sukarno Putri, a fellow named Abdurrahman Wahid,
                    whom I can recall having at dinner at the house when I was political counselor,
                    and then a modern Islamic movement known as Muhammadiyah, which is currently run
                    by a fellow named Amin Rais, who was a contender to replace Abdurrahman Wahid
                    but couldn't mobilize the wherewithal to do so.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: In the 1930s Sukarno and his fellow members of the Indonesian
                    independence movement met in a major youth conference and decided that Indonesia
                    would be a secular state and that although the Javanese are by far in the
                    majority, the national language would be a trade language, which is essentially
                    what was spoken in Malaya, which is the Bahasa Indonesia of this day. To keep
                    Indonesia together - it is such a diverse state - the political philosophy has
                    been secular, diverse, and plural. Christians, Hindus as is the case of Bali,
                    and Muslims together in a single state. This was challenged with the separatist
                    movement in the far western part of the island of Sumatra, known as Acheh, that
                    began a separatist rebellion that the army was particularly ham-handed in trying
                    to put down.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, not at all. There was a period in which the East Timor situation once
                    again went on the boil. Indeed I made sure that the first trip I took as
                    political counselor outside of Jakarta was to Dili in East Timor to inform
                    myself on the Indonesian effort to suppress the East Timorese independence
                    movement, and to look at what Indonesia was doing to make unity with Indonesia
                    attractive. Had a good chat with the military commander there and argued
                    strongly to him, because he contended to me that there had been a number of
                    courts martial for abuses of human rights in Indonesia, that those needed to be
                    publicized, first of all to make the point among the troops, but second to
                    burnish Indonesia's reputation under considerable pressure for human rights
                    violations. It seemed to me that there wasn't much likelihood that the
                    Indonesians would do the right thing and convince East Timorese that they wanted
                    to be part of the greater archipelago.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: They moved in '75.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: The city wasn't shot up. They (The Jakarta authorities) were opening
                    immigration, to let a lot of traders in from Sulawesi and from some of the other
                    parts of the archipelago. And there was an increasing effort to build teak
                    forests. I remember looking at one in the eastern part of East Timor when we
                    flew out of Dili. Essentially there were lots of Indonesian doctors there. That
                    was one of the programs to try to build bridges and make unity with Indonesia
                    attractive. But the philosophy was, “You do what we want and we'll both be
                    happy.”</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>CARNEY: The far west of Sumatra. The last year we were in Indonesia, there was a
                    wonderful film done by an Indonesian director produced in Indonesia called “Tjuk
                    Nyak Dien.” Tjuk Nyak Dien was a woman who led one of the rebellions against the
                    Dutch at about the turn of the 20th century. The last trip I made was to Acheh
                    itself. I had an Indonesian friend who organized a contact who was delighted to
                    be my host because he was Indonesian police. Everybody thought he could keep a
                    watch on what I did. I went along, didn't take anyone, even a Bahasa speaker,
                    with me. I had studied Indonesian at home in the period of the posting but did
                    not speak Bahasa well enough to do serious political work. I had a 2 at the
                    best. I went through the Dutch cemetery in the capital there. The Dutch lost a
                    lot of men in their effort to subjugate the people of Acheh including several
                    generals, knights, and the cemetery is remarkable. It's kept up very nicely. It
                    seemed to me that you had ham-handed military effort, almost a parody of the
                    hearts and mind effort the U.S. ran in Vietnam, that was not going to be
                    successful. But I accepted the logic of Indonesians, that if you began letting
                    go of places that were part of Indonesia itself from the independence days, you
                    would risk enhancing the centrifugal forces to the point that Indonesia would
                    fly apart, which I did not see in anybody's interest, least of all the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to sound out what the Achenese leaders
                        wanted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I talked to a number of people there. They were very cautious talking to
                    me. To an extent it was clear there was a general desire to stay with Indonesia
                    if it was at all possible. But remember, Exxon, now Exxon Mobil, has its largest
                    money spinner in the form of gas fields just off the coast of Acheh. They were
                    not realizing a sufficient return on those resources.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about dealing with the Indonesian government? Did you

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Basically I dealt with the ministry of foreign affairs and the
                    parliament. A very good relationship with the foreign ministry, both the
                    Americas desk, international organizations desk, and the minister himself, Ali
                    Alatas. This became solidified when Indonesia took up the task as host of the
                    Jakarta Informal Meetings to try to bring about a resolution to the situation in
                    Cambodia. My expertise was well known since I was published on Cambodia and knew
                    all the players.</p>

                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Very much. It was the Jakarta Informal Meetings. I was the central
                    watcher for that process and did the reporting. We were not formal observers
                    there, so I would have to run around and chase Cambodian and Indonesian
                    participants to find out what had gone on at the meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of these meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: That they weren't going to produce results because it was a little too
                    early, but it was good to get ASEAN engaged in trying to push the Cambodian
                    process forward. The French were particularly egregious. They were very unhappy
                    with the Australians. The French continued to believe that Indochina was their
                    bailiwick. The Australians, as an Asia and Pacific power believed, as it turned
                    out correctly, that they had important things to say and do to help bring about
                    resolution of the issue. Probably the best anecdote on this was at the very last
                    of the JIM meetings, the Australian foreign minister, volatile Gareth Evans, who
                    now heads the International Crisis Group operating out of Brussels, a group that
                    Mort Abramowitz founded just after he was at Carnegie... The French had been
                    going around throwing banana peels under an effort the Australians launched for
                    a peace plan for Cambodia. This became well known to the Australians that the
                    French were pooh-poohing and dismissing the Australian contribution. At a press
                    conference, Evans started out saying, “Ladies and gentlemen, I want to make it
                    clear that contrary to what has been published in the press, I have never called
                    my French colleagues 'perfidious frogs.' I have called them, in fact,
                    “perfidious fucking frogs.” That sort of set the tone of Australian-French
                    relations which continued to the UNTAC period in Cambodia itself.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: We did not. We had a watching brief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did we hope would come out of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: We didn't know. We were willing to let it go forward and see what might
                    happen. I really didn't have a clue what Washington was thinking about. They
                    were avidly devouring the reporting we did, which was copious. But essentially
                    at about this time there was a Cambodia conference in Paris that went nowhere.
                    But the issue seemed still to be in a military phase with the Chinese supplying
                    guns and ammunition to the Khmer Rouge through Thailand, the Malaysians and
                    Singaporeans supplying guns and ammunition to the non-communist Cambodians
                    through Thailand, and the U.S. supplying non-lethal equipment through AID money
                    (it might have been ESF) also through Thailand, with the CIA actively keeping
                    tabs on the situation also through Thailand.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Exactly. That situation finally broke loose in 1990 or '91 when the 5
                    permanent members of the Security Council together with the UN Secretariat began
                    a series of meetings with the Cambodian parties that ultimately resulted in the
                    Paris Agreements of 1991.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the politics of Indonesia? You've got this huge
                        state - lots of people, lots of islands, lots of distances. Did their
                        parliament represent the various groups or was it dominated from a center
                        and orders just went out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Essentially the government party, GOLKAR, was the main player in
                    parliament. There were also a number of appointed members of parliament which
                    meant that there might have been debate in parliament but parliament was a
                    rubber stamp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the head of the political section, who were the people
                        that you really wanted to find out who was doing what to whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I would talk to the various people in Golkar, Golkar being a movement
                    rather than a political party. You would get various traits and tendencies in
                    Golkar and talk to some of the Golkar leaders. We worked with people who were
                    not in parliament but were politically active such as Abdurrahman Wahid and the
                    Islamic groups. The DATT worked with the military because the military then as
                    now continued to see themselves much as the Turkish military do, but without the
                    constitutional mandate to ensure stability in the Indonesian state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have problems with the Indonesians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: We did not. You knew 'tho that it was going to come apart because Suharto
                    was not bringing up a successor. The fellow who eventually and briefly succeeded
                    him, an islander named Habibi, was basically an engineer who was the head of the
                    state aircraft industry. Indonesians produce parts for F-16s and were building
                    their own version of a medium sized civilian aircraft, a turbo jet. There was
                    state of the art equipment to produce aircraft parts, better than Thailand, in
                    fact. But there did not seem to be a serious effort to look at a transition in
                    politics much less an opening up that would begin to let Indonesians feel as if
                    they were part of the government of the country.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: They were. The other big difference between the 2 nations is that
                    everybody in politics in Indonesia remembered what happened after November of
                    1965. The figures ranged from half a million, to well over that, dead in the
                    chaos that followed on the assassination of the generals and the cleanup under
                    Suharto. Nobody wanted to see that happen again because Indonesia's so big and
                    centrifugal. The fear was that kind of chaos would destroy Indonesia.</p>

                        this at all a myth or something going around in Indonesia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I had been at Cornell from 1975 to '76, so I was steeped in the Cornell
                    mythology of Indonesia. Ben Anderson, a prominent protagonist in that, was my
                    faculty advisor. The late George McT. Kahin and his wife Audrey were on
                    sabbatical at that time. I never really bought that. Barbara Harvey, who did a
                    Cornell monograph on Permesta - “Half a Rebellion” I think she called it - was
                    in Surabaya as consul general then. She came out of that Cornell tradition as
                    well. Of course, Cornelians were always in Indonesia. Jim Castle, whom I
                    mentioned as a businessman, was there. And any number of people were there doing
                    field work for their Ph.D. dissertations- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>Indonesian officials always viewed Cornell graduates with a jaundiced eye because
                    of the legacy of that widely published Cornell Paper (on the coup). But there
                    was no impact on relations with the range of Indonesians I dealt with, who
                    included academics, think tank people, Indonesian military. I didn't have that
                    much to do with Americans.</p>

                <p>Q: Were we doing anything with the Indonesian military to get them to be a little
                    less ham- handed?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: I know the DATT [defense attach�], Colonel Jay Mussels, was very active
                    with the Indonesian military. He and I worked very closely together. At one
                    point we used the DATT aircraft to fly an ostensible political counselor's trip
                    to Ambon, Biak, Jayapura, Merauke, the capital of West Timor, Kupang, and then
                    Sumbawa and Bali, where I got off and met Vicki. Terrific trip. We met any
                    number of military and civilian officials throughout the eastern part of the
                    archipelago that way. Lots of effort on behalf of the DATT working closely with
                    the Ambassador - both Paul Wolfowitz and John Monjo to push a little bit with
                    relatively little success.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were things going in Borneo and Irian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Borneo was one place I did not get to. There didn't seem to be too many
                    issues there except those created by the effort on the part of the government to
                    send migrants from the overpopulated parts of Java to Borneo. In Irian or the
                    Indonesian part of New Guinea, I visited some migrant villages where life was
                    pretty basic. It was clear that the effort couldn't possibly succeed. It just
                    cost too much to ship people out of Java and then provide them with the
                    wherewithal to begin a new life. It wasn't like the U.S. where people
                    essentially used their own resources to fund their movement west.</p>
                <p>New Guinea is an amazing place. I have talked about the copper mine that Freeport
                    had. I visited the capital of the province, which used to be Hollandia and is
                    now Jayapura, Victorious City or City of Victory in Sanskrit. The middle part of
                    the island, the Baliem Valley, where as cold as it is, people are essentially
                    naked. And Merauke itself where you have the emus wandering around and emu eggs
                    are sold. Biak Island to this day has the caves infamous from World War II. The
                    Japanese garrison refused to surrender and allied troops rolled gasoline drums
                    into the caves and ignited them with tracer gunfire. Bones are still being
                    brought out of those caves. A Japanese association dealing with missing in
                    action and war veterans comes annually to conduct appropriate rites for the
                    remains. It's a remarkable place.</p>

                    educated citizenry and breadth in potential governing class that they could
                    manage the transition. I did not think it would fall apart.</p>

                    “Berkeley mafia” and then its successors, Chicago, Cornell, and Princeton. No
                    question. A major role on the part of the U.S. This was why one became so
                    unhappy with the effort to isolate the Indonesian military through an end of the
                    IMET program and military sales which happened after I left.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: As I think I've explained, a belief that they were on the edge of

                <p>CARNEY: No, we weren't at that time. Suharto was such a clever politician. He had
                    essentially marginalized those who might think of a coup. Notably at that time
                    it would have been (General) Benny Murdani, who once he lost his command in

                <p>CARNEY: That was a fascinating period. Indonesians were deeply interested. You
                    had American thinkers being brought out to talk at Indonesian think tanks like
                    the one run by Yusef Wanandi, aka Lim Bian Kie, and his associates. Very much
                    attention being paid by Indonesians themselves. That was what opened the
                    possibility for a solution in Cambodia. The Soviets were the ones funding the
                    Vietnamese who were in turn active in Cambodia. This was a particular aspect
                    that Indonesians, Thais, Singaporeans, and Malaysians focused on. It also helped
                    bring the Soviets - about to become Russians - into the fold for UNSC effort to

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The Japanese had an enormous aid program to Indonesia. We instituted a
                    policy of cooperation with the Japanese in the hope of helping to influence how
                    they used their aid in Indonesia. They had a very capable set of political
                    officers and a fellow who is also a Cambodian specialist was posted in

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes. The Indonesian navy was fairly active but mainly in a coastal role
                    and we were always worried that they were going to try to close one of the
                    straits, which under international law they had and have no right to do. Even
                    though we hadn't signed the Law of the Sea, we stated we would act according to
                    its provisions. I think we eventually accepted the Indonesian “archipelagic
                    concept” with the straits not part of it.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: Singapore was intensely interested in stability in Indonesia and always
                    worried about it. The Malaysians and the Indonesians have a territorial dispute
                    over parts of Borneo and problems with Islam as well because Malaysia is an
                    Islamic state and Indonesia is not. And you had (private) Malaysians supporting
                    the separatists in Acheh. A very complicated relationship.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: It's very spotty, always has been. You have an occasional ambassador of
                    amazing breadth and competence, but most were too Javanese to get along in the
                    States, not willing to push themselves forward, thinking they didn't have to
                    meet with staffers because they were an ambassador and ought to be meeting with
                    congressmen or senators.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: The businessmen were very interested. The ambassador was often called
                    upon to use his weight on behalf of businessmen and it worked pretty well. When
                    the ambassador decided to get engaged, he could move things.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: He worked very well for the business community. The Indonesians thought
                    he was an odd duck. He wasn't really interested in Indonesia. He might have been
                    in earlier postings there, but he ceased to be interested in Indonesia. He spoke
                    good Bahasa, but as designer Iwan Tirta put it one time, “He speaks Bahasa to
                    Americans and serves bad food to his guests at home.” That reputation colored
                    the Indonesian view of this tour.</p>

                    receptions. Vicki and I had dinners regularly including receptions for CODELs.
                    We'd have a whole lamb, for example. Or depending on who was invited, we once or
                    twice had Babi Menado, which is roast pig, north Sulawesi style. I hunted in
                    west Java once or twice, brought back a wild pig, and served it at dinner. There
                    was a whole crowd there, pick up food. The pig was off in one corner, not
                    identified. There wasn't any left.</p>

                <p>I had an Indonesian friend who was involved in refugee affairs because there was
                    a boat people camp, one of the other neuralgic issues. His name was Lieutenant
                    Colonel Mohamed. I asked him about that. He would hunt these wild... They're
                    basically feral pigs, pretty big, 300 pounds. He said, “You know, babi is the
                    Indonesian word for pig and nobody eats pig. But these wild pigs are known in
                    Javanese as chaleng. Like every good hunter, I always eat what I hunt. Chaleng
                    is not a babi.”</p>

                    some Cambodians bribe their way to Jakarta itself. We had a refugee officer in
                    Singapore, Carol Courtney, who came over and talked to some of these people.
                    They were generally treated well enough. I suspect by now those camps are long
                    emptied and everybody's gone.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: Interviewing to see if they fit our category for early movement to the

                        You've got this vast continent with hardly any people in it and just above
                        it you've got this vast area with too damn many people in it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, I got along very well with the Australians. They had some very good
                    people there. The DCM, David Irvine, did a book on the Indonesian shadow
                    theater. Knowledgeable. You're correct. Indonesia is the classic threat in all
                    the Australian contingency planning, which the Indonesians found very amusing,
                    arguing that there wouldn't be any way for the military to get through the
                    traffic to get across the island to the south coast to have an invasion. I used
                    to tease the Australians that the biggest danger to their continent was if the
                    Indonesian population would line up on the south coast and everybody would take
                    a leak, the resulting tidal wave would inundate Australia. They had the grace to
                    laugh.</p>

                <p>There are 100,000 or so Australian tourists a year in Bali. The problem was, and
                    I think I've referred in earlier discussions to the views of one of my guys when
                    I was consul in Udorn, that it's an easy, convenient, and sometimes illuminating
                    way to look at peoples as if they have a switch in the brain, a binary switch.
                    The Thais can be viewed as looking at things as either sranuk, fun and engaging,
                    or not sranuk, which is very bad. The American switch is, is it true or is it
                    false? The British switch is, is it of proper class or is it not? The
                    Indonesian, especially Javanese, switch is, is it refined, halus, or is it
                    coarse and crude, kasar? Australians are the living definition of coarse. There
                    is a built-in problem between the Indonesian political elite, essentially
                    Javanese, and Australia, and that will persist forever. Australians are not
                    going to change.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: I left in about July of 1990. I did not have an onward assignment. I went
                    to New York to be the EAP Bureau advisor to the U.S. General Assembly delegation

                <p>CARNEY: I was sent as a Cambodia specialist, but by then the permanent 5 had
                    taken the issue so completely under their belts that Cambodia wasn't an issue at
                    the General Assembly that year as it had been since the Khmer Rouge were booted
                    out of power. So I wound up doing driftnet fishing. Fascinating.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: A driftnet is a miles-long net that sits just under the surface.
                    Unfortunately, it catches everything, including birds. These things are regarded
                    as anti-conservation. There was an effort to ban driftnet fishing. I think there
                    already was a ban but this was to tighten it and it succeeded as part of the
                    appropriate UN...</p>

                    think the Italians were using driftnets in the Med. Lots of room for correction
                    here. Maybe the Spaniards. But that effort succeeded. The General Assembly runs
                    from September to just before Christmas. That's the only thing that stands out

                <p>CARNEY: Back to the EAP bureau overcomplement to do the first EAP bureau program
                    plan. That is when the State Department finally decided to get serious about
                    budgeting. It's since been turned into both bureau and mission. It's not called
                    a “program plan” anyway. A “performance plan” maybe.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: That had died. This was a serious effort that continues to this day on
                    the part of the Department to get a handle on what the U.S. wants to do in a
                    given bureau, what resources are available to do it, how to measure it. Sylvia

                    anybody was willing to offer me. Doug offered me one of the directorships for
                    Asia on the NSC staff, so I took that. I did that March/April of '91 until about
                    February of '92.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been the end of the Bush
                        administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The elections were in '92. It was the third year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of issues were you dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Cambodia and the U.S. effort to work with the Perm 5 to bring about a
                    negotiated solution there. Of course, there was the Philippines and that was
                    fascinating. Then there was China and the most favored nation issue, which Doug
                    Paal did. But the Philippines and the Pacific Islands were in my bailiwick. The
                    question on the Philippines was, they were essentially... We had closed Clark
                    (Air Force base), but we really wanted to stay at Subic Bay (Naval Base). The
                    Philippines wanted to charge us way more money than we were willing to pay. The
                    State Department, (Assistant Secretary) Dick Solomon, (DAS) Ken Quinn, were
                    arguing to (Secretary) James Baker that we ought to pay it. I didn't know where
                    to come down on that. I wasn't a Philippine specialist, but it seemed to me that
                    we were being held up. I knew we wanted to be able to project our power, but I
                    wasn't sure whether we needed to have a base in the Philippines to be able to do
                    that, especially with the Soviet Union being in the process of bellying up. We
                    went over to the Joint Chiefs to the appropriate office to talk about the
                    Philippines on day, and I listened to them talk about how militarily needed it
                    was. I got back to the office and called Jim Wilkinson. Jim had been political
                    counselor in Bangkok when I was political officer there in the '80s, and he had
                    been number 3 or 4 at USUN when I had spent that 3 month period there the
                    previous year. He had gone as Polad at CINCPAC. He was in the process of
                    divorcing and ultimately remarrying. I called him and I said, “I don't
                    understand what's going on with the Philippines.” He said, “Let me talk about
                    it.” He called me back and said, “The CINC goes not believe that we need to have
                    a base in the Philippines. We do not need to be forward based. We can have a
                    logistics nose there but we don't need to have Subic Bay as a base.” I did a
                    memo through Doug Paal to Brent Scowcroft saying that. Doug had a note on it
                    back from Scowcroft that said, “Mighty strange memo.” But that was it. Once the
                    CINC decided that we did not need to have the facility at Subic Bay, that ended
                    it. My argument was by no means original with me. In any case, we needed a new,
                    more mature relationship with the Philippines. The way to get it was to leave
                    our bases in the Philippines and bring the Filipinos into a more serious and
                    mature partnership with us. That seems to be to be what's happened since
                    then.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling? Was it that the Filipino political
                        system, did they want to get rid of the United States or did they figure
                        they had a prime patsy as far as money was concerned and “Let's just sock it
                        to 'em?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I don't know. I have never been to the Philippines. I guess all of those
                    elements are there. The relationship with the U.S. is enormously complex and
                    emotional and laden with our colonial period there, our effort to educate, and
                    our response during and after World War II. But it was clear that that
                    relationship was in a sclerosis back when I was on the NSC staff and we needed
                    to do something. Once the military decided we could get along without bases
                    there, State couldn't say that was very interesting. Solomon couldn't see it.
                    Ken Quinn couldn't see it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting because normally the State reaction would
                        be “bases are a pain in the neck. Everything begins to revolve around them.”
                        I can think of the Azores with Portugal way back and the Asmara camp that
                        completely skewed our relationship with the Ethiopians. Somalia. And Greece.
                        Normally we just want to get rid of them and have State be the
                        proponent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: When was Solomon ambassador in the Philippines? I think it might have
                    been after that. It would be interesting to listen to Dick now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a temporary job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes. I was in a holding pen. When the Paris Agreements for Cambodia were
                    signed in October of '91, it was clear that a senior U.S. official was going to
                    be part of the mission. Yasushi Akashi was ultimately named SRSG, and I went up
                    to New York and talked to him in December or January of '92. He wasn't sure what
                    he wanted me to do. It might have been human rights or something else. He talked
                    about the elections. I remember saying to him, “There is a key aspect of those
                    elections. Given what's happened in Cambodia, people have to know their vote's
                    secret.” These were going to be the only elections the UN had ever actually
                    conducted. I said, “But more than that, they have to be assured that their
                    village's vote is secret lest the victors ultimately wreak wrath through denial
                    of development monies just to make an example of the village that did not vote
                    for them.” Akashi was so taken with that that he decided I ought to be director
                    of information and education, which is what I went to Cambodia with the UN to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Cambodia from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: March 25 of '92 to August 1, '93.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a bit about Akashi.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Akashi, very Japanese, career UN, played things pretty close to his vest
                    much to the annoyance of the other UN people who were part of the UN mission to
                    Cambodia known as the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia. He was extremely
                    good with Sihanouk, not bad as a diplomat. He was okay for that job but he
                    needed a lot of stiffening and the stiffening came to a degree from his deputy,
                    Behrooz Sadri, also a career UN officer, but more so from the Force Commander,
                    an Australian, John Sanderson, who wound up head of the Australian forces and,
                    now in retirement, is Governor of West Australia at Perth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you operate with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Very much hands on; one on one direct contact. He had a daily staff
                    meeting for the senior staff. He would have, every 6 weeks or so, a meeting with
                    my division, Information and Education, looking at things we were setting
                    forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: We were doing about 4 things and we were doing it in print, which
                    included posters, comic books, leaflets, pamphlets, and posters and banners. We
                    were doing it in radio, radio broadcasts to provide information on what the UN
                    was doing in Cambodia in the first place and then on what you as a Cambodian had
                    to do to register to vote, where to vote. Then we were evening the information
                    playing field by giving the various political parties a platform to voice their
                    views. Then we were doing all those things through TV as well. We had a TV
                    studio which ultimately proved able to produce an hour of TV a day. Our radio
                    effort came to produce 15 hours of programming a day, live from March 1993 to
                    the end of the UN Mission.</p>
                <p>Finally, the Paris Accords gave to the UN Transitional Authority control over
                    specific fields of governance - military, administration, and information,
                    press. There was a Civil Administration component set up as part of the UNTAC
                    structure and the head of that, a French judge, gave to various other components
                    the right of control over their specific area. So, my division had control over
                    the field of information, which essentially meant enforcing what we drafted in
                    conjunction with the 4 Cambodian parties ( except the Khmer Rouge who boycotted
                    the drafting effort), the Media Guidelines, whereby if there was a violation of
                    fair comment or libelous statements, we would order a right of reply by the
                    offending media.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>That was a fascinating year and a half partly because of the control dimension,
                    but even more so because of the very great complexity, including trying to stand
                    up a radio broadcast facility from “not even a paper clip” as one of my staff
                    members described it. We did it... First of all, you had the programming aspect.
                    We programmed basically through soap operas - aunt, uncle, nephew and niece -
                    all this in Cambodiabeginning with nephew wondering who those people in the blue
                    berets are. Then it went on to more complicated soap operas that had a man with
                    a gun come into their house on stilts and say, “It doesn't matter what Radio
                    UNTAC says, you all are going to vote for my party.” Then when he left the aunt
                    would say, “Why did you tell him we'd do that?” The uncle would say, “You can
                    tell him anything, but your vote is secret. You vote the way you want. You can
                    even take bribes from him and you can vote the way you want. They're the ones
                    who are wrong and they're intimidating us. We can lie to them. It's okay.”
                    That's a specific example of one of our soap operas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying on the vote that the ballot is secret.
                        That I can take. But when you say that you can't tell how the village voted,
                        that gets very tricky.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It turned out to be easy to do. They moved the ballot boxes from each
                    constituency voting place to the province capital and mixed them all together
                    and counted them there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're so used to having a local vote.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: You're right, there is a philosophical argument that you really do want
                    the local vote, but in the circumstances, the electoral component, run by a
                    white Zimbabwean as it turned out, much to the UN's chagrin, they were looking
                    for diversity, essentially accepted my argument that secrecy outweighed other
                    considerations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the contending parties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There was a raft of 24 or more parties, but the essential contending
                    party was the incumbent, the Vietnamese installed authority, the Cambodian
                    People's Party. There were 2 non-communist parties, but the main one was a party
                    that was run by Prince Sihanouk's son, Norodom Ranarith, and a separate
                    non-communist party run by a former Cambodian republican, the latSonn Sann that
                    was not sufficiently active and got very few seats as a result.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Khmer Rouge...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>CARNEY: The Khmer Rouge ultimately refused to participate in the process, did not
                    canton their troops as required by the Paris Accords, did not play the radio
                    broadcast tapes that we gave all the factions to play until we got our own radio
                    broadcast facility 4 months before the elections. Essentially, as I argued just
                    after the elections in a seminar in Singapore that has since been published, the
                    Khmer Rouge decision doomed them as a force in Cambodian political life, which
                    is no loss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, it's no loss at all. Often the group will feel they
                        can avoid something and if they guess wrong, time moves on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: They tried to have it both ways for a long time with 2 of their senior
                    figures who were resident in Phnom Penh for a long time, months, looking at
                    creating another United Front style political party. Ultimately Pol Pot decided
                    that they wouldn't take part, they would try to sabotage the elections and see
                    if the Khmer Rouge could reemerge as a coalition player in a future Cambodia.
                    That just simply didn't work because they lost their foreign support completely,
                    and the other Cambodian parties were able to come together to form a
                    sufficiently strong military to resist them and even ultimately if necessary to
                    crush them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Chinese play a role in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The Chinese, I dealt with them pretty regularly. They played a
                    forthcoming role in this. They had several people on the UNTAC staff, including
                    a couple of Cambodian speakers. My division, however, had almost all of the
                    foreign speakers of Cambodian. If I had thought about a Chinese, I would have
                    asked Beijing to give me one. But I just didn't think about it. I had 15
                    foreigners who spoke Cambodian, 15 of the 45 expatriates in the Information and
                    Education directorate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were doing this, did the State Department have
                        any say or do anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: In order to join Akashi's staff, I formally resigned from the Foreign
                    Service with right of reemployment, and joined the UN Secretariat. Article 100
                    of the charter specifies that members of the Secretariat will only take orders
                    from UN officials. I think that's why the Department insists that people
                    formally resign even if they have rights of reemployment. In the 18 months I was
                    with the UN, I was not a Foreign Service officer, which had the collateral
                    benefit of enabling me to sue Radio France International when their local
                    correspondent broadcast an entirely too clever piece accusing me of being a CIA
                    agent in deep cover in the UNTAC apparatus with the goal of denying to the true
                    victors, the Cambodian People's Party, the fruits of their electoral win. I took
                    them to court in France. I ultimately won one franc in damages and $8,000 in
                    legal fees, which didn't cover what it cost.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the French playing a role in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, indeed. They tried to torpedo the Australian effort to have General
                    Sanderson as force commander by giving an extra star to their Brigadier. The
                    Australians then gave an extra star to their man, who wound up a 3 star. The
                    Frenchman was a 2 star. Loridon was the Frenchman's name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the French game?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, it was L'Indochine Francaise. “We're the ones who have the
                    experience and the background here.” But, they didn't have any Cambodian
                    speakers. I can't imagine what they were thinking. I tried to get a French woman
                    who was particularly gifted at Cambodian studies, but she was working for this
                    Centre Nationale de Recherche Scientifique and wasn't interested, so I got an
                    East German, an Australian, a Brit, a Canadian, and a bunch of Americans.</p>

                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was a great problem, and (UN Secretary General) Boutros Ghali did not
                    shine. He initially on his first visit to Cambodia argued that we really didn't
                    need a radio broadcast facility. I had on my way to Cambodia stopped in Bangkok
                    and the Thai foreign ministry press head, Sakthip Krairaiksh, who is currently
                    ambassador in Washington. Sakthip and his wife, Benjapa, were at Vicki and my
                    wedding- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>I stopped in Bangkok and talked to Sakthip Krairaiksh about using the joint VOA
                    Thai AM transmitter at the airport to broadcast UNTAC material because it was
                    maybe a million watt AM transmitter and it could be heard in Cambodia past
                    thMekong. Sakthip said, “Yes,” but USIA had to agree. I sent a message off
                    through the embassy in Phnom Penh - we had a charg� d'affaires at that time,
                    Charles Twining - and the word we got back was, “Of course, you can have 4:00 AM
                    as your timeslot.” That was so inadequate that I mobilized Akashi to get hold of
                    rather more senior people than the head of USIA. We got a couple of slots at
                    prime time. So, we sent our tapes to Bangkok for VOA to play on AM, as well as
                    the various FM stations of the Cambodian parties. Thais were very active, very
                    forthcoming on this. I used my contacts with a Thai of some dubious background,
                    a businessman who was close to the Thai military intelligence side, to get me a
                    trip to the Thai border to go in and see the Khmer Rouge. We got there but they
                    wouldn't receive me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I personally dealt with Hun Sen and irritated the hell out of him on any
                    number of occasions. The radio broadcast facility got under his skin because we
                    were basically telling it like it was, and it didn't make him happy particularly
                    when we began to broadcast the electoral results that went against the Cambodian
                    People's Party. Ranarith's party won about 46% and Hun Sen's party 38%, so they
                    essentially lost the election.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Basically they argued for realpolitique that Hun Sen was the strongest
                    and his people were the most capable and besides that, they weren't going to
                    give up governing the country anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the end of this, when the election came, was there any
                        apparatus to make sure that the election took hold?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: That was a weakness of the Paris agreements. The only entity that
                    persisted after a constitution was drafted - and the end of the UNTAC period was
                    defined as the ratifying of the constitution - was a UN human rights center.
                    There wasn't a real follow-on. That's a flaw of the drafting of the Paris
                    Agreements that you can argue by hindsight, and indeed it has been argued in any
                    number of publications. What happened after the elections was, the People's
                    Party was very reluctant to accept the results. There was a little bit of
                    theater when one of Sihanouk's sons, who was close to Hun Sen and other leading
                    figures in the People's Party, staged a secession of a number of the eastern
                    provinces of Cambodia. Akashi was stiffened in his resolve by Sanderson and a
                    number of other UN senior figures and that secession failed, but the compromise
                    that resulted was a co-prime ministership of Hun Sen and Norodom Ranarith. That
                    government persisted until 1997 when Hun Sen essentially ran a coup and took
                    over all by himself.</p>

                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>CARNEY: I wondered that myself. A number of people got out, including some of my
                    ex- wife's relatives. My first wife was ethnically Cambodian. When I went to
                    Phnom Penh the first time with Senators Danforth, Baucus, and Sasser in 1979, I
                    found myself looking at all the small crowds around us when we were on the
                    street in Phnom Penh and realized I was looking for somebody I knew. I ran into
                    some people that I knew on the Thai-Cambodian border, and helped them, including
                    some of my ex-wife's relatives, and brought them to the refugee center at Khao I
                    Dang. But when I was back with UNTAC, almost the first thing I did was, I asked
                    where one could play tennis. I went over and there were a number of the
                    entraineurs, the trainers, whom I had learned and played with at the Cercle
                    Sportif in the period I was there, all of them a bit older. A couple of them had
                    died, but most were still there. Of the political figures, there were very few.
                    Most of those people had either gotten out or been caught and killed by the
                    Khmer Rouge, so I didn't see anyone there. But of course, I had known a lot of
                    the new figures from the period of negotiations that I had sat in on as NSC
                    staff member, as well as people whom I had met with the 2 CODELs that visited in
                    '79 and the one in 1981.</p>

                    in the way of essentially replacing April Glaspie, to the unhappy Admiral
                    Jonathan T. Howe, who was Special Representative of the Secretary General.</p>

                <p>Today is February 27, 2003. We're to 1993. What happened?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: My wife, Vicki, and I left Phnom Penh on August 1. This was some
                    considerable time - 6-8 weeks - before the UN mission actually ended. But my
                    argument was that the work of Radio UNTAC and the UN media effort was
                    essentially done. It was now up to the new government, both the winners and the
                    losers in the election, working through a Constituent Assembly to put together a
                    Cambodian constitution that was the effective end of the UNTAC mandate. But my
                    own seemed to have come. The large bulk of UN presence in Cambodia was beginning
                    to be self-defeating. The reality was that just too many foreigners were in too
                    prominent a set of positions. I was happy to leave.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>I went to Namibia to do some big game hunting. Had talked a bit about an onward
                    assignment. I cannot recall if I even saw a bid list, but it was clear that
                    there wasn't anything being offered and I'm not sure if anything was of huge
                    interest. I got back to Washington partly to discover, falsely as it turned out,
                    that I had been TIC'ed out. Having joined the UN, I got an efficiency report
                    from a Special Representative of the Secretary General. There was also some bad
                    information given to the board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain what TIC means.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: TIC is the “time in class” rule. I had been regarded as having been too
                    long in class at the first level oSenior Foreign Service rank. Those are the two
                    things I can remember. Then, Peter Tarnoff, Undersecretary of State for
                    Political Affairs, asked me to come have a chat. I did. He suggested that it
                    would be enormously useful if I would go to Mogadiscio. The American who was the
                    Special Representative of the Secretary General had been Brent Scowcroft's
                    deputy on the previous National Security Council staff, Admiral Jonathan T.
                    Howe. He was in serious need of political advice. The UN apparently didn't
                    agree. The aptly named James Jonah was the relevant Under Secretary General, and
                    he didn't want another American in the mission in Mogadiscio. That had to be
                    fought all the way up to (Secretary General) Boutros Ghali before I was finally
                    processed by the UN bureaucracy. I arrived in Mogadiscio in early December of
                    1993.</p>
                <p>I stopped in London on the way because all of this to-ing and fro-ing with the UN
                    had given me about 6 weeks to actually learn something about Somalia, as
                    incredible as that might sound. I read a number of books and discovered that the
                    grand old man of Somali studies was Ioan Lewis, not to be confused with the
                    Islamic scholar whose name is Bernard Lewis. I called either SOAS or LSE and
                    they were delighted to give me his home phone number. No such thing as privacy
                    in the UK, thank you, except if you try to put salacious photographs of somebody
                    in the newspapers, no matter how prominent they might be, as Fergie found out
                    one time.</p>
                <p>I called him up, said I could stop through London. He was delighted, gave me the
                    name of the tube stop and walking directions to his house. Indeed, I did stop
                    through London. I went over and had a terrific interview with someone who
                    actually knows Somalia and was appalled at the direction the UN mission had
                    taken, the transformation of it from a humanitarian mission, UNOSOM I, United
                    Nations Operation in Somalia, to UNOSOM II, the latter being what we're doing in
                    Afghanistan now, and what we hope to do in Iraq, which is to say, nation
                    building.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>In fact, he bustled away, made some French press coffee, which if I can't get
                    espresso is my next favorite, brought some Scottish shortbread out, and the two
                    of us sat down. He looked me in the eye and said, “You know, Somalia is a
                    contest between American high tech and Somalia low cunning.” He left no doubt
                    about who was winning. He was right. When I got there, it was a zoo. The
                    headquarters of the mission was the former U.S. embassy compound that Jim Bishop
                    had so belatedly evacuated during the Gulf War. Everything had been ripped out
                    and then reinstalled, with trailers put in as modular housing for the UN staff.
                    Howe basically didn't want me there, that was pretty clear. April Glaspie he was
                    willing to tolerate because she's not only an Arabist, she was a former
                    ambassador. I had never been an ambassador, and I was a male State Department
                    type, which is generally anathema to a certain mindset in the military.</p>
                <p>He basically wanted me to take over running the pitifully inadequate information
                    education effort that the UN had going there. They didn't even have their own
                    radio station. This is in a country which essentially lived by oral tradition,
                    poetry, and being articulate and fast on your feet verbally. A remarkable lack
                    of comprehension of what Somalia was all about- Quite apart from the chutzpah up
                    front, in your face, confrontational Somali national character. An amazing
                    place.</p>
                <p>Howe was at the end of his string there and demonstrated that even a flag officer
                    in the armed forces of the United States does not have to be a leader. I can
                    remember one 5 minute discussion in a staff meeting that he chaired on what to
                    do with used sandbags. The man found his horizon so circumscribed as to be
                    bounded by used sandbags, a reflection of his own personality as well as the
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, why were we there and where were
                        we, the West, in the scheme of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: In a nutshell, the death of the dictator, Mohamed Said Barre ultimately
                    caused Somalia to fall apart. It fell apart into its components, and its
                    components can best be described by a Somali proverb: “Me against my brother, my
                    brother and I against our cousins, we and our cousins against” and so on and so
                    forth. Your atomic unit was the subclan. It was the family really, but the
                    subclan was the real nuclear unit of Somali society. One of the largest
                    subclans, extending into clans were the Habr Gedir, of which your late Mohamed
                    Aideed's son is the most prominent figure in the Mogadiscio area of Somalia
                    today. There are about 6-12 larger clans like the Habr Gedir and they tend to be
                    geographically based. They have been at war with one another throughout the
                    entire historical period and probably well beyond. The drought and looming
                    famine of the late '80s along with Siad Barre's death caused an implosion in
                    Somali society that essentially resulted in military action by those clans that
                    had the wherewithal to acquire guns. That's what the United Nation's first
                    mission, that was a humanitarian mission, stepped into. It did the job. People
                    did not starve to death in wholesale quantities.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>Then there was pressure - and I cannot recall why, partly because I was in
                    Cambodia at the time with UNTAC - to transform the humanitarian mission into one
                    of nation building, presumably so that Somalia would have the capacity to deal
                    with such emergencies in the future. It wasn't done, probably could not be done.
                    Somalia remains to this very day a nation - in Somalia, everybody speaks Somali,
                    most everybody is a Muslim, but it's not a state. There is no national
                    government. It's also divided into at least two fragments: Somaliland, which the
                    British had under their aegis; and Somalia, which was Italian Somalia until
                    given over to the British after one of the world wars. The third Somali entity
                    is Djibouti, which is made up of Somalis but very heavily under French
                    influence. In fact, the French ambassador who was in Haiti when I was there is
                    currently ambassador in Djibouti.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived, what was the conventional wisdom? Did
                        you talk to the State Department? Were they saying, “We've got to get the
                        hell out of there?” Where were we at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: When I accepted Peter Tarnoff's invitation, I went down and essentially
                    put myself in the hands of the Somali Working Group, which was under the aegis
                    of David Shinn. That working group let me know that we were at the near end of
                    UNOSOM II. This was a month and a half, maybe two, after Blackhawk Down, August
                    of 1993. There was an effort by the U.S. military to capture a number of
                    Aideed's lieutenants, Mohamed Farrah Aideed having been deemed responsible for
                    the death of a number of UN troops who had tried and failed to capture his
                    clandestine radio station. Aideed knew he needed a radio station. Why the UN
                    couldn't figure it out that the UN needed one, too was beyond me at least until
                    I got there and met some of the people in charge.</p>
                <p>The effort to capture Aideed's troops went badly awry. There was inadequate
                    sharing of knowledge about the operation. There was no serious rescue force
                    prepared to go in on the ground if they had to. Helicopters were shot down by
                    rocket propelled grenades, either B40 or B41 model as the Vietnamese named them
                    or RPG2 or RPG 7 if you want the NATO nomenclature. The air was filled with
                    gloom. There was a broad and correct assessment that the UNOSOM II mission had
                    failed, and that that failure would be sealed by pulling out with its tail
                    between its legs in the not too distant future. And that is what happened.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a UN effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, but it was a UN effort with a difference. It was one of those United
                    Nations hybrids that had a major U.S. military component much in the way of the
                    subsequent mission to Haiti which went off in '94 and then became blessed by the
                    UN. The U.S. military was in the UN nominally under the command of a Turkish
                    Force Commander, a general officer, but, in fact, answerable to Washington with
                    a number of stovepiped - a jargon term which means operations that were
                    conducted in secrecy from other elements of the U.S. military or diplomatic
                    efforts, much less from the UN itself. It simply was a hopeless mishmash of
                    incompetent people engaged in a combination of murder and slapstick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these incompetent because of the situation or were
                        they just incompetent people for the task at hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was both. The situation was inherently not understood and thus was not
                    being adequately addressed, and the people in the field certainly in the
                    leadership just simply weren't up to figuring things out and grasping what to
                    do. The political level in the U.S. was also fairly clueless.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did Tarnoff tell you? Was this a thing of “Clean up
                        the mess and get the hell out” or was it “Carry on?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: To the extent I remember, it was not very specific, but it was strongly
                    put to me that Admiral Howe had bad instincts and worse judgment, and that I
                    ought to be able to help provide a bit of a rudder in the right directions. What
                    were those directions? I do not remember anything specific.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Very well put.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hadn't he worked in the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: He had been the head of the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. They
                    should have figured it out then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you and Admiral Howe interface at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Because of having dealt with so many UN people, he thought I was there to
                    get myself a chunk of the action, be “in charge” of something, and “be” rather
                    than “do,” which is a classic UN phenomenon, someone who wants to be at a higher
                    rank with a title rather than to do anything that might expose them to criticism
                    should it not work. Thus, very few UN bureaucrats will take any risk. He didn't
                    seem to understand that I didn't want to be there at all, but as I was there, I
                    would be giving my best advice on a whole range of subjects about which I had
                    some considerable experience, notably including information but also I had been
                    in Vietnam. I don't think he had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was April Glaspie there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, April had gone. She was at that point director of Southern African
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any people within that UN structure, American
                        or others, who you felt knew what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, indeed, there were a fair number of people. There was also a U.S.
                    mission there that had seen Bob Gosende come and go, a former career officer at
                    the Information Service who was ambassador and then left. He had gone, and he
                    was replaced by an officer who has just retired but who's working with AID now,
                    Richard Bogosian. Howe was backed up by a pretty capable staff, a UN information
                    officer who had come out of retirement, an early phenomenon in the nature of
                    “when actually employed.” There was a more junior officer, a fellow who is now
                    DCM in Kampala, who was nominally attached to the UN but they wouldn't pay for
                    him, named Don Teitlebaum. Don had a really good feel for what was going on on
                    the ground. There was also a UN political officer named Ken Menkhaus. Ken knew
                    very well what was going on. There was a Nigerian who seemed to have a clue what
                    was going on. Shortly after I arrived, Bangladesh's former ambassador to the
                    U.S., Ataul Karim, arrived to take the job that Tarnoff said I would be taking,
                    the senior political advisor to Jonathan Howe. Karim you'll recall from my
                    comments on the Cambodian days where he was the non-Cambodian or French-speaking
                    head of the political element of the Special Representative of the Secretary
                    General's office in Phnom Penh. Karim and I to this day get along well. He is
                    very low key. He's smart. But the situation was clearly not going anywhere. In
                    fact, it didn't.</p>
                <p>In early February or late January 1994, a CNN report noted the UN spokesman had
                    said that Admiral Howe would be leaving. This was Admiral Howe's first
                    intimation of that. Rather than play games, he told New York that he was going
                    to leave the end of the first week of February. I decided I had therefore ended
                    my mandate from Under Secretary Tarnoff, and I left the day after Howe did. The
                    entire UN mission pulled out within a couple of months.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I decided that there was a disconnect between the UN Special
                    Representative's Office and staff and the U.S. commander, so I went over and
                    chatted with him, a two star. I'm an Army brat, so I can talk military if I have
                    to, especially with all those additional years in Vietnam and Cambodia when the
                    shooting war was on. It was quite a good chat. It was very candid for the first
                    chat. It's very difficult to say some things. But it was clear that the military
                    seemed to believe it was in a no-win, hopeless situation, and I would guess that
                    was partly as a result of what was coming out of backchannel from the Pentagon
                    on the political side in the U.S. Mr. Clinton was...</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, as he inherited Jean Bertrand Aristide in exile in Washington from
                    Haiti.</p>
                <p>I tried a couple of things. One of them was, there was clearly a need to make
                    some points in the U.S. I tried to prepare for Howe a set of talking points to
                    use with the editorial board of the New York Times and the Washington Post when
                    he was back over Christmas of 1993, and urged that he try to get on NPR and
                    similar radio programs, which he did. He did not need to be sold on that. He
                    just needed to be pushed in that direction a little bit. The man had no judgment
                    in how to do foreign affairs. For example, there is on the Christian side, the
                    Sermon on the Mount in the 8 or 9 Beatitudes. On the Islamic side, there is a
                    very similar set of prescriptions. For example, among the Beatitudes is:
                    “Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called children of God.” Well, if
                    you look in Sura 2, the Cow, of the Koran, you will find about Verse 12 the same
                    thing, but cast in the other direction. The quote is something to the effect of,
                    “There are those who call themselves peacemakers, but it is really they who are
                    the mischief makers on this earth.” Several stanzas further down, you come
                    across, “And woe unto them.” It seemed to me that in the Christmas season, this
                    was a perfect message that could be put in Admiral Howe's remarks for the New
                    Year to the Somali audience. He wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole. “Can't
                    have Christians quoting Muslim scripture.” What nonsense.</p>

                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>CARNEY: I didn't know. The answer is, you never will unless you try. You put that
                    in suspension in the back of your mind and go for it. We did do a couple of good
                    trips upcountry. I worked closely with a fellow who was Special Forces, going
                    off to be the commander in Fort Lewis, and with a fellow who was a nephew or a
                    grand nephew of a former Secretary of State, Stetinnius, who was working on a
                    program that has since become installed all around the world, a sort of ICITAP
                    improvement of the criminal justice system, both by upgrading the police and
                    trying to upgrade the courts. We tried to help broker a relationship in Belet
                    Weyne, where the Germans had succeeded the Italians as the main UN force. Then
                    we were in Baidoa and one other place which I cannot recall the name of, but it
                    was essentially pastoral. Remarkable. It enabled me to acquire some frankincense
                    which proved to be great stocking stuffers for Christmas of 1994. I couldn't
                    find any myrrh. Frankincense is essentially a gum Arabic, and is readily
                    available.</p>
                <p>I got to know Somalis. If you understand what they are, you can deal with them.
                    You make the wrong assumptions and you can be dead. Very interesting place. But
                    just simply the West, and certainly the U.S., did not understand it well enough
                    to make a decision to engage. That was a mistake. That was bad policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that you had picked up the feeling that
                        there are an awful lot of time servers in the UN going for the position as
                        opposed to the job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, that's true. That began to change as you increased the tempo of
                    field missions where, if you didn't produce results, people noticed it. But in
                    the period of most of the UN's history, with the deadlock between the U.S. and
                    the USSR over a number of issues, it did not pay to be a UN bureaucrat who
                    raised your head too high. There were numbers and numbers recruited who learned
                    that lesson. Particularly if you were from the Third World you lived fat, you
                    did little, tried to draw as little attention to yourself as possible except
                    where you would look good rather than necessarily be good. I ran into that on
                    the Cambodia mission. A remarkable bunch of incompetents sent out from the UN
                    headquarters.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: I didn't. I immediately, thanks to April Glaspie, went to Lakhdar Brahimi
                    as Special Political Advisor in the UN observer mission in South Afric(UNOMSA)
                    for the elections that brought Mandela to power. I met a number of characters
                    who will figure in our subsequent chats. Susan Rice was on the NSC staff and
                    became Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. I got to know a number
                    of UN people who I've stayed close to as well a seeing agaiReg Austin, who had
                    been in Cambodia as the head of the electoral unit. He was head of the electoral
                    monitoring aspect of the UN mission in South Africa. He was a Zimbabwean.
                    Interesting mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came right back and went to this election. You were in
                        South Africa from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: In Johannesburg... I want to say I arrived in March, but I will have to
                    check that. I stayed through the election in May. Then Brahimi asked me to stay
                    on an extra month, which I did.</p>
                <p>The election itself was fascinating. First of all, there was a pre-Brahimi
                    mission led by Angela King. She did not have enough horsepower and Brahimi did.
                    He was a former Algerian foreign minister, Special Representative of the UN for
                    the Congo. Then sent to South Africa as the Secretary General's man for the
                    South African elections. Brahimi immediately recognized that I could be
                    enormously useful. He picked the slice of my experience with white South African
                    politics from when I had been political counselor in Pretoria from '83 to '86.
                    Indeed I did know a number of white South African politicians and of course
                    black South African politicians. He had a little stable of special political
                    advisors - an Egyptian who is active now, another American who was a professor
                    at City College, an African specialist who is now in the DC area. I had dinner
                    with him the other night - Herbert Weiss. Brahimi had his own team which has
                    continued with him now, a fellow whose name betrays an Armenian background,
                    Seryadarian, an Iraqi Ala Almaman, who was chief of protocol, is in Bosnia now,
                    if I'm not mistaken rather than in Afghanistan with Brahimi.</p>
                <p>Brahimi was exceedingly good working with the very competent South African
                    negotiators and that negotiating process includeRolf Meyer and Leon Wessels, and
                    the ANC people also engaged in it. The big problem was getting the Zulu prime
                    minister, Gatsha Buthelezi, on board the effort. He had been an early ANC
                    member. He had become creator of the Inkatha Freedom Party, the political wing
                    of the Zulu. Over the years of his return to South Africa, Inkatha had become
                    very independent. The Zulu never accepted to become a Bantustan, to become
                    independent themselves in the vision of the apartheid government so that all
                    black tribes would have their own and rather small quasi independent mini
                    states. The Zulu completely refused ever to buy into that. It looked, and the
                    ANC began criticizing Gatsha because he was so clearly a pole around which Zulu
                    were rallying, rather than joining the ANC itself. Negotiations succeeded in
                    getting Gatsha to participate at the very last minute.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. What was the role of the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The mandate was to monitor the elections and see if they were free and
                    fair. But in fact it was bigger than that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about what you were...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: As nearly as I could tell, a major effort was at facilitating, where
                    needed, early identification of any problems, facilitation of their resolution
                    so that the elections could go forward smoothly.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you get involved?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: April Glaspie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I mean, with this UN mandate, what were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I was basically advising Brahimi on what was going on in white politics
                    and notably in the Afrikaner political elements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was going on with the Afrikaners? This had been the
                        group that had been the most adamantly opposed to black rule.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes. A personal friend of mine was the chief of staff for Frederik Willem
                    De Klerk, the State President. It was De Klerk who had looked at the situation
                    in South African with his close friends and decided that P.W. Botha's, his
                    predecessor's, direction was going to produce chaos if not bloodbath. It was De
                    Klerk and his associates who decided there had to be a negotiation. Mandela had
                    to be let out of jail, and South Africa had to move forward as a non-racial
                    state with apartheid ended. Now, not all Afrikaners agreed. But what De Klerk
                    did was, he set a referendum among whites for the very direction that I've
                    outlined. That referendum passed overwhelmingly. But there were nevertheless
                    strong, armed unhappy, ultraconservative whites who insisted De Klerk was wrong
                    and there could never be a unified, non-racial South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the election approached, was everyone looking at these
                        ultraconservatives and saying, “Is there going to be an assassination or an
                        armed uprising?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There were plenty of incidents. There was a bomb at the airport. There
                    was a major bomb downtown which killed a number of people and set off what could
                    have become a major riot that was damped down. There were clear provocations
                    certainly done by these very right-wing Afrikaners. It didn't work. Mandela was
                    able to keep the lid on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the voting go when you watched this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was interesting. I myself went to Sharpeville of historical fame,
                    where the major riot over Bantu education took place that essentially set South
                    Africa on its course for the last third of the 20th century. I went to a number
                    of other places where there had been serious riots and important killings of
                    rioters and activists. Everybody wanted to vote. The first place we went to was
                    in Soweto. There were two polling stations. There was about to be a riot there
                    because people were breaking into line and the lines were enormous. There
                    weren't quite enough ballot boxes. We helped bring over one of the peacemakers,
                    which was a title given to younger men in their 30s who were part of- (end of
                    tape)</p>
                <p>These young men were part of (black) civil society groups organized to help
                    effect the transition by acting at the very local level to resolve conflicts and
                    disputes. A couple of them came over and restored order. They had the mandate of
                    the ANC and everybody knew it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You stayed on after the election.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes. It turned out that there wasn't any real need to have me around. But
                    Brahimi wanted enough of a staff so that he could do things as needed. I left at
                    the end of July.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be July '94.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I was in Namibia hunting. This would have been about August. I got a
                    telephone call from Robin Raphel. Robin at that time was Assistant Secretary of
                    State for South Asian Affairs. The South Asia Bureau was new at the time, had
                    about 28 employees. The bureau itself had a budget smaller than the embassy in
                    Tokyo. Robin called. She had been refused when she asked about hiring somebody
                    on as her Deputy Assistant Secretary of State. The bureau was so small it only
                    had one DAS. She concluded that I might be a good candidate. So she called up
                    and actually got through on the telephone. She asked if I'd do it. I talked with
                    my wife and said I'd be delighted to come on board. The bureaucracy blessed it
                    and I reported in to the South Asia Bureau in about September of '94.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Until about June of '95.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the South Asia Bureau having been cut off
                        from the Near Eastern Bureau? Was it in limbo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I never knew the Near Eastern Bureau. I had never served in either South
                    Asia or the Near East. The bureau made eminently good sense, except that it
                    clearly should have had added to it the various Stans: Tajikistan, Uzbekistan,
                    maybe even Kazakhstan. But that hasn't happened.</p>
                <p>The issues were important. India was just emerging from its socialist phase and
                    becoming more market economy oriented. Pakistan and India continued at each
                    other's throats, both of them with burgeoning nuclear weapons programs. The
                    Chinese were involved in enhancing Pakistan's nuclear and missile capabilities.
                    The Indians continued to tweak Pakistan and try to beggar it by forcing more and
                    more of its revenues into military expenditures. In the meantime, you had the
                    situation in Bangladesh which was an unhappy political catfight of Begum Zia and
                    Sheik Hasina being the ladies at issue. You had the Tamil Tigers continuing
                    their insurgency in Sri Lanka, an insurgency which as you and I sit here seems
                    to be in the process of mediation. Fascinating place. I had been to Nepal after
                    Vietnam. That was my only experience with the region.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find yourself handling this? What were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Basically the DAS was the bureau manager, so I was working closely with
                    the administrative officer for Near East and South Asian Affairs. I believe
                    those were still together back in those days. I was working especially to
                    recruit officers for the various positions, an annual exercise. Making sure
                    efficiency reports got written. Helping make sure that speeches got written for
                    Robin Raphel, including drafting a speech that she gave at the Asia Society on
                    the U.S. and the region. And then traveling to the field to show policy level
                    interest. A DAS is the lowest policy rung in the State Department. I visited
                    India twice, Pakistan twice, Nepal once, Sri Lanka once.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Afghanistan was off limits at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: For Afghanistan, I went up to Peshawar and spent 24 of the busiest hours
                    I've ever spent literally from breakfast on in meetings with Afghan figures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we trying to do with Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Basically back in those days there were a couple of things we were
                    looking at. We were trying to get the Stingers that were missing back. I was
                    following that. We were trying to broker some sort of arrangement to produce
                    rational government in Kabul. At the same time, we were seeing the Taliban begin
                    their conquests in the Pushtun areas of Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find relations between our embassy in
                        Islamabad and New Delhi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The irony there was, at that time, Frank Wisner had just gotten to New
                    Delhi. Frank is an elemental force. He and I had a very to the point
                    discussions. He was pushing for U.S. tanks for India. I said, “Frank, why would
                    we give the Indians tanks that they could use against Pakistan?” He said, “Oh,
                    no, they want them against the Chinese.” I said, “Frank, this is never going to
                    happen. Let's drop it.” He did. He wouldn't hesitate to call 18 people in
                    Washington behind the Assistant Secretary's back to get something done. I think
                    he figured it out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was the little matter of the Himalayas, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Exactly. Yes, the Chinese were a threat. They had come across the
                    Himalayas. But to my knowledge they were not in tank country when they did so.
                    It was at high altitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very high altitude. In fact, we were having problems with
                        our embassy supply because the Cosmoline kept crystallizing and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Then you had John Monjo as ambassador in Islamabad. John and I go back to
                    Jakarta days where we had one unhappy set of experiences. He was perfectly
                    professional in dealing with the visiting firemen, quite a nice dinner there.
                    John came back and went into the Inspection Corps. I believe he's retired now
                    but continues to inspect.</p>
                <p>Dealing with the Pakistanis was interesting. They had at the time in Washington a
                    former journalist as ambassador who just left about 6 months ago from her second
                    posting under a very different government as ambassador here. She was Meleeha
                    Lodi, who was the essence of all that's good about Pakistanis, which is to say,
                    they're funny, they're smart, you can talk to them about anything, they're never
                    on a high horse, unlike Indians, and they're not pretending to be something they
                    aren't, which Indians and, unfortunately, Americans can do entirely too often.
                    For example, clearly, the embassy in Washington had briefed the foreign ministry
                    on the antecedents of the visiting Deputy Assistant Secretary. The Foreign
                    Secretary when I met him was taking the mickey out of me. “What is your
                    background in South Asian affairs?” He knew I'd never served in the region. I
                    looked at him and said, “Well, aside from a visit to Nepal, I'm considerably
                    informed through the works of George McDonald Fraser.” He looked at me and said,
                    “Ah, Flashman.” He got it. That was it. It broke the ice. We could talk. It
                    didn't take him long to figure out that on those areas of the brief that were of
                    considerably vital interest to the U.S. and Pakistan, I was up to speed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record, Fraser wrote a series of books on
                        Flashman, novels that were very funny but very good historically on dealings
                        during the time of the Great Game in that area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes. In fact, it goes all the way through the wars with the Sikhs, the
                    Sepoy mutiny, everything is covered, as well as any number of Flashman's other
                    experiences in wars of the 19th century, including the U.S. Civil War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was with John Brown, at Custer's last stand, and was
                        sold as a slave. It's a wonderful set of novels.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>Q: Did you find within the bureau... Here these people were untimely ripped from
                    the NEA bureau, which remains a very strong bureau mainly devoted to
                    Arab-Israeli affairs. Did you get a sense of freedom, “Oh, now we can do it on
                    our own” or the fact that they're out of the limelight?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: To a person, the people in the South Asia Bureau were delighted at having
                    gotten away from their colleagues in the Middle East. South Asia had always been
                    neglected. The realities of the issues and U.S. interests in South Asia were not
                    being served in the combined bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did Iran fall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Iran was and is in NEA. Persians with Arabs, what can I say?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find a divided bureau in that there were either
                        Indian hands or Pakistani hands?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I didn't. Everybody had served in both countries. There aren't enough
                    posts. And in Bangladesh as well, East Pakistan, if you will. There weren't
                    enough posts for anyone who specialized in that area to become a client or an
                    advocate of one country over another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling about whither Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: By the time I left, I can't recall whether the Taliban had Kabul or they
                    were marching on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think they came in in '96.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: They were marching on Kabul. The conventional wisdom was that once they
                    got out of the Pushtun areas that they were going to be in trouble. But that did
                    not prove to be the case largely because your Panjshiris were in Kabul at that
                    time, including the chap who was assassinated on September 10, (Mohammed Shah)
                    Massoud. He, (the Uzbek Abdul Rashid) Dostom, and the other leaders could not
                    get together to face the threat of the Taliban.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a concern about “We've got to do something” or
                        was there any feeling that maybe the Taliban would be a good thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>CARNEY: In the South Asia Bureau there was very little feel that the Taliban
                    would be a good thing. They were regarded as too much influenced by conservative
                    Pakistani Islam, and too absolutist in the way they dealt with their own
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that we were letting the
                        Pakistanis, that this was another Somalia and we'd better stay away from
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Nothing like that. Nobody was looking at it that way. There was no
                    interest in the U.S. going back into Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We didn't even have an embassy there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No. Of course, we had the chancery and we had somebody watching it, an
                    old Afghan employee, but there was no resident staff and nobody was accredited
                    from offshore, the argument being that there was no real government in Kabul to
                    be accredited to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Nepal raise any interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It did because a communist prime minister was elected. I met him in
                    December of '94. He didn't stay in office long. He was turfed out in Nepali
                    politicking within a couple of months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about China? Was there a watching brief on China or
                        was there a feeling that China had reached its limits and they weren't
                        moving in or trying to do too much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Everybody accepted the Indian view that their primary threat was from
                    China, but it didn't seem a threat likely ever to materialize. So, everyone
                    would nod sagely when they'd hear that from an Indian and then you'd go on to
                    what's real and what's real was trying to get their economy shaped up. They were
                    in the process of creating that computer mecca at Bangalore. U.S. business was
                    very interested in India, an India that was moving out into the real world
                    economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Kashmir? Was this considered an annoying
                        distraction by us?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Kashmir was one of the real issues. That was one of the briefs that I had
                    to speak to the Pakistanis and the Indians about. I never did get a serious
                    Indian recognition of what was wrong with that place. What was wrong with it
                    was, they didn't want to be part of India, it's as simple as that. I don't to
                    this day know how they're going to resolve that. The Indians do have the power.
                    They are the regional power, there's no doubt about that. But how long they'll
                    let that running sore stay open is...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this as emotional an issue with the Indians as it
                        seems to be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It depended entirely on who you talked to. For some, yes, but by and
                    large, I got the impression it was an issue that was being worked rather than an
                    issue that was passionately held and felt. But then the Indians would often give
                    you mixed signals on how they dealt with issues - it's part of national
                    character - or how they deal with other people, their own families. I never got
                    enough of an understanding of Indians to make a definitive judgment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Pakistan viewed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The problem with Pakistan was, they had ordered all these F-16s from us
                    that we weren't willing to deliver because of the legislative prohibition
                    relating partly to their nuclear weapons effort. There is enough of an India
                    lobby in the U.S. that there are people on the Hill who will delightedly operate
                    legislatively against Pakistan. This was the case. The U.S. was in what I
                    believed to be the unacceptable position of not being willing to deliver the
                    F-16s that had been ordered nor being willing to refund the money that had been
                    paid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the thing I found astounding. This happened with
                        Libya and other places. They pay for planes and then they don't get
                        them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that there would have been enough
                        fuss... I guess once they paid for the planes, then there is no
                        countervailing lobby on the part of the Texans who make the F-16. If they
                        got their money, they don't care.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Anyway, I found it distinctly wrong. It was wrong for the United States
                    to be in that position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Indian lobby?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Arrogant for the most part. Unrealistic. An odd bunch of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's an emerging group like the Jewish lobby and the Greek
                        lobby.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Except that the Indians would turn around and shoot themselves in the foot often
                    enough that this group would have to reform and go into damage control, rather
                    than being able to push forward. Now, what's happened with the Jewish lobby is
                    something similar in the last couple of years, but that's a relatively newer
                    phenomenon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Robin Raphel as an administrator of this
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, Robin had the problem that she was perceived as having gotten the
                    job - she went from political counselor in Delhi to Assistant Secretary of State
                    - solely because she had been at Oxford the same time Bill Clinton had been
                    there and was regarded as a friend of Bill, which was not, as I saw it, the
                    case. She had an entree because of that old friendship, but it had nothing to do
                    with the way she was able to do business on the scene. First of all, she is very
                    smart and her focus is totally policy-oriented. She is an economist basically
                    but... I enjoyed working with her. She had a way to pick out the important
                    issues and she also had a pretty good disabused view of people that she was
                    working with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for a relatively short time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes. That was bizarre.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in '95?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I left there because in October of '94 I got a letter from (Director
                    General) Genta Hawkins saying, “Thank you, you're TIC'ed out, goodbye” and then
                    I got a telephone call from (Undersecretary for Management) Dick Moose saying,
                    “How would you like to be ambassador to Sudan?” I said to Dick, “Dick, that
                    wouldn't be my first choice.” I said I'd talk with Vicki and get back to him in
                    the next day. I hung up and my secretary, Sue Shay, had been listening on the
                    telephone and came in and said, “Hmm, all beach, no ocean.” Great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You accepted this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes. As Robin said to me, “You know, you're out if you don't do this. I'm
                    not going to quibble about it at all.” Gib Lanpher replaced me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in the Sudan from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I started reading in in January of '95. I had my confirmation hearing in
                    late May. I arrived at post in mid-August and presented credentials September
                    11, 1995.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: On February 7, 1996, the entire diplomatic and administrative and
                    technical staff of the mission was withdrawn. We wound up living in Nairobi at a
                    much reduced level of staff with one consular officer resident in Cairo. We
                    commuted monthly to Khartoum ostensibly because it was not safe to be resident
                    in Khartoum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did this all end?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: For me it ended November 30, 1997, when I left Khartoum to come back and
                    read in in detail and go on to Haiti.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Let's talk about the Sudan. What was the situation
                        in '95?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The situation was bad. As David Shinn, who was then Director for East
                    African Affairs said, there was some doubt that there would even be a U.S.
                    embassy resident in Khartoum. There was doubt on three accounts. The first was,
                    my predecessor had apparently been recommending that we reconsider having an
                    embassy there. The second is that we were about to refuse agrement for the man
                    whom Khartoum had designated as ambassador to Washington. The third was, there
                    was an increasing surveillance of embassy American staff by non-Sudanese and
                    some by Sudanese themselves in Khartoum itself, as well as a heightened rhetoric
                    against the United States allegedly seen as arming the (rebel) SPLA, seeking an
                    overthrow of the authorities in Khartoum, and otherwise plotting against the
                    Sudan as shown by the various trials related to events in New York City.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>This resulted from the reality that a coup d'etat in 1989 had overthrown the
                    elected leader, a modern figure, but from a traditional political movement,
                    Sadiq El-Mahdi, whose millenarian great grandfather had defeated Chinese Gordon,
                    Governor General of the Sudan in 1885. The people who took over were essentially
                    political Islamists with allegiance to the National Islamic Front whose
                    intellectual figure was, and to a degree, remains to this day, Hassan Abdullah
                    Turabi. The coup itself was run by a major general - at the time, he might even
                    have been a brigadier general - Omar Bashir, who is to this day president of the
                    Sudan. The U.S. opposed the coup, as we do with such events against elected
                    leaders anywhere.</p>
                <p>The political Islamists thought political Islam was on a roll around the world
                    and began disrespecting American interests, notably by inviting terrorism
                    financier Osama Bin Laden to take up residence, which he did in '93; by becoming
                    a locus of something called the Popular Arab and Islamic Conference PAIC), that
                    held an activist Islamist venting session annually, and by expanding relations
                    with Middle Eastern terrorist groups. The new authorities were also prosecuting
                    vigorously the civil war against the south, whose grievances had long been
                    regarded as legitimate by Americans among others, and violating human rights in
                    Khartoum as well. It was not a happy time in relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go with your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I did. I told Dick Moose that I would not go without my wife. In fact, my
                    predecessor had figured out that previous withdrawals of non-essentials and
                    dependents were based on information of no real substance. He had gotten
                    Washington to change the no dependents rule in late '94/early '95.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem in getting confirmed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Absolutely not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, if you want to go there...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: You can go. Nancy Kassebaum was the only person on the Committee (when a
                    number of us going to Africa went for confirmation hearings).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they telling you on the desk before you went out
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, I pretty much repeated... I was reading in, so I was seeing the
                    cables as well as listening to David Shinn and Joe Fishbein, the Sudan desk
                    officer. You had a huge humanitarian relief effort underway. The Sudanese
                    government and the main rebel faction had signed an agreement which permitted
                    the United Nations to create an Operation Lifeline Sudan. That operation was
                    flying food and medical relief into an enormous number of destinations in the
                    south except when they would be denied. You had the International Committee of
                    the Red Cross active in both Khartoum and in the south with a several hundred
                    bed hospital at the UN operations base and airstrip in northwestern Kenya at
                    Lokichokio. You had an alphabet soup of NGOs there, Catholic Relief Services,
                    CARE, Norwegian People's Aid, the latter was not part of OLS, and is widely
                    regarded as helping smuggle arms to the SPLA. Very complicated.</p>
                <p>In the period I was ambassador you saw the resurrection of two issues. One was
                    slavery and the other was religious persecution, both attributed to the
                    intolerance or the active prosecution by the government of Sudan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you welcomed when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: By Lufthansa late at night. We had come from Brussels, where we had
                    stayed with friends, and had picked up probably salmonella poisoning. Very hot
                    summer and there was a very good coq au vin. My wife had a worse case of it than
                    I did. Basically we got into Khartoum and the Chief of Protocol was at the plane
                    to welcome us, the DCM or charg� d'affaires in fact, a couple of staff as well.
                    We went over to the residence, quite a nice residence. A glass of champagne with
                    everybody. Tumbled into bed and went into the office the next day where my wife
                    duly visited the nurse practitioner who is still there, a Scotswoman married to
                    a Sudanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find you dealt with the government, with
                        Bashir?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: When I presented credentials September 11, we did the ceremony not in the
                    presidential palace which had leaked due to a heavy rainstorm, but in a
                    different, modern building. He invited me to sit down and we talked a little bit
                    about some of the issues, including a UN C-130 that had been denied flight
                    clearance by the Sudanese authorities. I suggested that he revisit that issue. I
                    noted US concern with “foreign guests,” implying the terrorist groups. He
                    suggested I travel all around Sudan. I promised to keep the Foreign Minister
                    busy with requests to do so.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>I got hold of the public affairs officer who was the only real serious Arabist at
                    post; she spoke great Arabic. We began an immediate effort to know the Sudanese
                    press, had them all over to the residence for an evening, including Sudan TV
                    with a camera crew that arrived. Started under, at her suggestion, small
                    meetings with intellectuals in the National Islamic Front, and was basically in
                    a mode to listen, which these people found refreshing.</p>
                <p>I think also they had begun to figure out that political Islam really wasn't on a
                    worldwide roll, and that Sudan had to be more responsible to take its place in
                    the international community. This had been particularly driven home to them
                    because on June 26, not quite two months before I arrived, the Sudanese had been
                    exposed as having been accomplices before and after the fact of the attempted
                    assassination of (Egyptian President) Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa, where he had
                    gone for an OAU summit. The hit failed, and three suspects fled back to Sudan
                    and they were traced in flight. They had clearly benefitted from serious support
                    by the External Security Bureau of the Sudanese government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this security bureau acting independently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: They were not acting independently of Turabi and the party, but it isn't
                    clear to me that Bashir at his level was witting of the extent of support and of
                    the details of the operation. He fired the head of the External Security Bureau
                    and was very short with Turabi. Turabi suggested at one point that Bashir come
                    over and discuss it. Bashir said, “I'm the president. You'll come over and see
                    me.” There was a little testiness in their relationship, a testiness that
                    ultimately three years later resulted in Turabi's eclipse politically, and then
                    his being put in prison three more months later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we trying to do regarding these various
                        terrorist groups which had set up their nests within the Sudan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The answer changes over time. In 1995 to start out with, we were trying
                    to get the Sudanese government to monitor the groups that we thought were
                    surveilling our people and bring that surveillance to a halt. That was the first
                    thing we were trying to do. There were several demarches made to that
                    effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our concern being what?</hi>

                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Personal security, fear that there would be some sort of terrorist
                    operation against our people. We were also trying to get the Sudanese government
                    to recognize that it was not acceptable to support international terrorism, that
                    terror was not an acceptable way to go about changing things. I think the
                    Sudanese had accepted that by May of 1996 when they asked Osama Bin Laden to
                    leave at our behest. This is a very complicated aspect of the relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Osama Bin Laden at that point, how did we view him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: We viewed him as an important terrorism financier resident in Sudan,
                    that's all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before the bombings of our embassies in Dar Es
                        Salaam and Nairobi.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: That (bombing) was '98. Khobar Towers and what have you were in '96. Bin
                    Laden was not implicated in any specific acts of terror or murder except against
                    the Soviets in Afghanistan, where he earned his reputation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was this massive relief effort in the Sudan for the

                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Well, there were millions of (displaced) southerners in the north who
                    were getting relief as well. Clearly, the government then didn't have to provide
                    relief for its own people. That was one. The other thing is that because the
                    government gave the okay on flight destinations, it could to a degree control
                    where that relief went. If there had been no agreement, Katie, bar the door.
                    Anybody could have flown anything in that the Kenyans permitted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Sudanese didn't have the capability of stopping
                        these flights.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No. Their air force was minuscule. Since '95, they have acquired
                    helicopter gunships, but no air defense aircraft to the best of my
                    knowledge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of oil there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>CARNEY: None at that point. The area from whence oil was being pumped - and that
                    pumping began in '98 - had been proved by Chevron before it left Sudan about
                    1983. That concession had been acquired by a Vancouver, Canada company named
                    after Frank Herbert's favorite planet, Arakis, in his novel “Dune.” That company
                    sold out to Talisman, which is itself in the process of trying to sell to the
                    Indians. The exploitation area in the south is an area peopled by the Nuer tribe
                    just south of the political dividing line between north and south Sudan. Since
                    '98, you've been pumping about between 200,000 and 350,000 barrels of oil a day.
                    It's worth about half a billion dollars to the Sudanese government. The Chinese
                    take all the oil that is not actually refined in Sudan for the Sudan's own
                    needs. The Chinese have 40% of the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But when you were there, they hadn't come on line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, but it was being formed. Occidental was looking into moving there.
                    One of the NSC people basically leaked all the details of that to the
                    “Washington Post,” where it duly appeared and helped scare Occidental off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Sudan at one point was a great grain source. How stood
                        Sudan economically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Sudan is in an interesting situation. It's a million square miles in
                    surface area. It's the biggest country in Africa. It has 29-30 million people.
                    The Nile forms at Khartoum itself. The two main sources are the Blue Nile and
                    the White Nile, the Blue Nile from Ethiopia and the White Nile from Uganda.
                    Another major tributary from Ethiopia, is the Atbara. You have an enormous
                    potential for grain. Some of that potential is realized in an area known as the
                    Gezira, that is between the Blue and White Nile rivers. The British created a
                    gravity flow irrigation system there which grows cotton and sorghum.</p>
                <p>Sudan could do a lot more with the water. There is a sugar enterprise established
                    on the White Nile about 200 kilometers south of Khartoum which is known as
                    Kenana. In the last growing season, they produced 400,000 tons of cane sugar. I
                    was down there in January (2003).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling that Sudan should concentrate on
                        developing its wealth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, the entire discussion on Sudan was overwhelmed by political Islam, by
                    the terrorism question, by the civil war, and by human rights questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Human rights was completely concerned with the south or

                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>CARNEY: No, by no means. There were a range of human rights concerns. You had
                    suppression of political rights in the north including abduction into ghost
                    houses, beatings, and interrogations there. You had an element of the sort of
                    fundamentalist approach that's more common in Saudi Arabia where the relatively
                    high position of women was seemingly being put at risk. That never really
                    materialized. You had the issue of abductions of African tribes by Arab nomads
                    known as “slavery” tolerated by the government. You had the question of
                    intolerance towards Christians which took the form in the Khartoum area of the
                    refusal to permit more churches to be built but not actual closing or
                    prohibition of church going; and then a strong effort to create rice or- (end of
                    tape)</p>
                <p>A strong effort to create rice or millet Christians among the refugees from the
                    south. Of course, there was no possibility to change the government peacefully.
                    The coup government was in charge. Major set of human rights concerns, all of
                    them in the context of a welcome to this alphabet soup of Middle Eastern
                    terrorist groups.</p>
                <p>Action against U.S. interests: Support of Iraq, for example, during the Gulf War.
                    And then our own bad intelligence. In late January of 1996, the CIA formally
                    withdrew 140 reports that had been filed in '93 or thereabouts that had been the
                    basis for reducing staff and withdrawing dependents. The source was deemed a
                    fabricator and embellisher. A second source in late 1995 argued a plot by
                    Sudanese authorities against Tony Lake's life (in the first Clinton
                    administration he was Advisor to the President for National Security Affairs).
                    That source was dropped, ultimately deemed... It was a very complicated
                    situation. When the Sudanese in March of 1996 began to respond to U.S. concerns
                    on the terrorism front, it was not taken seriously in Washington for a couple of
                    reasons that did not become clear for years and years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the reasons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The first one was, the track record was so bad you had to be skeptical
                    whether Khartoum was serious. But in fact, they booted Bin Laden out in May of
                    '96. In late June of '96, they let someone come out from Washington to
                    photograph two (military) training camps that we asked to visit. I was on that
                    trip, so I know it happened. Then in early '97, there was a letter from
                    (President) Bashir to President Clinton and from Foreign Minister Taha to new
                    Secretary of State Albright inviting U.S. counterterrorism teams to come and
                    discuss American concerns with Sudanese officials, none of which were ever
                    seriously responded to. Strobe Talbott ultimately responded as Acting Secretary
                    2 or 3 months later.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: The NSC was hard over. Dick Clarke and Susan Rice.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No willingness to test the Sudanese to see if they were serious. I
                    believe that this was ultimately explained because Ms. Rice and her
                    collaborators genuinely believed the Ethiopians, Eritreans, and Ugandans were
                    going to give enough support to the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army to
                    cause enough victories by the SPLA to collapse the regime in Khartoum. That was
                    never stated policy. Stated U.S. policy was always to get Khartoum to change
                    what it did, NOT to see a change of regime in Khartoum. But in fact, that second
                    agenda seems to have bee there. That agenda finally failed when Eritrea and
                    Ethiopia went to war in '98.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Exactly. Basically Uganda and Ethiopia in particular were very active and
                    in direct support of major SPLA military efforts beginning about March of '97.
                    Those efforts succeeded in taking some important garrison towns in the south but
                    didn't go as far as Juba, which is essentially the capital of the south. It is
                    to this day in government hands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you and Washington view this civil war... Did you see
                        a split there that maybe eventually it would become a nation? It seems hard
                        to think that a non-Muslim south and a racially different south was going to
                        take over the north of Sudan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: That was never going to happen. Anyone who would have thought that would
                    simply not have understood what Sudan's all about. The most that would have
                    happened was, the north would have let the south go, secede. That is a
                    possibility today in the peace negotiations that are going on in Kenya.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: We were not. U.S. policy has always been, if Sudan can preserve its
                    integrity, so much the better. Creating yet another landlocked state in central
                    Africa doesn't make any sense unless there's no other way.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: Of course. They must. The Nile is so utterly vital to Egypt that Egypt is
                    paralyzed around the question of the Sudan with, too often, Egyptian hopes and
                    fears outriding their analyses.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: There wasn't one. Their relations were so bad that they did not have
                    ambassadors in each other's countries. The charg� d'affaires was a nice young
                    man but he wasn't important. It was the Egyptian intelligence people on the
                    scene who were the important ones. I would go to Cairo when I was in my offshore
                    phase regularly, as I did to Asmara and Addis Ababa and Kampala and talk with
                    the principals about Sudan: to the head of Egyptian intelligence, Omar Suleiman;
                    to (President) Isaias Afwerki in Eritrea; and (President) Meles Zenawi in
                    Ethiopia; and to Yoweri Museveni in Kenya; and of course to Daniel Arap Moi once

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Washington had questions about two particular camps. The assertion was
                    that not only were these alphabet soup terrorist groups doing R&amp;R in Sudan,
                    but they were also engaged in actual military training. The one camp we went to
                    was the military academy. It was the wrong season. The camp was empty. It's the
                    cool season that the cadets are there. But there were some facilities of
                    interest and they were duly photographed. The next camp we went to had people in
                    training, but they were put to us as being members of the militia, something the
                    National Islamic Front created when they came to power, sort of a popular
                    militia, paramilitary types who backed up the military in fighting in the south.
                    To the extent I could judge - and I do not speak Arabic - they were indeed
                    Sudanese. They certainly didn't look like Arabs from other countries in the
                    Middle East, as dark as Sudanese tend to be. They were field-stripping AK-47s
                    and otherwise engaging in that kind of training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your relations with non-governmental
                        organizations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>CARNEY: There were more of them there than there were terrorist groups. Basically
                    we had an AID office there programmed for humanitarian affairs. They were the
                    principal contact with the U.S. NGOs anyway. Naturally I would have them over to
                    the residence whenever I could and would brief them. Every time I commuted in,
                    there would be a morning briefing for the NGOs. Good relationship. I would see
                    their opposite numbers in Nairobi and I would go into the south to look at their
                    operations in the south as well, telling Khartoum that I was ambassador to all
                    of the Sudan and hence I would be going into the south, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about this? What were you finding in the south? Was
                        there a government there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Not really. It was essentially a military government. The SPLA has a
                    political movement, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement that was created in
                    response to just these questions and criticisms that they don't really have a
                    government, that it's a military government. I'll be there the end of next
                    month, so I'll be able to tell you whether there's one there yet or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a unified movement or was this just an endemic
                        thing that had been going on...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The rebellion started in 1955. The first phase ended in 1973 with a 10
                    year hiatus and then it resumed due to some political clumsiness and bad faith
                    on the part of the then dictator of Sudan, Jaffar Nimieri. The movement that
                    helped resurrect the civil war in 1983 became the SPLA. It's essentially a
                    movement of the Dinka ethnic majority, but has greatly broadened over the past
                    20 years. They have had considerable difficulty bringing other ethnic groups
                    along with them, a problem of the south, and that is one of the realities of
                    Sudan today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went down there, what were you saying? “Can't you
                        all learn to live in peace with each other?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No. I was saying to the southerners, “If you're going to fight a
                    rebellion against the north to have your grievances, that are legitimate,
                    redressed, it is not effective if you're so disunited. It seems to me that as
                    the largest of the movements, the SPLA has the responsibility to make the
                    compromises that would effect unity.” That was my position with the southerners,
                    with the Dinka. (SPLA/M leader John) Garang and I further talked about that in
                    May of 2001. I had a chat with him in Nairobi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in Khartoum, what was the embassy
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Let's take the period after February of '96 when we were offshore. The
                    Secretary's instruction was that the embassy stay open with flag up every day
                    and the FSN staff at work. Periodically one of the American members would
                    commute in and stay a week or 10 days. We never were permitted to stagger it in
                    such a way that there was always an American present but at least half the month
                    there was an American present. This was a hell of a way to run a railroad. The
                    AID office director was an American woman married to a Sudanese. She stayed
                    until the cruise missile attack of August of '98 and then she was withdrawn to
                    Kenya, but she's back now. It was very difficult. There is a requirement
                    annually for the chief of mission to certify the adequacy of management
                    controls. I signed it the first year, June of '96. In '97, I refused to sign it.
                    I sent a cable in saying, “I will not sign any such undertaking because I do not
                    believe we have effective management controls in the circumstances.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about this rather peculiar thing of moving out
                        but coming back in. It doesn't seem to make much sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The precedent was what the Secretary's office drew on to fight off the
                    importunities of (CIA Director) John Deutch and (Secretary of Defense) Bill
                    Perry, who wanted the whole mission closed - Perry because he'd have to evacuate
                    it, and Deutch because the CIA station had fled in mid-December already, and the
                    fact that nothing had happened was putting their position increasingly in an
                    impossible situation. The precedent was found in Lebanon when the mission was
                    drawn offshore to Cyprus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like the station, the CIA presence, in the Sudan
                        had been crying wolf and nothing had happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: That is basically it, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Perry being there as Secretary of Defense-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Was worried about having to devote assets and fly them more than 1,000
                    miles to effect an evacuation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a long way to get people out of there if you're
                        going to do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: He was relying on Deutch, his former deputy, to advise him on the
                    politics of Sudan, not willing to trust the State Department's view.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got these orders, did you try to turn them
                        around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: We had worked against them since November of '95, including a trip back
                    to Washington to talk to Dick Moose and his people, and then to meet in the
                    situation room at the White House on the issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that State gave in on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Because (Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs) George Moose
                    had no stomach for a fight. Dick Moose was only concerned about protecting
                    Americans, and nobody else was willing to take Deutch on. Deutch changed his
                    mind when I chatted with him in Nairobi in April or May of 1996, and then again
                    in Washington in June of '96.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It does seem like sort of a write-off of the Sudan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, it did. It struck me as not in the interests of the United States. I
                    made the point repeatedly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You kept up with this until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I was in Khartoum for three weeks last month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I'm talking about as ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Until November 30, 1997.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you replaced by somebody?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, I'm the last accredited U.S. ambassador to Sudan.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this, you keep going back there. Have things
                        changed? How do you feel about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Things have changed. That's what is interesting about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has it gotten more dangerous?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Far from it. What happened, and again this is partly speculative, once it
                    became clear that the regional allies could not be counted on to cause the
                    collapse of the government in Khartoum, the Clinton administration changed
                    policies. In May of 2000 the Clinton Administration sent an FBI-CIA
                    counterterrorism team with a 6 point agenda to deal with the Sudanese
                    authorities on U.S. concerns about terrorism. When I visited in January of 2001,
                    just before the inauguration, I spoke with the head of the External Security
                    Bureau and his deputy. I was retired at this point for more than a year. They
                    said they thought they had satisfied all 6 of the American concerns. The Bush
                    Administration apparently agreed because in May of 2001, they asked Chester
                    Crocker to be special envoy to the President for Sudan. Crocker turned it down.
                    The Administration several months later turned to Senator John Danforth, who
                    accepted and was rolled out in a Rose Garden ceremony on September 3, 2001. The
                    events of September 11th caused some to think that Sudan should be a target, but
                    Colin Powell by the end of October publicly said Sudan had satisfied U.S.
                    concerns on terrorism issues.</p>
                <p>Senator Danforth began his work and in January of 2002 succeeded in getting the
                    two main protagonists in the fighting, the government and the SPLA, to satisfy
                    his 4 conditions to show willingness to have the U.S. help mediate a solution.
                    In July of 2002, on the 20th, the government and the SPLA signed a memorandum of
                    understanding at Machakos, Kenya agreeing on the two most contentious issues
                    dividing them. One was the question of the extension of Islamic law which was to
                    be a subject of local/provincial referendum. The other was a timetable after
                    which the south would have a referendum to see if it wanted to stay united or to
                    secede: Six and a half years. After that, beginning in August, when I happened
                    to be in Khartoum on a separate trip, they began the peace talks to
                    operationalize that memorandum of understanding and continue with the next
                    session set for the end of March, along with an interim session on a different
                    track set for the 4th of March to discuss the fate of three areas that are
                    formally part of the north of Sudan that want to be part of the south.</p>

                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>CARNEY: I was a little surprised because I had gone for my confirmation hearing
                    in October for ambassador to Haiti. The Senate approved on November 16th. I said
                    “Goodbye” and then went from Khartoum to Washington to start reading in on
                    Haiti. My wife joined me and we spent Christmas with her folks in Spokane and
                    arrived in Port-au-Prince on January 8, 1998. I presented credentials a
                    week-</p>
                <p>Q: You were there for how long?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: Until the end of December 1999.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Haiti when you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: If you look in the “New York Review of Books,” you will see in the March
                    edition a long description of what Haiti's all about taken in the guise of a
                    review of a book that's just come out on “Haiti, Predatory Republic.” It was in
                    the presidency of Rene Preval who had been the alter ego in many ways of Jean
                    Bertrand Aristide, and selected for the presidency because the Haitian
                    constitution will only let you have one term at a time. You can have another
                    term, but it cannot be consecutive. Aristide was reinstalled by the U.S. in '94.
                    That became a UN mission shortly thereafter. He stepped down in '95 at the
                    insistence of the White House. His term had started 5 years earlier. Preval was
                    elected and ran a non-government for 5 years, holding the place warm for
                    Aristide to return. The country went to hell politically; in terms of drug
                    transit center; and economically, and that's where it is now under Aristide's
                    resumed presidency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our concerns with Haiti?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Our concern was no governance, no development, insufficient effort at
                    stalling the drug transit trade from the Cali cartel in Colombia that would send
                    its go-fast boats on a 10 hour trip with a ton of cocaine to Haiti to be
                    transshipped through the Dominican Republic to Puerto Rico and home free to the
                    U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you find when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: A traffic jam. We got there on a Sunday, thank God, when there isn't a
                    traffic jam. But on Monday, every car that failed the Florida inspection was
                    sent off to Haiti. Haiti's not very big. It's 8,000 square miles. 25,000 square
                    kilometers. Just amazing. Eight million people. No trees except at the embassy
                    residence, which had one of the larger forests and bird sanctuaries on that part
                    of the island. People who simply wouldn't get together for the national good.
                    Remarkable. A polity that was fragmented with Jean Bertrand Aristide at his
                    retirement residence essentially running things, or putting spanners in things
                    that he didn't want to see run.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view the Aristide style... What was he? He was
                        touted as being our guy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, but he wasn't. He was more of the same (style of traditional
                    predatory Haitian leader). A great pity. He could have been so much more, but he
                    wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prior to that, there had been the Duvalier stuff, the

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: He was a priest. He became political while he was a priest and then he
                    essentially left the priesthood in order to marry. He's got two children now.
                    His wife is said to be corrupt. He himself certainly tolerates corruption as a
                    way of using and manipulating people. Interesting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he just biding time to come back again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, no question. Whenever I'd ask Washington for a policy review, I'd
                    get sent Tony Lake, who was by now in his new career but also sort of a dollar a
                    year man for the U.S. government. Lake was the one who was so fond of Aristide.
                    He's even a godfather to one of Aristide's daughters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any disillusionment there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: On Tony Lake's part?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, absolutely, but no effective way of dealing with Aristide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As ambassador, how did you deal with the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>CARNEY: At all the levels on all the issues that we had with them whether it was
                    trying to make sure the airport was secure, and I dealt with the prime minister
                    on that one. We threatened to end U.S. flights to that airport. I was prepared
                    to do it. The airport became secure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was just lack of access controls and lack of will to enforce them
                    where they did exist. That's a small thing. I did get the Attorney General,
                    Janet Reno, to increase the size of the DEA office from one person to 8. Here we
                    were arguing that Haiti was a transit point for 15-20% of the cocaine arriving
                    in the U.S. and we had one DEA guy there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the Colombian dealers more or less bought
                        their...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: They were in the process of doing that. They have done so to a much
                    greater extent now, I understand, but nobody has stayed bought anymore, and I'm
                    told the Colombians are now starting to bypass Haiti just because it's such a
                    mess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the boat people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: We continued to monitor that but that issue had ended well before I got
                    there. We would monitor the building of boats so we had an idea of when they
                    were ready to go. And the Coast Guard would interdict these migrants at sea and
                    we would just return them to the port of Port-au-Prince, give them enough money
                    to make their way back home by bus.</p>
                <p>But the problem and the salvation of Haiti is its diaspora, mainly in the U.S.
                    Anywhere from 400-800 million dollars a year gets sent back to Haiti and it's a
                    margin of survival on the one hand, and a margin of fees to buy your way onto a
                    boat for others. It was the most unusual situation because, to his credit,
                    (Deputy Secretary of State) Strobe Talbott knew that things were going to hell
                    in Haiti and Bill Swing had tried to keep a lid on the reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill Swing had been ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, before me. And I took the lid off. We actually had Fulton Armstrong,
                    the NSC Haiti staffer, and David Greenlee from the State Department, who was
                    Special Haiti Coordinator, come down and argue for the suppression of reporting,
                    which I just laughed at. I said, “What are you going to do, send me to
                    Haiti?”</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The problem was with the Hill, which was looking at Haiti and saying,
                    “What are you guys doing down there?” They were getting obfuscations. This was
                    the earlier period when Jim Dobbins was accused of lying to the Senate, and they
                    believe it to this day, confirmed by the State Department Inspector General on
                    the issue. Dobbins was on the NSC staff, a special guy for Haiti, having
                    replaced Dick Clarke. Fulton Armstrong was in there with either Jim or his
                    successor. It was foolish. Luckily, when I would come up to Washington, I would
                    be candid with people on the Hill, my argument being, “Yes, how are we going to
                    deal with it? This is an approach that may or may not work,” but I could never
                    get a policy review.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was overlying the whole thing, “If we don't do something
                        there, you're going to have a hemorrhaging of boat people coming out?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: (The worry was that) it wasn't going to hold together long enough for our
                    Administration to be over. That's was what was going on.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There was the Black Caucus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How seriously did they take it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Very seriously. I had Mr. John Conyers (D-MI) down a couple of times.
                    Charlie Rangel (D-NJ) was there. Senator Dewine (R-OH) was regularly there.
                    Senator Bob Graham (D-FL) as well. There was a lot of interest in Haiti.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: It was going south.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what would they say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: They would say to Aristide, “You've got to do the right thing” and
                    Aristide would say, “Of course” and he wouldn't. It was interesting. It's now
                    broadly recognized that Aristide is part of the problem and in a way part of the
                    solution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But do you feel realistically that there's any
                        answer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Oh, sure, you've got to get rid of Aristide, but it isn't anything I
                    would say publicly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We got rid of the-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The Haitians have got to get rid of Aristide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but I mean even if you get rid of Aristide, is the
                        society such that it's like Somalia - somebody else will come up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Possibly. There is no guarantee in a place like Haiti.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an international presence there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: A Representative of the Secretary General was there, a former British
                    foreign affairs officer, Julian Harston was there. He was replaced by an
                    Equatorial Guinean. There was a UN police effort helping to train the police,
                    helping to professionalize and modernize them. It was basically undercut,
                    undermined, and defeated largely by Aristide and those cronies around him who
                    seek their own material advantage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, with Aristide, material advantage was what was coming
                        out of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: To give Aristide his due, it isn't so much that he likes to live well.
                    It's that he knows so many people do that they'll do what he wants in order to
                    get access to it. It's a tool rather than an end. Power is what he wants.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the ambassador, did you feel you were doing more than
                        keeping your finger in the dyke?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There were some things we were doing that were positively good - the
                    humanitarian aspects of our AID project, for example. Half a million kids got
                    lunch from our monies every school day. There were some efforts at microcredit
                    underway to help bring together a much broader entrepreneurial class at the very
                    basic level. Those were serious, useful things. The efforts by the U.S. Coast
                    Guard to help mentor a Haitian coast guard that would have its role not only in
                    saving lives but also in drug suppression was sound and well founded. But that's
                    very few. The ultimate problem was the desire on the part of those who held
                    power to use the police and the judiciary as a tool for their own
                    self-aggrandizement. That's what Aristide is all about.</p>
                <p>In the long run, the fostering of a civil society in Haiti was the most important
                    aspect of American aid to Haiti in the second half of the 90s.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have a problem with you and your officers of looking at this and not
                    throwing up your hands and saying, “Oh, the hell with this?”</p>
                <p>CARNEY: Absolutely not, for the most part. Once it became clear that I wanted
                    Washington to know what was going on, that's what my officers did. Let me also
                    say that it was by no means the most brilliant set, as a set, in my Foreign
                    Service experience. But the staff was plenty good enough to figure out what was
                    going on, to write it up, and to send it to Washington. The economic side was
                    particularly good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's hard for people to go to a place where you're dealing
                        with losers.</hi>

                <p>CARNEY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of us have felt this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Like Tom Enders in Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At a certain point, you say, “Oh, God, why am I here?” You
                        want to be with people who have a certain dynamism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: That was mitigated a bit by a belief that Washington wasn't doing enough,
                    that to a degree it was somewhat our fault, it wasn't just the Haitians.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Oh, yes, and in some circles he still has it. Parts of the Black Caucus
                    to this day say, “The only problem is, we're not supporting Aristide enough.”
                    Many of those people are on the board of the foundation which Aristide
                    created.</p>

                        fascinating. You ended up in our last session with some real winners:
                        Somalia, Sudan, and Haiti.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I joke that I looked at the progression and decided I'd better put my
                    papers in. They might have been going to send me to Washington next.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is November 26, 2003. This is an addendum to a
                        previous interview. Tim has in his retirement gotten involved in the Iraq
                        war. Could you tell me how you got involved and what you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I'd be delighted. It was basically an odd way to get into it. My first
                    notion that things were beginning to look serious in Iraq was in November 2002
                    when I was invited to the U.S. Institute of Peace on November 25 for a session
                    on lessons learned in previous peacekeeping efforts that might be applicable to
                    administering Iraq. The meeting at USIP brought together a number of people with
                    experience in previous peacekeeping missions - myself in Cambodia, for example,
                    Peter Galbraith in former Yugoslavia, Bob Perito for his efforts in Haiti and
                    peacekeeping and civil police work in general, a fairly large number of other
                    people, all of whose names I do not recall. Elliott Abrams, then on the NSC
                    staff, was the notable participant in the meeting. The agenda was to look at a
                    number of key questions. The one that received the most focus was screening or
                    vetting the Iraqi civil service to determine who was unacceptable, who one had
                    to hold their nose and keep in order to run a bureaucracy effectively. We talked
                    about civil police. We spoke about the need for an effective media and a number
                    of other topics were judged as well.</p>
                <p>I had basically dropped out of anything related to Iraq after that. I had a
                    couple of other projects on my own.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you had any feel at the time as an informed layman of
                        the situation in Iraq?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I didn't have much of a feel for Iraq at all. I had never served in the
                    Middle East. Sudan is in the Africa Bureau. I don't speak Arabic, don't pretend
                    to be an Arabist. I was vaguely aware that in April of 2002 the State Department
                    had begun its Future of Iraq project, but I had no substantive knowledge of it
                    whatsoever. It just seemed to me to be a good idea. But I knew that if indeed we
                    were going to go to war there, we had to have a sensible idea of what to do in
                    the post-war period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This group that was talking about Iraq at the Institute of

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: If there was a thrust, it was that administering Iraq was going to be
                    complicated and needed a lot more thought. I understand from one of my
                    colleagues in the consulting job that I do now, that there was an effort by the
                    NSC to put a team together at about the same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what happened to you? This was November 2002. You
                        moved on. What sort of work have you been doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I then went to Khartoum in January for 3 weeks or so to do the first
                    photo shoot on a book project that my wife and I and a British photographer,
                    Michael Freeman, and his wife had conceived and sold to both the Sudanese rebels
                    and the government in Khartoum. We came back. I went off to do some
                    consultancies related to a national security strategy planning in NATO PfP
                    (Partner for peace) countries at the George Marshall Center in
                    Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany. I was sitting at home March 12 when I got a
                    call from (Deputy Secretary of Defense) Paul Wolfowitz, who asked me to join the
                    effort that had been stood up in response to President Bush's determination in
                    January (NSPD-24) that there should be an Office of Reconstruction and
                    Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) located in the Pentagon that would concern itself
                    with Iraq after a possible military victory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you accept or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>CARNEY: I said to Paul that of course I would accept, but I would first have to
                    speak with Jay Garner, head of ORHA. I did. I met with Jay on Friday, March 14.
                    In the meantime, my wife let a couple of colleagues know that Wolfowitz had
                    given me a call. One of those colleagues was Robin Raphel, for whom I had worked
                    as her deputy when she was Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs.
                    Robin, then Vice-President at NDU, had been tapped by the State Department, and
                    was with Barbara Bodine in training at Fort Meade. Robin let the Middle East
                    Bureau know that Wolfowitz had called me and I got a call on Thursday, March 13,
                    from Jim Larocca, DAS in the Middle East Bureau, who pretended that I was on the
                    State Department's list, and suggested that I might want to go to Iraq as the
                    Senior Advisor in the Ministry of Industry and Minerals. I told Jim that I was
                    going to see Jay Garner the next day and I wasn't sure what I wanted to do
                    there. He suggested that I let Jay know that the State Department had me in mind
                    for advisor in the Ministry of Industry and Minerals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the background in ministry of minerals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The Ministry of Industry and Minerals in Iraq... basically, we had no
                    current information on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's the oil ministry, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No. I subsequently learned the information was outdated. It was that
                    Ministry that, at least in the pre-first Iraq War period, was responsible for
                    procurement for material for the weapons of mass destruction programs, and at
                    the same time had under its aegis a number of state owned enterprises that ran
                    everything from electricity in Baghdad to the dairy to vegetable oil to the
                    sulfur industry. Oil was itself a separate and large ministry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel? Did you feel right away that this was a
                        tug of war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I knew it was a tug of war because I had called some people whom I knew
                    well and had gotten an initial briefing on the unseemly food fight between State
                    and Defense over Iraq, some of which was in the newspaper by then. I met with
                    Jay. He was the Director of the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian
                    Assistance, a retired Army lieutenant general who had successfully and
                    brilliantly run an operation in the Kurdish areas of Iraq in 1991, Operation
                    Provide Comfort, that responded to humanitarian needs. I sat down with Jay. He
                    was bustling and in a hurry because he was leaving with the people who had been
                    recruited at that point on Sunday, the 16th, for Kuwait, to establish the ORHA
                    offices ready to move into-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The war had not started at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>CARNEY: The war had started March 9. There was a fear that there would be a
                    catastrophic collapse and instant victory, and that the postwar administration
                    would need to be in place urgently. So, Jay was ready to take the team that he
                    had built at that point. That's why Robin Raphel and Barbara Bodine and others
                    were in training at Fort Meade. They needed to know how to get in and out of
                    chemical weapons gear, and how to pull the trigger on a Beretta 92F pistol.</p>
                <p>I spoke with Jay. We talked about it. I let him know that Jim Larocca had me in
                    mind for what. He asked what I had thought. I said I only had a brief chance to
                    look at things, but it occurred to me that his organization might need an
                    ombudsman because there were sure to be major problems dealing with Iraqis. They
                    would have claims and grievances and it might make sense to have a cool,
                    practiced head in a position to help redress them and ensure that the civilian
                    administration would function properly in relation to Iraqis. He said he wasn't
                    sure what he'd want me to do, but for sure I ought to get out there. He
                    introduced me to a fellow who had the capability of organizing contracts and
                    said, “Do what you can to get out as soon as you can.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was very unstructured at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were just a guy who had been around the block.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have any idea about who you were or what you'd
                        been doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Paul Wolfowitz had called him and let him know that I had worked for Paul
                    as his political counselor in Jakarta and that he found me somebody who ought to
                    be on Jay's team. After talking with each other a while, I took Jay's measure
                    and he took mine and we decided mutually and separately that we'd make a good
                    mix to work together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>CARNEY: Monday, the 17th of March, I got hold of the State Department. I had
                    tried to talk to Ruth Whiteside, but she was not available. She was then the
                    deputy director general and deputy head of Personnel at State. Not reaching her,
                    I spoke with a woman named Catherine Austin who offered me a WAE (when actually
                    employed) status to go to Iraq. That was not acceptable. There wasn't enough
                    salary in it. Moreover, I had been working actively as a consultant at that
                    point for more than 2 years. I decided that Ms. Austin didn't have the
                    horsepower to discuss the issue and I needed to speak with Ruth Whiteside. I
                    didn't get a call back from her, so I called the fellow at the Pentagon whom Jay
                    had introduced me to. He organized a contract with SAIC, which is a large
                    contractor that works from government contracts. SAIC signed me up by Friday,
                    March 21st, and I was on a plane the 23rd for Iraq.</p>
                <p>I was on a plane with a group that was going to fulfill the contract SAIC had won
                    to create an indigenous Iraqi media, an effort that has proved to be inadequate
                    at best, anemic, underfunded, poorly staffed, and badly directed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It doesn't sound like you had much time to consult with
                        anyone who was there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I didn't. I got a pretty full briefing on the Future of Iraq project, but
                    had none of their documents. I found it astonishing that the director of that
                    State Department effort, Tom Warrick, had initially been consulted and then was
                    put aside by Pentagon authorities. I had an indication that the Pentagon was
                    very unhappy with Arabists at the State Department who were believed to be
                    unwilling or unable to believe that any Arab - Arabs in general, much less Iraqi
                    Arabs - would have any hope of seeking or achieving democracy for their
                    nations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you went out there, did you feel that you were in an
                        ideological situation where there was a set within the Pentagon that “This
                        is the way it's going to fall out?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, I can't say... I had a clear indication that the Pentagon was in
                    absolute charge, that the State Department was in general churlish, that the
                    Pentagon was being equally or more churlish because they delayed for more than
                    10 days the clearance and approval for travel of a number of people the State
                    Department designated to join Jay Garner's staff, mainly retired ambassadors or
                    active duty former ambassadors such as, in the former category David Dunford,
                    then in retirement in Tucson. Robin Raphel was at that point Vice President of
                    the National Defense University. A number of other people were with them and
                    regarded as hostages to the State-Defense argument over Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You landed in Kuwait when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>CARNEY: The 23rd of March and moved into the Hilton Villas complex which was
                    housing the ORHA crew the 24th of March.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the war at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was being vigorously prosecuted. I cannot remember exactly how far we
                    had gotten but there had been... The previous two days an Exocet had hit the
                    pier in Kuwait itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about the atmosphere and what you were doing and what
                        you were picking up? In a way, you were the new boy on the block.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was frantic. The Hilton Villas complex had a number of villas with the
                    target audience rich Arabs and other Gulf nationals who simply wanted to get
                    away to Kuwait with their families and relax. I was in villa 904 which
                    ultimately grew to have about 8-9 people in it. I had taken the maid's room
                    because it was so small with bunk beds that I figured I would at least have a
                    room of my own. It did have an attached bath. Perfectly comfortable. There was
                    an effort to get military equipment out to people who didn't have it. I didn't
                    go through any training in chemical gear. I was able to get out so quickly with
                    SAIC and it was clear that it wasn't going to be necessary even at that early
                    stage.</p>
                <p>There was an ongoing series of meetings. ORHA was organized in a military fashion
                    to effect a political-military mission. You had the command element, Jay Garner
                    and his deputy and others, a large group of retired mostly lieutenant generals.
                    You had the staff elements as close to them as possible. Then instead of
                    brigades and battalions on the wings, which is the military organization, you
                    had the “pillars” out on the wings. There was a pillar for reconstruction that
                    was run by AID's retired former senior official Louis Lucke. You had a pillar
                    for humanitarian affairs that was run by retired ambassador George Ward, who was
                    at the U.S. Institute of Peace and who had, like me, organized his contract
                    through USIP rather than accepting a WAE status. Then you had the ministerial
                    wing, advisors for all those ministries except those ones of the 23 ministries
                    that would have been involved in reconstruction. That was under a lawyer and
                    former partner of Pentagon (Undersecretary for Defense Policy) Douglas Feith.
                    That chap's name was Mike Mobbs.</p>
                <p>There was a planning effort to go forward to deal with the problems we thought we
                    might have administering Iraq. The focus was very heavily on potential refugee
                    and humanitarian emergencies, especially possible famine following military
                    activities. As we know, neither of those actually materialized. The ministerial
                    group was not well led, and never really gelled as a body partly because many of
                    its heads were held up as hostages in this State-Defense argument.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ministerial group were civilians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, very heavily civilians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: State Department types.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: State and AID and officials from a number of other agencies. There was a
                    Treasury team that would have been at the central bank and the finance ministry,
                    and a Dept of Agriculture fellow for the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any people who ran things, former mayors of
                        cities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There was nothing like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This has always sort of astounded me that we didn't
                        have...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I'm told that Mayor Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, was
                    approached to run the entire operation and he declined. I don't know if that's
                    true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your group didn't...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: We had almost no one who had a background in any of these things. You
                    perhaps read last week's issue of the “New Yorker.” There was a Harvard Ph.D.
                    named Andrew Erdman in his 30s who wound up as the senior advisor in education
                    who did quite a good job. If you read George Packer's article in the “New
                    Yorker” of last week, you'll see that. Erdman, whom I saw at an Iraqi tribute
                    ceremony that the Secretary of State presided over on November 24th, is now on
                    the NSC staff working under Bob Blackwill. There were some serious people from
                    the Department of Agriculture, a very competent officer, the senior advisor for
                    the agriculture ministry. The Ministry of Trade ultimately had Robin Raphel as
                    its senior advisor. She ultimately became Mike Mobbs' replacement when Mobbs
                    left Iraq.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: The partner of Douglas Feith, who proved to be inadequate as head of the
                    ministerial pillar. Walter Slocombe was eventually named Senior Advisor at the
                    Ministry of Defense to which the Ministry of Military Industrialization was
                    joined. He was fundamentally missing in action for the first month of operations
                    due to other commitments. He is the one who is said to have been behind the very
                    bad decision to totally disband the Iraqi army.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's been looked upon as... Jerry Bremer at least made
                        the announcement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Bremer replaced Jay Garner May 12th and made two initial mistakes. One
                    was that. The other was the sweeping deBa'athificaiton effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had anybody brought up.. I was in Germany sometime after
                        the end of World War II. There was the famous document, the “Frageboten.”
                        Almost every German of adult age had to fill out a questionnaire: “What did
                        you do?” Every German of a certain age knows that intimately. Was there any
                        thought of... It was a sorting through who was relatively clean, not
                        completely clean.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: To the extent the occupation of Germany was looked at, it was dismissed
                    because it had had the luxury of years of planning. The administration of Iraq,
                    which in law is indeed an occupation, was moving so fast that nobody had the
                    time once we got on the ground in Baghdad, which took a month, to look at those
                    kinds of lessons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the question of the army and what to do about it and
                        the Ba'ath Party and what to do about it discussed in your group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was only discussed at the senior level. The only one in the
                    ministerial pillar who had anything to say about it was Robin Raphel, who was
                    part of the senior Bremer staff. On deba'athification, Robin sat down with
                    (Foreign Ministry Senior Advisor, retired Ambassador) David Dunford and myself
                    to look at what was going on. One of the midlevel people, a woman named Margaret
                    O'Sullivan, who had been part of the Policy Planning staff at State, tried to
                    get in it, and I basically tossed her out, saying, “This is ambassadors
                    talking.” Very capable, but it wasn't a place to have junior people with little
                    hands-on experience, as the three of us discussed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>CARNEY: About how to save Bremer from himself. The initial discussion on the
                    Ba'ath was so sweeping it would have been totally self-defeating. The effort was
                    to establish exceptions, the grounds for exceptions, and basically to produce
                    something that had a capability of functioning on the one hand, and being
                    acceptable at large, notably to Iraqis, on the other. There was no doubt that
                    Iraqis were unhappy that so many senior Ba'athis continued to be in positions.
                    The initial policy, Washington's policy, a policy that Jay Garner enunciated,
                    and that I enunciated to the Ministry senior staff and to the Director's Manager
                    of the State Owned Enterprises, the 52 under the ministry's aegis... Remember
                    that Iraq is not a Third World country. It's not Afghanistan. It's not Africa.
                    It is a Second World country. It's much more like Eastern Europe or the former
                    Soviet Union. The government owns most of the means of production. Of the
                    roughly 150 state owned enterprises, if that many, 52 with 100,000 employees
                    were under the aegis of the Ministry of Industry and Minerals. The Ministry
                    itself had a staff of only 621. There were 12 Directors General. Then you had
                    Director General equivalent, Director Manager, as head of the state owned
                    enterprise itself.</p>
                <p>The policy at the time was, members of the Ba'ath Party could stay on the job
                    unless they were guilty of gross human rights violations, had been active in
                    production of weapons of mass destruction, or had supported terrorism. That
                    didn't quite hold because some of these people who were senior Ba'ath Party
                    members were objectionable to the employees of the enterprises they led. There
                    were 4 cases by May 4th where I, in consultation with the Ministerial Management
                    Committee that I named after I had a chance to take the measure of the Ministry
                    senior staff, replaced those 4.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It was more personality and style than it was Ba'ath Party membership.
                    They simply alienated their work force, either by being arbitrary, shouting at
                    people or being arrogant. For these four cases, it was an issue of
                    labor-management bad relations.</p>
                <p>When Bremer came in, his first proclamation of May 16 stated, senior members of
                    the Ba'ath Party - there were 4 levels of senior party membership - were all
                    automatically excluded from public life. Full members of the party at a junior
                    level could continue to stay on unless they were senior management of either
                    industries or ministries or government agencies. Those junior full party members
                    who were at such senior management level needed an exception to stay on, as did
                    any senior full party member whom we deemed necessary to continue the job. That
                    was Robin Raphel's contribution to a more rational program.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any of us who served in... I served for 5 years in
                        Yugoslavia. You looked upon membership in the Communist Party or whatever it
                        was at certain levels... You had to be. You paid your contribution and there
                        were communists and there were just people who were members of the party.
                        Even fairly far up, because of their position, they had to. There is a lot
                        of difference in this. Was the Ba'ath Party different than the Communist
                        Party in this regard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The quick answer is, we didn't know. We knew very little about the Ba'ath
                    Party. The only decent description of how the Ba'ath Party was structured that I
                    ever saw was in Phebe Marr's book, Modern History of Iraq. It talked about a
                    number of levels of membership. There was no list of senior members from FBIS,
                    CIA, British intelligence. There was no description of how one was recruited
                    into the Ba'ath Party or advanced within the Ba'ath Party. There was some
                    argument made to Bremer that produced a figure of 30-40,000 Iraqis who would be
                    removed from public life. No indication who it would be.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, senior full party membership was not a function of job. As I
                    discovered when I began to get appeals from employees of the various state-owned
                    enterprises, there were very few senior full party members among the 60
                    Directors Manager and Directors General of the Ministry. There were 6 maximum.
                    Everyone else was either a full party member at the junior level or candidate
                    member of the party. I discovered that to advance from junior party member to
                    senior party member, you actually had to submit your name and stand for an
                    election. There was an electoral process within the ranks of the party itself.
                    That produced the reality of what I called “shop floor firkas.” A firka was the
                    lowest of the 4 senior levels of membership. There were any number of shop floor
                    people who had advanced, tried to advance, to firka because you got extra money
                    if you were at that level.</p>
                <p>Then there was the group that came in to see me, 2 men. They had been prisoners
                    in Iran for 18 years after the Iran-Iraq War, the longest held until 1998 or
                    '99. They were automatically made the lowest senior level of the Ba'ath Party by
                    decree. They had not stood for election. They hadn't gone through party
                    candidacy. I argued by memo to Bremer in late May or early June that we needed
                    to make automatic exceptions for all such cases except where the individual
                    actually stood for election to the next higher level. Then you could argue that
                    a person had bought into Ba'athism. Never got a reply. NOTE: I since learned
                    that Bremer issued an Order excepting these people in December 2003.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's go back a bit. While you were sitting in Kuwait, was there this group
                    that the Defense Department had put together of Iraqi exiles sitting around?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, they had not yet arrived. There were a few of them, but they had not
                    yet arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anybody serving as an advisor on what was happening in

                <p>CARNEY: No.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had all these people who defected or got the hell

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There were some Iraqis who would come through, some people who passed
                    themselves off as tribal leaders, who met with Jay Garner, but basically,
                    no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Jay have a big notebook full of the plans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There was an effort to do a unified mission plan which ultimately
                    produced a very badly drafted document that I have in my computer that was never
                    used.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling of either disorganization or “We're
                        going to have to do this off the top of our heads?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes. Everybody knew it was ad hoc. Everybody knew that we were going to
                    have to get to Baghdad and make do. And the looting started around April 8 or 9
                    when the troops took Baghdad and it dismayed all of us. The ministerial wing had
                    submitted to the Combined Forces Land Component Commander, CFLCC, a list of 24
                    sites that needed to be protected and that document was never acted on. Nor by
                    hindsight was there the will or even the capability to protect the sites that
                    needed to be protected except the Oil Ministry and the Ministry of Military
                    Industrialization that had split off from the Ministry of Industry and Minerals
                    in the mid-'90s and became the locus of Iraqi efforts to clandestinely procure
                    WMD related equipment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, there wasn't a plan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There was no plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Jay Garner doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: He was pep talking. He was regularly at the various meetings to discuss
                    everything from how to vet senior civil servants (never came to a conclusion)
                    how the city of Baghdad was going to be organized and governed (that had a good
                    focus from Barbara Bodine. Her deputy, AID official Ted Morse, also retired, and
                    Australian Lieutenant Colonel Keith Schollum, who was the chief of staff of that
                    effort)...</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>The object was to get to Baghdad and get to grips with the situation. The focus
                    was heavily on the most immediate needs: health, water, sanitation,
                    electricity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Basra? The British were just going to take care
                        of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No. The civilian component had 3 geographic elements as well - one for
                    the north to be centered on Mosul. A general retired was the head of that, one
                    on Jay's staff. The south, also a retired general, was to have its own element
                    as well. The center, which included Baghdad, was under Barbara Bodine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you all feeling the hand of Secretary of Defense
                        Rumsfeld or his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, in this initial phase?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The essential problem was, the civilian mission needed to be out in front
                    and the instructions from the Pentagon were that nobody would say anything to
                    the press. The Pentagon's focus, understandably but inadequately, was on the
                    military effort. Part of the result of that was that the military for the most
                    part had no clue and less interest in what the civilian effort was thinking
                    about or planning to do. There was considerable interface especially between the
                    ORHA staff and the Civil Affairs element of the military. Civil Affairs was part
                    of the J5 or the planning element, and the Civil Affairs Command is an important
                    part of the U.S. Army that draws on reservists, mainly professionals. The plan
                    was that shooters would go in; Civil Affairs would be behind them. Civil affairs
                    would make contact with all the ministries. When the civilians under Jay Garner
                    got there, the Civil Affairs officers would be able to introduce them to the
                    ministerial staffs and we would have a smooth transition into operations, but it
                    didn't work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The ministries were looted and for the most part burned where they had
                    not been bomb or shell damaged. In my case and the case of the British fellow,
                    Simon Elvy, who was the Senior Advisor at the Ministry of Planning, we first
                    toured his building April 26th, 2 days after we got to Baghdad. It was
                    essentially unusable, but was relatively intact except for the looting of
                    anything that could be carried away except anything you could read. The library
                    was still intact. There had been fires at one or 2 places but census records
                    were still there. We went over to my ministry, which had 2 U.S. tanks guarding
                    the complex. The Ministry of Industry and Minerals and the Ministry of Higher
                    Education were in the same complex.</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>I learned from the U.S. lieutenant who was in command of the 2 tank detachment
                    that a fellow in a blue blazer and a shirt and tie appeared every morning about
                    8:00 to see if there was anybody with whom to make contact. I subsequently met
                    him the next day or the day after. That began my contact with the senior staff
                    of the ministry. He was a Ph.D. in metallurgy from Imperial College in London,
                    Dr. Walid. I then met him and the rest of his colleagues that afternoon in a
                    meeting inside the secure zone on the west bank of the Tigris near the
                    Republican Palace, a meeting organized by an Iraqi who had become close to Jay
                    Garner, a fellow named Saad Al-Janabi who had been close to one of Saddam
                    Hussein's sons, but was forced to flee in the 90s. Janabi had the rest of the
                    senior staff of a number of ministries, including mine, present at this
                    facility. Those from Industry and Minerals included Dr. Walid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had happened to the ministry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The ministry had been hit by a bomb or two, and then apparently some
                    arsonists had gone in and tried to burn part of it. It was a very modern high
                    rise building with a lower building attached to it that was severely bomb
                    damaged. There were some out buildings that now served for a weekly meeting of
                    the Deputy Minister and senior staff, the Minister having been one of Saddam
                    Hussein's relatives, and been arrested and was under interrogation at U.S.
                    facilities.</p>
                <p>The Sunday meeting with a number of Directors General and the Deputy Minister
                    resulted in the establishment of my relationship with them. They suggested that
                    the Deputy Minister become the Supervisor. I accepted that and introduced him to
                    the press 4 or 5 days later. He answered questions quite well. But there were
                    second thoughts and it was clear that the Deputy Minister was regarded as far
                    too Ba'athi by his colleagues. I essentially arranged with a number of Directors
                    General to remove him. He and I talked on the appointed day in early May and I
                    told him it was time he moved on from the Ministry... He said, “Why don't we do
                    this by election?” He was confident he would win such an election. This was at
                    the Thursday meeting of ministerial senior staff and state owned enterprise
                    directors. I said, “Yes, let's do it that way.” We opened the meeting by his
                    announcing his resignation, suggesting elections, call for nominations. He
                    nominated himself. One of the directors general nominated a colleague, Director
                    for Planning, Mr. Mohamad Abdel Majid Al'ADin- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>We then retired, the 2 candidates retired, and all of the foreigners retired -
                    myself, Lieutenant Colonel Jackson, the Civil affairs officer working with the
                    Ministry, and the Iraqi-American who had joined my team from the
                    Pentagon-sponsored IRDC group (not to be confused with Ahmed Chalabi's group the
                    INC), Dr. Ramsey Yusef Jiddou. We retired to let the directors general and
                    directors manager debate. They chose Mr. Mohanad by a vote of about 38 to 2. The
                    Deputy Minister said he accepted the vote, and that he would leave. Mr. Mohanad
                    said, “No, we'd like you to stay on as an advisor.” It worked. This was all
                    described in a “Time Magazine” piece in mid-May of 2003.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the group that you were working with, were they ready
                        to get back to work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Absolutely. I knew from the first meeting that I had - it was confirmed
                    in the second meeting - that Iraqis were the ones who could do it. At the second
                    meeting, I was presented with a list of priority industries that needed to be
                    put back on stream as soon as possible to answer the emergency needs. The focus
                    was on the dairy, the vegetable oil factory, and a couple of chemical industries
                    that produced chemicals for water purification, for example, and housing and
                    construction materials to do repairs. These industries needed electricity
                    because they were intact and had inventories and could resume production if they
                    had enough electricity. Very squared away, imaginative, creative, and
                    impatient.</p>
                <p>Let me add here that there was no... I could communicate this but there was
                    nobody who was doing anything with it. The State Department was unhappy with me.
                    I had gone off line in search of my former OMS from Sudan and Haiti and asked if
                    she would come to Baghdad and work with me. She said she would be delighted.
                    Barbara Bodine had communications directly with the State Department. (I would
                    occasionally send a memo to her for information even though I was in bad odor at
                    the State Department.) The reply that indirectly reached me was that the
                    Undersecretary for Political Affairs, Mark Grossman, said that I had taken a
                    Defense Department contract, so there was going to be no State Department
                    secretary to support me. That sort of pettiness, small mindedness, was unworthy
                    of a U.S. effort that had such priority and to this day is so urgent. Remarkable
                    and unsurprising.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Garner lasted how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: He lasted until June 1, but he was replaced when Jerry Bremer arrived May
                    12.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had Garner fizzled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Jay Garner had argued when he took the job that he was only going to be
                    there for 3 or 4 months. That was all he was willing to spare from his business.
                    If he visibly taken hold and succeeded, I think he would have been pressured to
                    stay. But he clearly was not the right man for the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you see the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>CARNEY: It was his unwillingness to be out in front with the media, sharing, on
                    the one hand a vision of what the political-military effort sought to achieve
                    with the international press, but also unable to communicate to Iraqis that same
                    vision. That remains somewhat improved but is a continuing serious
                    deficiency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the Iraqi exile group-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There are a number of Iraqi exile groups. It's very important to
                    distinguish among them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your point of view, did you have any group that you
                        were working with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The only people I was working with were a group known as the IRDC Iraqis.
                    They were based at Crystal City. They were essentially specialists and experts
                    whom the Pentagon wanted to come out and join the ministerial advisory teams.
                    This chap, Ramsey Yusef Jiddou, who holds a Ph.D. and had been on the staff of
                    the Ministry of Industry and Minerals in the Survey State Owned Enterprise, was
                    among them. Many of those people, however, thought they would come out and
                    instantly be the new minister and needed to be disabused when they arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like you inherited a professional corps and that
                        people who had been outside really weren't going to add... The Crystal City
                        people weren't going to particularly add...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: That is broadly correct. However, I found that the Crystal City people,
                    IRDC Iraqis, what they added was knowledge of the players based on their earlier
                    time before they fled Iraq, and in some cases a very good judgment of how to
                    deal with complicated situations. For example, there was an effort by Shia
                    groups to put their hand in control over the Ministry of Industry and Minerals
                    working through some of the state owned enterprises.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about a religious element.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No, it was a political element in the guise of religion. You can't
                    separate them in a place like Iraq.</p>
                <p>Back to Jay Garner, he had no real feel for the media. Worse, he did not have the
                    weight. He was Donald Rumsfeld's man, unlike Bremer, who was a special
                    presidential envoy. Also, he was a retired lieutenant general and he would not
                    tell Rumsfeld where to get off when he needed to.</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>Worse, the structure of command in two ways was totally inadequate to the
                    mission: On the one hand, you had the military structure I described - command
                    element, staff elements wrapped around it, brigades, battalions at the wings. In
                    our case, it was command element, staff elements, all named in military fashion
                    - C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, etc. - and the pillars, reconstruction, humanitarian, and
                    ministerial out at the wings. In the military, that works partly because of the
                    amount of people you have in brigades and battalions but mainly because you have
                    good communications. We had no communications except shanks' mare. You had to
                    walk from your location in one wing of the Republican Palace to find anybody to
                    do anything. We had no telephones, no radios, except Thuraya satellite phones
                    that only work outside in direct line of sight with the satellite unless you had
                    the unavailable docking stations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you all view the looting? Was this spontaneous or
                        was there those behind it, a plan? Why wasn't it more contained either by
                        our troops or by Iraqi forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There were no Iraqi forces. The police had fled. The army had
                    self-demobilized. The looting was and is a stain on the honor of the U.S.
                    military, resulting from incompetent, inadequate military planning and
                    execution. There is no possible justification for it. That stain was set by the
                    absurd remarks of the Secretary of Defense who essentially argued, “Boys will be
                    boys. After a time of oppression and repression, who can be surprised at
                    looting?” The answer is, no one who has ever done any of these missions was
                    surprised that there would be an effort at looting. What was surprising was,
                    there was no effort to contain it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the electric grid system? That was destroyed.
                        Had that been destroyed by bombing or looting...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Some of the grid was down because of bomb damage. Some of the towers were
                    down. Much of the power comes up from the south. Then you began a set of looting
                    to get the metal from the transformers on the one hand, and from the high
                    tension power lines on the other. The grid was old. There was sitting in boxes a
                    Siemens effort of $30 million in new equipment and Siemens engineers had been in
                    Baghdad ready to install it as the war started and of course they fled. The
                    question was, did we let that Siemens contract be executed or did we cancel it
                    and have someone else do it? After some discussion, Jay decided to let Siemens
                    finish its contract because the money had already been paid. A huge need for
                    more power generation. Jerry Bremer said last month that Baghdad city had
                    finally come up to pre-war electric production. He had said that in early June
                    and lied.</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>We had the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in there attached to Baghdad city.
                    Serious Iraqi power engineers working on it. Basically an inadequate effort in
                    terms of money in the first instance and the delivery of equipment and security
                    to ensure that what was replaced was not stolen again. Much of this is a
                    function of an inadequate number of U.S. troops in Iraq. We're not capable of
                    doing security, nor was there any plan to bring a civilian police effort in to
                    on the one the one hand fill in where the Iraqi police force had disappeared,
                    and then the other to train a new Iraqi police force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the feeling that this would all sort itself out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The mission hoped for the best. It operated on the best case solution
                    which was the Iraqi army would melt away, the coalition would seize Baghdad and
                    the rest of the country, the civil service and the police would be more or less
                    intact, the political-military mission of Jay Garner would go in and become the
                    head and direct what remained and within a few months Iraq would be prepared to
                    make a transition and gain the reins of sovereignty back into their own Iraqi
                    hands.</p>
                <p>Q: Had there been the equivalent to announcements saying, “We're coming in, but
                    we expect you to come back to your posts and we're going to restore order except
                    without Saddam and company?”</p>
                <p>CARNEY: There had been such announcements but nobody really knew what was going
                    to happen. Iraqis were so glad Saddam Hussein was gone. Of course, they were
                    dismayed at the looting, especially of hospitals. They were dismayed at the
                    lawlessness. The weather wasn't so bad that the electricity was absolutely
                    critical, but as the coalition failed to perform in providing services, you got
                    where we are now. So much time was lost that the population, which was wary and
                    suspicious of U.S. motives in particular, decided that we were not partners to
                    bring Iraq into the 21st century; we are occupiers, which indeed we are in law;
                    and perhaps we do have our eye on Iraq's oil. There was enough of a population
                    that believed that that when the insurgency finally got itself organized - and
                    it took months - in April, there was a shooting in Falluja but that was the U.S.
                    military overreacting to demonstrations and that area has gone down however
                    since then. But it took the insurgency some months to get to where it could
                    begin to strike. Unfortunately, while I don't think it has much active support
                    among the populace, there is a certain tolerance. There aren't enough people who
                    are willing to support these insurgents because we didn't establish early enough
                    the credibility of our intentions. Very unfortunate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Jerry Bremer came in, was there a feeling of, “Okay,
                        now we'll put this thing together?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>CARNEY: By then there was some doubt that we had the capability to get it
                    together in a sufficiently timely manner. Jerry to his credit brought in as his
                    Chief of Staff (State Department manager) Pat Kennedy, who put in some
                    organization. Jay Garner's own “C” staffs were remarkably incompetent, with a
                    couple of notable exceptions. The communications person, Colonel Conway, was
                    hopelessly incompetent. The personnel office and the finance office basically
                    understood the problem, and did their damnedest to get things organized but they
                    were relatively small. By the time I left, there were more than 1,200 on Jerry
                    Bremer's staff - that was June 16th - and it wasn't enough. Remember, I did the
                    UN mission in Cambodia. There were more than 2,000 civilians in the UNTAC
                    mission and 3,000 civilian police, and 20,000 troops for a chapter 6 Mission in
                    a country one third the size and population of Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the feeling that this was being controlled from the
                        Pentagon, trying to make this as small an outlay as possible? Or was it just
                        that the forces were not even available back in the States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: On the military side there was no doubt it was Rumsfeld's effort to try
                    to keep it as small as possible. On the civilian side, the ORHA side, it was
                    clear there was not enough planning done to decide who would be needed to do
                    what.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I did not. It was clear that Industry and Minerals had had nothing to do
                    with that for at least 10 years.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: Barbara Bodine was in the central pillar and she was on the other wing of
                    the palace. She had gone in early May, and was not part of Robin Raphel's
                    discussions on the deBa'athification structure. It was basically Robin, David

                <p>CARNEY: No, it was very ad hoc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Bremer arrived, he almost immediately announced
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: He arrived May 12 and May 16 put out the proclamation on
                    deBa'athification. I don't recall the date of the proclamation on disbanding the
                    army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was about the same time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this something that had been in the works?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: DeBa'athification was, as I earlier explained... The new policy came with
                    a few days' warning. There were enough days' warning that I had met with the
                    senior staff the previous Thursday and I basically said to them that I could not
                    provide any details on what they all had no doubt heard about, that there was an
                    argument in Washington on the question of deBa'athification. I told the
                    assembled group of 40-50 Iraqis that it was an intensely political matter, that
                    I would follow it and try to get the news to them in as timely a manner as
                    possible but I could not tell them where it was going to come out but it was
                    clearly a serious matter that would require their attention. I believed then, as
                    it turned out wrongly, that all of them were at least junior full party members
                    and many of them more than that.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel that the system of management at least at the ministry where you
                    were working, that Saddam Hussein had had a method of administering on the
                    management side that left its mark or not?</p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes, but it seemed to be very individual, ad hoc. The Director of
                    Planning who became the Supervisor, Mr. Mohanad, was not a Ba'ath Party member
                    at all. He had been Deputy Minister and was removed from that job because he
                    refused to join the Ba'ath Party. Another director at one of the state owned
                    enterprise had run afoul of Saddam Hussein's good friend who was put on the
                    enterprise management committee against his objections. That almost caused this
                    fellow to be fired completely. But he wasn't. Interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find within the ranks of the civil service
                        competent staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>CARNEY: In the Ministry of Industry and Minerals, yes. But that's very much of a
                    technocrat ministry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Let me add that one of the creative solutions to issues from the
                    Ministerial Management Committee was a suggestion to me that all of the heads of
                    state owned enterprises be put to the test of elections and that elections begin
                    with committees on the shop floor who would ultimately produce candidates for
                    the top job. The management committee of a state owned enterprise that had
                    hitherto been heavily appointed by the ministry itself, that those jobs would
                    become open to election from within the enterprise itself as well. We began that
                    process... I checked out with the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) lawyers,
                    with the Judge Advocate Generals staff, and the response was, “Yes, but the
                    coalition has the final authority on who will be permitted to be the director
                    manager.” Bremer's office argued that there were too many frivolous elections
                    around the country. My counter to that was, “This election took place within the
                    context of the law creating state owned enterprises and therefore it was in
                    accordance with Iraqi law and practice.” My argument was accepted.</p>
                <p>That set of elections was very far advanced by the time I left. Three or 4 new
                    Directors Manager had been nominated by the Enterprise Committee that resulted
                    from this process of elections. One of them needed an exception because he was a
                    junior but full party member, not a senior full party member but a full party
                    member. Of course, at the management level, he needed an exception from Bremer
                    himself which I understand much later was granted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within this ministry, who were you in the charts? What
                        role did you play?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I was the ultimate authority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were not an expert in what the ministry was
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: It didn't take me very long to become expert. The Ministry was, on the
                    one hand, effecting procurement for inventories of state owned enterprises and
                    had any number of bank accounts overseas as a result. On the other hand, it was
                    supervising and naming the essential members of state owned enterprise
                    management itself. The challenge was to get a handle on who was who in this
                    process and who could do the job. It didn't take long. It didn't take 3 or 4
                    weeks to figure most of that out.</p>

                    <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that just in the normal course of
                        events that any country anywhere in an enterprise you would find there would
                        be cables or whatever... The Shia mafia, the Sunni group, or what have you,
                        or everybody belonged to a clan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There was some of that, especially the issue of who was Shia and who was
                    Sunni was there. But it was pretty clear and my knowledge was greatly aided by
                    the Iraqi-American, Ramsey Yusef Jiddou, who could help sort my way through some
                    of that. I found in general that the Ministry Iraqi staff was focused on dealing
                    with the problem as much as on dealing with personalities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that they had bank accounts abroad-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: The Ministry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had procurement. At that point we were kind of on the
                        outs with Germany, France, and Russia, who I thought would have been major
                        sources for supplies. Were we being nasty about these contacts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: No. I gave you the example of the case of Siemens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't put on a short leash as far as
                        outsourcing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: There was no procurement going on in the entire period I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that had to be a major thing. Were you cranking up to
                        go out? You'd have to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: We were, yes. I had asked the Ministry to look at the procurement needs.
                    Some things were already in the pipeline and were sitting at ports waiting to be
                    delivered, needing security to move from Amman, for example, across that
                    dangerous road to Baghdad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Bremer group took over, was there a change?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>CARNEY: There was a change for the better and the worse. On the economic side,
                    Peter McPherson, who had been Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and head of AID,
                    came in. He is currently President of Michigan State University. At the same
                    time, a number of Republicans who volunteered to come to Iraq on the economic
                    side came in. A fellow named Rueben Jeffrey. Another named Douglas Combs, the
                    latter having been an assistant to the Secretary of the Navy. All of them
                    generally had a conservative economic agenda, were concerned with the
                    perpetuation of state owned enterprises.</p>
                <p>Peter McPherson proved to be particularly inadequate on the economic policy
                    front, notably in what seemed to be an effort on his behalf in mid-June to
                    cripple state owned enterprises, which in my view was in violation of the
                    fundamental law (Geneva Conventions) under which an occupying power could not
                    either alienate or reduce the value of the assets of the country it was
                    occupying. There is a memo of mine to that effect which circulated broadly in
                    the U.S. and British governments, the last memo I wrote on June 15.</p>
                <p>On the political side, by mid-May, Ryan Crocker, who is now at the National
                    Defense University, then Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Middle Eastern
                    Bureau, NEA, was working to effect a governance structure. Retired Ambassador
                    Hume Horan was part of that. In other words, there were finally some senior
                    Arabists on the scene. Ryan was replaced by Scott Carpenter from the (State
                    Dept.) Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Bureau who has inadequate Middle
                    Eastern experience to credibly replace Ryan. But the ambassador to Kuwait, Dick
                    Jones, has since moved to Baghdad to head that effort both politically and
                    economically. Fortunately, Mr. McPherson is now back at Michigan State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you left in June, were you sensing an urgency
                        about “Things aren't getting together the way they should and we've got to
                        do something?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: You can find a full expression of some of that unhappiness in the piece
                    that I did in the “Outlook” section of the Washington Post of June 22, 2003. Two
                    days later, I was at the Pentagon for a debriefing with Deputy Secretary of
                    Defense Paul Wolfowitz. We sat down for 15-20 minutes and he took notes, just
                    the two of us, as I explained some of the problems as I saw them. Donald
                    Rumsfeld asked John Hamre of CSIS to lead a team out to Iraq to look at the
                    problems at the end of June and CSIS gave an alarming report and recommendations
                    to Rumsfeld that is on the CSIS web site about July 5.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you leave your Ministry?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>CARNEY: We had lunch and they gave me a small product of one of their state owned
                    enterprises, the hand made carpet factory. My deputy, a mid-level Department of
                    Commerce officer, Rick Ortiz, took over, and I was in fact not replaced. I
                    thought the Ministry was sufficiently squared away that any problems were not of
                    lack of organization or determination or imagination in the ministry, but rather
                    of incompetence on the part of the Coalition. I genuinely believed that I was no
                    longer of value added to the effort. That's partly why I didn't ask to extend my
                    3 month contract.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel for where the problem lay at the
                        top?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I reflect on it and think the problem lay with an inability of mainly
                    Americans to bring Iraqis more deeply into our councils, to rely more heavily on
                    Iraqis, and to move in the direction of putting increasing sovereignty back into
                    Iraqi hands. That's where the problem lay. We just wanted to stay in
                    control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that local elections had been part of the
                        process in Iraq for a long time. This was not a new thing. There was an
                        electoral mindset already within the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I'm not sure I grasped that as more than beyond the boundaries of the
                    state owned enterprises.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that this Governing Council that
                        was named was going to go anywhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I wasn't in Iraq when it was named. But I do know that the very name came
                    from the late UN Special Representative of the Secretary General, Sergio Viera
                    De Mello,. Bremer and his people were thinking of calling it a “political
                    council.” Sergio, with whom I worked in Cambodia and with whom I dined in
                    Baghdad before I left-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who tragically was killed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: Yes. He basically had a pretty sensible view as he began to settle in in
                    Baghdad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like you came back pretty discouraged.</hi>

                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>CARNEY: No. In fact, I wasn't because I developed an appreciation of the
                    competence and capabilities of Iraqi and to this day maintain that whatever the
                    absurdities of the Coalition authorities' inadequacies and wishful thinking,
                    Iraqis will actually do the job. They really do have the competence. My caveat
                    is on the security front, where there continues to be a need to capture or kill
                    Saddam Hussein and dishearten his loyalists and those who would operate in his
                    name and to build a competent Iraqi military police and intelligence capability
                    to deal with the Islamists who would use violence as well as the Saddam
                    loyalists.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I do not, but it is in the “Post” archives. The Outlook section.
                    Unfortunately, I discovered I had given my last copy of the actual newspaper
                    away. The archives section is just the text rather than the photos that

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I generally follow it. I had an opportunity to go back to Baghdad as a
                    consultant for some businesses that were interested there, but that has not
                    materialized.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: I don't know. I wouldn't look at it that way. It's too cosmic. I think
                    the best case scenario is an Iraq next year, probably towards the end of the
                    year, which is more stable with a relatively representative government chosen
                    probably through a limited form of election. There will still be Coalition
                    troops there because the security situation will not be totally answered. But
                    most elements of sovereignty, political and economic, except for security and
                    defense, will be in Iraqi hands and decisions made by Iraqis.</p>

                <p>CARNEY: We're in the process of doing so. That's why Bremer was back in
                    Washington. There is a very good story in the “Post” this morning from Rajiv
                    Chandrasekharan which indicates that Grand Ayatollah Sistani put out a fatwa
                    June 28 on the basis of mistaken information in which he declared that a
                    constitution could only be written by elected Iraqis. Bremer and the White House
                    came to terms with that reality when Mr. Bremer came back just a week or 2 ago
                    and then took back the notion that an interim authority with an interim law
                    would be created and from that Iraq would proceed to elections and a national
                    constitution.</p>

                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARNEY: With the Civil Affairs side in particular. Of course, there was plenty of
                    active duty military who were the staff elements of Jay Garner's effort.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you left, there must have been a real feeling

                <p>CARNEY: The military effort that ended April 9 with the end of major hostilities
                    was brilliantly done with 2 exceptions: failure to secure the lines of
                    communication at the outset - and that of course resulted in the contretemps in
                    which (Private) Jessica Lynch found herself - and secondly a bold use of
                    helicopters for assault that came a cropper because they had to fly over
                    enemy-held territory in which many of them took fire that damaged them and
                    reduced their capabilities and effectiveness.</p>
