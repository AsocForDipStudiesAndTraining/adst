                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you go by Doug?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Doug, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start at the beginning: when and where were you
                        born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: 1944, Malden, Massachusetts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the outskirts of Boston; my wife used to live there.
                        Can you tell me something about your family background? Let's start with
                        your father's side first. Where did the Keenes come from; what do you know
                        about them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: He grew up in Medford, Massachusetts; went to school in the Boston
                    suburbs, Boston University and then Tufts, became a teacher and taught at
                    Medford High School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know anything about where the Keenes originally
                        came from or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Not really. My father, who is still alive, claims not to know an awful lot
                    either beyond his parents. They were also from Massachusetts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then your father graduated from Boston University, and
                        then went to Tufts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, he had a masters degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Masters degree in what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>KEENE: Accounting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Accounting! Ah-hah!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: He taught accounting in high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your mother's side. What do you know about her
                        background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: She's a Robinson; also grew up in Medford, Massachusetts. Her father
                    worked for the Customs Service at the Customs House in Boston. And then after he
                    retired from that he was a guide at the Paul Revere House in Boston.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah! How about your mother's education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: She's a college graduate, that was at Lowell State Teacher's College, then
                    she also became a teacher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came from a teaching background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have brothers and sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: One brother...a younger brother, a couple of years younger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you grow up in...not Medford; where did you grow
                        up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Grew up in Reading, MA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Redding, MA. What was Reading like when you were a
                        kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Typical suburb, I guess, about 20,000 population, a pretty nice town.
                    Pretty prosperous really, not that I was so aware of it then.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to grammar school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: In Reading.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Reading, in school there? How did you find
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, they had pretty good schools. I went to a succession of them—grammar
                    school, and then junior high, and then high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All through Reading?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your family, where did they fit...well, in the first
                        place, was it a Catholic, Protestant, what sort of family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: It wasn't terribly diverse—pretty lily white. I don't know what the
                    percentages of Catholic and Protestant were, but there were Catholics and there
                    were Protestants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you Catholic or Protestant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Protestant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Protestant. Politically, did your family fall into any
                        particular...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Very Republican.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very Republican. In Massachusetts...well, I guess they
                        often had Republican governors. I mean...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: There were a few, and we had Senator Brooke, who was a Republican. A
                    liberal Republican, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you much of a reader? What kind of a student were
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, I read a lot. I was a pretty good student, got good grades.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things in books that you read as a kid stuck
                        with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I read a fair amount of history; I liked that from the beginning. Not so
                    much novels, but non-fiction stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you get into the history of Massachusetts at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, we had to study that a little bit in school; I think it was a
                    requirement, and it was a month-long chapter, or something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah, but I was just wondering if you got around and...
                        Did you get into Boston much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, we'd go to Boston. My mother liked to go shopping...dragged us
                    along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you got to high school, how did you find high
                        school? Was it demanding, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Not particularly. I got by without doing a lot of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about sports? Were you into sports?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I played some sports: baseball and hockey. I wasn't that great an athlete,
                    but I enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What courses did you particularly like, and what ones
                        maybe you didn't you like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I liked history, again, not so much math or the sciences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1944. So the memories of World War II. Did your father get
                        involved in World War II?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, he served, and his brother—my uncle—was killed in the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware of world events while you were growing up
                        there much?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. I don't know about in depth, but certainly, yes. I mean the Korean
                    War, and Sputnik—we were aware of them. I used to read the newspaper from a very
                    fairly young age.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What newspaper?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: At that time it was the Boston Globe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your mother and father, would they ever take you off
                        on trips to an island?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, we did some trips, usually to more or less historic places. I
                    remember one to Williamsburg when we were still fairly young, other places like
                    that. And we took a trip—a rather memorable trip—across country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh my.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: About six weeks, back and forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Driving back and forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. Mostly camping.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: In the national parks and things. That was great. I was like 14 and had
                    barely been out of New England.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got into high school, did you get involved in
                        many extracurricular activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: There were some, but I don't remember it being all that heavy...yearbook,
                    senior class play, and a few things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, with both your parents having gone to college,
                        were you on sort of the college track?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Colby College, Waterville, Maine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Colby?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I liked it. I wanted to not live at home. I looked at Tufts, but my
                    parents said, “Well, if you go there, you'll have to live at home...save all
                    that money.” So, we visited several colleges. It was really pretty; it had a new
                    campus. It wasn't so pretty in winter, but I didn't know; we didn't visit it in
                    winter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of those places, eh? I went to Williams and the winter
                        was a little more than what one wanted. What was Colby like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: It was a small liberal arts school. At that time I think they had about
                    1200 students. They were reasonably well-known for their government department,
                    which was what I was interested in. That was another reason I wanted to go
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it co-educational?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, it was. It wasn't “co-educational;” they had a different term for it.
                    Coordinated, or something. But then they changed it while we were there to,
                    formally to co-educational.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there was something called Colby Junior
                        College.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. There still is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that have any relation to...</hi>

                <p>KEENE: Only that it was the recipient of a grant from the same man. That's in New
                    Hampshire, and it's near Dartmouth. I had a girlfriend there, for a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had a girlfriend there, too. Well, what about there; you
                        majored in government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>KEENE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular aspect of government that you
                        were particularly interested in, or wanted to do, or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: International Relations. I already had decided that I would try to get
                    into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that come about? So few people know about the
                        Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I don't know. I had this...I still have it, too, this book, Your Future in
                    the Foreign Service, that I read in high school. I said, “that sounded pretty
                    fascinating; I'd like to try that.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you run into anybody in high school or at Colby who
                        had been in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: No, though a couple of the professors were well aware of it. One fellow
                    studenBob Gelbarlater joined as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself concentrating on any particular
                        aspect, any area...were you studying European or Asian government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: There were courses in European, particularly English, law and history, and
                    I took a seminar on Japan, which was new to me and kind of far out at the time,
                    and that neck of the woods. I took pretty much everything they offered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in college—even in high school—did you end
                        up with summer jobs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, I always had summer jobs. I was a cook.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you cook?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: In Maine.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a camp?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>KEENE: Well, no—it was a beach community, seasonal. It had a lot of seasonal
                    restaurants, and things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: A little place called Ocean Park, Maine, which is really near Old Orchard
                    Beach, a kind of unique place. It was a Chautauqua community...and still is—only
                    about one of eight still in business. But they had a restaurant there. In those
                    days there were still a lot of boarding houses. People would come for the
                    summer, didn't always have a car. There were five or six restaurants there.
                    They're down to one now. I still go there; I ended up buying a cottage. It turns
                    out my wife's family used to go there, so she loved it. And it was great in the
                    Foreign Service, because when the family needed a place to go in the summer, my
                    wife and kids, they'd go there. We had rented out our house down here, so it
                    worked out really well. I bought it when property there was really cheap; I
                    could never afford it now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year did you graduate from Colby?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: '66.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in...were there demonstrations about
                        Vietnam and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: There were, yes. I didn't get much involved. I got married young; we were
                    married when we were 20, so it was a little more important to try to earn a
                    little money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was your wife from? What was her background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Also started out...it's a small world...also born in Malden, Mass. And
                    grew up originally in Medford, but then her family moved to Rhode Island. And
                    then she worked in the same restaurant I did—that's how we met, turned out we
                    were both going to Colby. When we were in our late junior year, we got
                    married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you graduated in '66, were you able to make contact
                        with the Foreign Service at that point, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, I'd already taken the exam, but I hadn't heard back. I took the exam
                    as a senior. That was kind of funny too; they gave it in Bangor, and there was a
                    huge snowstorm that day, and I was the only guy who showed up—out of 35 or so
                    who were supposed to take it. It was good; the examiner got me a cup of coffee.
                    I remember that. I had taken that, but I hadn't heard, so I also took the civil
                    service exam. I got an offer of a job with the IRS (Internal Revenue Service),
                    and I took it. I was an office auditor with them for about six months in
                    Worcester, Massachusetts. Then I got the call from the Department (of State),
                    saying that I had been put on the register and selected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall the oral exam, any of the questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I had to go to Boston for that, and they had set up a table with green
                    felt on it—all very intimidating. Three former ambassadors were on the panel.
                    They asked me a really broad range of questions, from politics to literature. In
                    fact, they asked me about a book that I had just read, and I couldn't remember
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's that awful feeling when you just freeze.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. Absolutely. I can't remember today the title of it, but it was all
                    about Michelangelo and his career. I couldn't remember it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Power and the Glory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Irving Stone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Stone, it was. A pretty broad range of questions. Oh yes—when I was at
                    Colby I did a semester exchange program at Fisk University, in Nashville, a
                    historically black college. And one of the examiners was black, and he seemed to
                    like that a lot. Maybe that helped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came into the Foreign Service when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>KEENE: '67. January '67.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you came down to Washington and took your...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yep.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they talking about when you came in, because
                        this was just the beginning of our buildup in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. That was talked about a lot—Vietnam and Laos, Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, how did that work for you? You were married so this
                        meant you would go or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I was the very first married officer involuntarily sent to Vietnam—one of
                    my claims to fame.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Firstly, how did you find the A-100 course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I found it quite interesting. I learned a lot; I mean, I didn't know how
                    to write cables, or conduct visa interviews, or any of that stuff. And I didn't
                    know the culture of the Department or of Washington, so I thought it was a very,
                    very useful course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your wife feel about coming into the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I think she liked that; she liked the idea of traveling, living overseas.
                    What she didn't like was when I got assigned to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Vietnam from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, at first I took Vietnamese at the Vietnam Training Center in
                    Arlington Towers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the basement. In the garage.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>KEENE: In the garage, right. That was ten months, then I guess they gave us
                    another month of area studies, and so it would be...we went in April of '68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be after Tet (a North Vietnamese offensive
                        waged at the time of the lunar new year)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Just after Tet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Go Cong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: In the delta, Go Cong Province. I was in Saigon for about a month
                    first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the delta from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: This was 1967. We were in CORDS I. CORDS was the acronym for Civil
                    Operations, Revolutionary Development Support. This was later changed to Rural
                    Development. It was part of MAC. MACV/CORDS. First group through. Very
                    interesting. President Johnson had the CORDS I to the White House and then they
                    lined the group up around the President, invited the media in and Johnson gave a
                    little speech, talking about the new CORDS program, calling us “Warriors for
                    Peace.” (Some of the guys from that group are planning a first ever reunion
                    later this year, so that should be fun.) It was 27 months. I got there in April
                    and left two years and three months later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left in July or so of '70. What part of the delta
                        were you in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: It was IV Corps, but it was northern IV Corps. It's a small province. A
                    lot of people haven't heard of it. The biggest close province was My Tho.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know by any chance Howard Gross?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: The name's familiar.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because Howard was down there; I visited him down there.
                        He was in My Tho. I was in Saigon at the time as consul general at the
                        embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In the first place, what was the situation when you were there? It was shortly
                    after the Tet offensive.</p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, yes. Well, there was still plenty of visible damage in the town. I
                    started out working in the province capital as a New Life Development Officer,
                    (which was pacification), but then they eventually had four young FSO's (foreign
                    service officers), including myself, and they decided that we had four
                    districts, and each of us should concentrate on one district. So I did that for
                    a little while in Hoa Tan District, and then when the army major who was
                    district senior advisor, when his tour came to an end, I became district senior
                    advisor, and spent all my time out there for the rest of my tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, I was working with my counterpart, who was the district chief, and
                    we were also doing military operations, we focused on pacification. We built a
                    school and a medical clinic in every village, and we had ten villages in the
                    district, something like 80 hamlets. We electrified one of the villages as a
                    demonstration project, dug wells, paved roads, built markets. We were doing all
                    of this “hearts and mind” stuff; at the same time we had military training teams
                    there and military guys on the district team would go out with the Vietnamese on
                    patrol, ambushes, stuff like that. We also visited local officials in their
                    villages and hamlets on a regular basis to find out what was going on and where
                    the problems were. It was a lot of responsibility for someone 223 years old. You
                    were in charge of your District Team, Mobile Training Teams operating in your
                    district, you could call in air strikes or refuse permission for them and you
                    had $10,000 a month for development projects. It was quite a while in the
                    Foreign Service before I had a comparable degree of responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much fighting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: There was fighting. Not as fierce as up in I Corps, but we lost a few
                    guys. And we'd get mortared, stuff like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were you fighting? Regulars, or...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>KEENE: We had both. We had local VC (Viet Cong), and we had one mainline NVA
                    (North Vietnam Army) division that would come in and out. In a heavily jungled
                    area, they'd come in there and have their R&amp;R (Rest and Recreation) and
                    sometimes they'd attack someone while they were there. It was known as the
                    Coconut Grove and it was on the border with Dinh Tuong, and they'd go back and
                    forth. We had in My Tho area—forget precisely the name of their base—we had the
                    U.S. ninth division, and they would often try to get our permission to conduct
                    operations in Go Cong, and we would never let them, because they were
                    indiscriminate: they'd kill anything that moved. Created more problems than they
                    solved.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the leadership of the
                        Vietnamese, civilian and military, when you were there in your area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I got to know my counterpart and liked him personally, but there was
                    considerable corruption. You could actually tell they were stealing us blind,
                    but you couldn't figure out quite how they were doing it. And I suppose in
                    retrospect it was petty corruption; they'd steal some cement or some rebar, and
                    resell it and stuff like that. We didn't give them the money directly; we spent
                    that ourselves. The Corps gave each district $10,000 a month of AIK funds
                    (Assistance in Kind)—recycled local currency, Vietnamese currency, which after a
                    while you had to have a shoebox to carry $100.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Corp's operation, the direction from
                        Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I did think it was pretty good. I met with William Colby a few times, who
                    was the head of it at that time, but more often we'd deal with the Corps guys.
                    For a while that was John Paul Vann, and then Colonel William Wilson—Coal Bin
                    Willie, as he was known. He was given to inspecting things down to that level of
                    detail. Vann was an impressive guy; Wilson was not so much. Our local province
                    senior advisor was a retired colonel who wasn't really all that impressive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Vann always pushing to get things done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: He was a pretty dynamic guy. My little district—we did okay, probably
                    because we weren't very high up on the radar screen of the North Vietnamese, so
                    they were generally satisfied when they came up to inspect there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was sort of a “live and let live” situation between the
                        local populace and the Viet Cong?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>KEENE: There was certainly a large element of that. There were clashes every now
                    and then, or our PRU (Provincial Reconnaissance Unit) would go out and capture
                    somebody, but it wasn't high level. Lob mortars in every now and then. We'd do H
                    and I—harassment and interdiction—fire every night. You knew it was a war zone,
                    but if you weren't stupid about it you could get around and go to hamlets and
                    villages and talk to people and do projects.</p>

                        old hands.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, I guess so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the war? Did you feel we were
                        making progress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Actually, yes, on a local level. I wasn't so sure about the national
                    level. I remember thinking, for example, that the invasion of Cambodia was a
                    huge mistake... things like that. But you wondered about how they went about
                    trying to fight the war; I thought a lot of that was really misguided. But
                    locally we did okay; I thought we were trying to do the right thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1970. How did you feel? Whither South
                        Vietnam from your perspective at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I guess I thought it was a toss-up. I wasn't quite sure which way it would
                    go, but it was certainly no sure thing that we were going to win. We never
                    understood what we were doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of your colleagues you dealt with there—the
                        corps people? Were they sort of with the program or were you all a bit
                        bemused, or how would you describe it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, I don't know. I dealt more often with the people on my district team
                    than I did with...We'd go in once a week into the capital and go talk to the
                    people in charge there and say “This is what we need. Can you give us some
                    resources?” And that was okay; they were fairly responsive. The place was awash
                    in money, so if you needed some extra cement or rebar, or whatever, you could
                    usually get it. We had a couple of sergeants with us, they knew how to get
                    anything. You wanted a jeep? They'd go get it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In my era we used to call them “midnight
                        requisitions”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: They did a lot of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The sergeants are of course the people who run the army
                        anyway. Who were the people you were dealing with in these villages? Pretty
                        much peasants?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: These were peasants, but some were elected or appointed as village chief
                    or hamlet chief. Usually we'd talk to them. Sometimes it would be, after we got
                    that up and going, the People's Self Defense Force chief. Then there were
                    district officials: they had a health chief, and an education chief, sometimes
                    military, sometimes civilian. We also did a lot with the RD (Revolutionary
                    Development) Cadre. The district cadre chief was a dynamic, resourceful guy, who
                    really had a good feel for what was going on in the area.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, we were. Teachers. The medical people weren't doctors, mostly; there
                    were a couple of doctors around, but they were, you know, technicians. That's
                    basically what we had to offer, too; we had medics who would help them set up,
                    try to teach them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, where was your wife? Did she locate in Bangkok,

                <p>KEENE: She went to Taipei.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Taipei. How did she find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: She liked it very much. They had a group of people in the same situation,
                    and they were in pretty nice housing. It was formerly AID (Agency for
                    International Development) housing—AID had begun to phase out of Taipei, and
                    they took that over. It wasn't a bad life. She studied Chinese scroll painting,
                    Chinese, Chinese cooking, and God knows what else.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I got assigned to Warsaw, but first a year—10 months—of language, so I
                    came back here for Polish language training.</p>
                <p>

                <p>KEENE: Yes, but eventually.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You take well to languages, you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I had a middling MLAT (Modern Language Aptitude Test) score but I could
                    learn them; sometimes the beginning it was a little rough, but after a while it
                    came. Later I dabbled in all sorts of things—Urdu, Arabic...</p>
                <p>

                <p>KEENE: Warsaw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Warsaw. What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Vice-consul: visas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were in Poland from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Two years—'71-'73. Walter Stoessel was the ambassador. He was very
                    accessible, we played paddle tennis with him. Excellent, knowledgeable
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the consular section like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Very busy—pretty big, considering it was a Communist country. Everybody
                    had a cousin in Chicago. Very high refusal rate. Congressmen—some congressmen
                    didn't like that. The Department failed to back us up and we just crumbled. But
                    in '73 after the Paris Accords were signed with the Vietnamese, they sent me
                    back to Saigon on a TDY (temporary duty) to monitor the cease-fire. They sent 44
                    of us, I think there were, back, and I think I got that honor because I was the
                    only officer they had who spoke Polish and Vietnamese, and the Poles were on the
                    ICCS (International Commission on Control and Supervision). And so they set us
                    up—me and the other guy who spoke Polish (but not Vietnamese), in I think what
                    was the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) safe house down by the Saigon River—it
                    was great. We were supposed to have the Poles over you know and entertain them
                    and subvert them.</p>

                <p>KEENE: Saigon.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were sort of your feelings as you went out there
                        about the peace accord?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: We worked in the embassy that time, and they set up something called
                    provincial reporting in that time. We were all given a corps to follow, and
                    every day—and you know they set up those consulates in all the corps. They were
                    reporting, and we were supposed to—four of us—put together a daily report, and
                    then do some longer term think tank things. So, they gave me I Corps, probably
                    because I had never been there before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the one to the north.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, so I went up, traveled and visited several times...trying to figure
                    out what was going on. That's what we were supposed to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: That was just three months. I guess January through March.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was much happening at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: No. There was a momentary lull. Our troops were leaving, and it was a
                    little surreal. Under the accord, the North Vietnamese were allowed to set up
                    offices or little compounds in the South, in the provincial capitals. You'd walk
                    around Da Nang and see this guy with a red star on his helmet—it was kind of
                    weird. There was a little lull in fighting then, and it's when the POW's
                    (prisoners of war) were released during that period. We were on tap to help out
                    with that, though it didn't prove necessary. And some South Vietnamese prisoners
                    were released. I remember I was up in Hue at the time and saw the truckloads of
                    POW's drive past as they came out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for how the South Vietnamese
                        government viewed this development?</hi>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>KEENE: Not well. They thought they were being kind of abandoned...or at least a
                    step toward that, which is how it turned out. I don't know, within the embassy
                    you could get every view possible, from the “it's hopeless,” to people who still
                    believed with great fervor. There were some people who stayed there forever.
                    They really got into it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any desire to hang on there, or was this just
                        something to get through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I always liked Vietnam, when they weren't shooting at you. But it always
                    meant separation, and that was a problem.</p>

                <p>KEENE: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: No, I didn't. It seemed to be more for domestic political reasons than a
                    good, solid agreement to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back in Warsaw...during the time—this would be '71 to

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, it wasn't the worst, but it was still very much a pro-Soviet,
                    communist government, and they were still putting bugs in the embassy, and in
                    our houses, and following us around. I don't think you can at all say close, but
                    it was proper.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The visa cases: Were Poles able to easily get passports to

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: If they were just regular old working-class, or farmers, peasants,
                    whatever... they could. If you were more highly educated you might have more
                    difficulty...or if you got in somebody's bad graces, you might have a much
                    harder time. The guy with the foreign exchange...all those people. Well, you
                    know, they went over there and they worked and they sent the money back, and it
                    was a significant amount...I forget how much.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: They'd come back after they qualified for social security. Really. We
                    passed out thousands of checks every month. That's why we had such a high
                    refusal rate; it just doesn't make any common sense that poor farmers wanted to
                    see Disney Land. These people were not going to be tourists; they were going to
                    work.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. We had Polish-American congressmen; we had congressmen from Chicago
                    whose constituents were upset...that so many of their relatives were being
                    refused a visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, if you refused, what would usually happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: We'd get a lot of congressional letters. It didn't usually make any
                    difference to us, but it made some difference to somebody, somewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you often end up issuing a visa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: No. Not at first. Not until we had instructions to the contrary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where would the instructions come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I'm not sure. I think from the Department, but...probably from the
                    Consular Bureau, but I'm not sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been a little discouraging.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: It was. I agree. And we had a lot of CODELs (congressional delegations)
                    actually. I remember being a control officer for one, and he was
                    Polish-American. He was friendly enough to me, but then he went back and wrote a
                    letter to the Department saying “I hear that this fellow Keene is selling
                    visas.” So I got investigated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did he base his complaint on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>KEENE: Well, he wanted to have, hire a maid, and when we found out about it, we
                    failed to issue the visa. We even had letters he'd written to her in bad Polish,
                    saying “don't tell the consul.” I think he wanted revenge. He was a piece of
                    work, anyway. He later actually went to jail for selling special visa
                    legislation for cash. Gene Boster, the DCM, backed up on that one, earning the
                    sobriquet of “clean Gene”. I should add that there was an especially close group
                    of mostly younger officers then. More than any other post I ever served at we
                    stayed in touch. I still feel close to many of them. We have held several get
                    togethers over the years. We had a 35th reunion a couple of years ago that was
                    very well attended, including Mary Ann Stoessel and Gene Boster.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. I was supposed to move into the political section for the third year,
                    and I actually edited the morning—we did a morning publication with the British
                    Embassy of highlights of the Polish press, and I was doing that. But I got a
                    promotion, and the promotion was on condition that I stay in the consular cone.
                    So I asked around—the DCM (deputy chief of mission) and others—and got advice.
                    They said, “take the promotion while you can.” So I did. So I decided I wouldn't
                    be there a third year doing visas, so I left after two years.</p>

                <p>KEENE: Oh yes.</p>

                <p>KEENE: Arrests, and missing persons, and one—I remember that one—one lady visited
                    and she brought her aged mother who had Alzheimer's, and she wandered out of the
                    hotel. We were looking all over Warsaw for her and the Poles were helpful. They
                    put out radio bulletins. She was found dead and the lady tried to lay the blame
                    on us for her own negligence. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any presidential visits?KEENE: Yes, one
                        presidential visit. That was Nixon. That just involved an incredible amount
                        of work. Eight hundred people came with him. We had Kissinger, Scowcroft,
                        Erlichman, and Haldeman, the whole cabinet.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What piece of the operation did you get?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I had housing...for 800; I think that was actually more rooms than existed
                    in Warsaw at the time, so the Poles let us use a couple of palaces, too. And I
                    was also Haldeman's control officer. That was kind of interesting—but a lot of
                    work. The advance teams and arrogant, pushy, political appointees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess there was also, in a place like Poland, which is a
                        rich vote community in the United States, you had all sorts of
                        Polish-American politicians hanging on, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, a lot of that. They just brought a lot of people, and a lot of press,
                    and it was the kind of place where “we don't like the local toilet paper,” so
                    we'll import toilet paper, and we'll import water, and just all kinds of stuff
                    that went on at the taxpayer's expense. Somehow we got through that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, we were bugged, and we were followed, but they didn't personally
                    harass us, no. In fact, if you got lost, you could stop and say “tell me, how do
                    I get to Gdansk?” and they'd tell you, so it could be useful.</p>

                <p>KEENE: And they did that, particularly when you were new, and I think after they
                    figured out that you were on the up and up, it decreased, you could tell.</p>

                <p>KEENE: Yes, but it was hard, because everybody knew that if you got too close,
                    that person was going to be pulled in for questioning, shown photos of
                    themselves sitting in your living room, they had recordings...So people were

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, for a while I did. I had studied Russian in college and wanted to
                    serve in Moscow, but it never happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you left Poland when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: In '73.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '73. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Karachi, Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're moving around! You were in Karachi from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: '73 to '75.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Karachi like at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Really a horrible place. It was overcrowded, filthy, dirty,
                    chaotic—traffic was unbelievable. And there was very little of historic
                    interest, because before the partition itwas just a backwards fishing village
                    and never had any real history to it. It just grew up really, really fast after
                    partition. So, the interesting parts in Pakistan were elsewhere, like Lahore,
                    Peshawar, and the hill stations. I was a consul, and we had huge numbers of visa
                    applicants there, most of whom if you gave them a visa, they would never be seen
                    again—the same situation. Not fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Gordon Tiger.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: They were pretty good then. That was the Bhutto era (I issued Benazir's
                    visa to study at Radcliffe), so he was elected; it wasn't the military
                    government that you saw so much of, and things were pretty close.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the China connection already opened at that

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, it had. They were up there building roads and providing military
                    equipment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, Karachi today, of course, is a very dangerous place.
                        But there wasn't a fundamentalist problem at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: No. I mean, you could see the pretty good educational system they
                    inherited from the British was starting to crumble, and the birth rate was
                    extremely high. You could see that they didn't have a great future. But no, we
                    didn't have too much of that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Not high. I'm trying to remember now, my dates. One had occurred not too
                    far in the past.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess that the one that occurred then was the one
                        between—over the independence of Bangladesh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was around '72 or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: That was actually just as I was leaving Warsaw, so that would have been
                    maybe '71. Again, there was a lot of fall out from that, a lot of talk about
                    that...but</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the visa side, was it mainly sitting there and saying
                        “no, no, no”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Pretty much. And that's not popular. My consul general didn't like it too
                    much; he was getting phone calls all the time about interceding in visa
                    cases.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Pakistani staff there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: The consular section staff had been there a long time, and they were
                    pretty professional—certainly experienced. The culture of corruption was very
                    pervasive, though, in Pakistan, so you never were quite sure and you had to keep
                    very alert to what they were up to. They could be really good, but some of the
                    other consulate staff that had been there awhile were good, too. Pakistanis can
                    be arrogant, but some of them can be quite competent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were doing this, were there any spots in the United
                        States that had particular Pakistani immigrant communities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. Let's see if I can remember: they were California, and maybe around
                    this area. But I don't know—there was a colony in the DC (District of Columbia)
                    area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with Pakistanis socially?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Quite a bit, quite a bit. We had some friends and then there was a fairly
                    active official representational routine there. We had some nice housing because
                    the embassy had been there, moved up to Islamabad, but had kept the houses, so
                    we had places that were big enough to entertain in. The consul general had a
                    mansion!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get up to Islamabad much, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, a fair amount. We'd hold our own little in-country consular
                    conferences every six months or so at the posts. We had four posts there.
                    Besides Karachi and Islamabad, we had Lahore and Peshawar. Peshawar then was a
                    one-man post, but they did do visas. And we went up a couple of times as
                    tourists; we flew up to Islamabad. A friend of mine in the embassy there loaned
                    me his car, and we drove up to Afghanistan—up into the mountains, you know—Swat,
                    and...I don't even remember all the—the Murray Hills, old British hill station.
                    And we tried to get around Lahore, which was a particular interesting place—a
                    lot of historical buildings there.</p>

                <p>KEENE: No. And they weren't all hostile, either. I mean, they're the same people,
                    just Hindus versus Muslims. So actually a lot of people still had relatives in
                    India, and this, that and the other thing, and they weren't averse to visiting
                    when they could. There were periods when you could and periods when you
                    couldn't. And we took a trip to Delhi, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm trying to think. Was much happening up in Afghanistan
                        at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: No. That was pre-Soviet invasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was '78...'79.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: No, we were able to go up, cross the border, drive around, go up to
                    Bamiyan and see those statues that the Taliban later destroyed. Our kids had
                    blond hair, though, and when they'd see that, the villagers would throw rocks at
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. So we bought them turbans. Put the turbans on them and the problem
                    went away. It was pretty primitive; you can see why they have the problems that
                    they have. It was like going back a couple of centuries. Beautiful—it's a
                    beautiful country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, it must have been about time for you to go back
                        to Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Oh yes, it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They always catch you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: They catch you, no matter how hard you try. Yes, in '75 we came back, and
                    I went to work for PM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Political-Military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>KEENE: I was in an office called Security Assistance and Sales, and it was
                    basically what it said—arms sales and military assistance and military training
                    assistance. I got the Middle East as my portfolio to start.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Almost everything we had in the Middle East was already
                        pledged, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, it was massive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was huge going to Egypt and particularly to Israel,
                        wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, at that time Egypt was in our sights, but we hadn't really started
                    yet until after Camp David (site of peace talks and agreement).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: The biggest program in '75 was Iran—the Shah, followed by Saudi Arabia,
                    and Israel, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Iran was later—our vast investment in promoting military
                        sales and having Bell helicopter in other places working in Iran, we had
                        such a huge American presence, that this is considered to be one of the
                        causes of the sort of Islamic fundamental revolt, and there was, as I
                        recall, quite a bit of concern of people saying, “What are we doing sending
                        all of this stuff to Iran?” I mean, were you feeling that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, definitely. There was a concern. There was an awful lot of money
                    involved, so a lot of company pressures on the one hand. The Pentagon had some
                    concerns of their own, but they also liked to sell that stuff because it kept
                    their costs down. Congress was playing a bigger and bigger role; they were
                    worried about it. It was a major issue at the time. Lots of decision memos went
                    up to the secretary and beyond. Actually, in the office at that time, there was
                    so much going to Iran, that there were two other guys working on parts of the
                    Middle East—one did nothing but Iran. But as these guys' tours came to an end, I
                    got their portfolios too. I eventually, after about six months or so, had it
                    all. It was a very busy job; I liked it. It involved a lot of interagency
                    stuff—contact with DOD (Department of Defense), NSC (National Security
                    Council).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you put the role of PM in all of this pressure,
                        and all that? Were we a brake, a facilitator? Was the Department of Defense,
                        pushing hard?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>KEENE: Well, we tried to play the honest broker role. If we felt it was helpful
                    and notdestabilizing, we might attempt to facilitate it, but there were a lot of
                    times when we did raise serious concerns about the balance of power and effect
                    of the American presence, whatever the issue-inappropriateness of the weapons
                    system. We had several fights like that, because Kissinger would bargain away
                    anything for a little diplomatic advantage. I remember he tried to sell Pershing
                    missiles to Israel, for example. Also, fuel-air explosives; that was another
                    controversial one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the AWACS (Airborne Warning and
                        Control System)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. Sure did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I interviewed Senator Percy, who shot down in flames over
                        AWACS. What were you doing with AWACS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, it was a major weapons sales, so the office was involved in it
                    intimately from the beginning—as with that whole Middle East aircraft package,
                    which was also very controversial: F-15s to Saudi Arabia, which came at a
                    slightly different time. We tended to think AWACS to Saudi Arabia was all right,
                    that in their hands, it would be more of a command and control system than any
                    real threat to—it's all about the threat to Israel. That's what all this stuff
                    is always about. So maybe we didn't care as passionately as some of the regional
                    bureaus did; they were more affected by “clientitis” as they were and tried to
                    be more objective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of PM at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, I went through a couple of them: George Vest and Leslie Gelb and
                    then Reggie Bartholomew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Jordan a factor at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, there was a big controversial sale of I-Hawk anti-aircraft missiles,
                    which just attracted unfavorable views in congress, and they finally
                    compromised. The I-Hawk is inherently mobile, but they made the Jordanians
                    emplace them in a fixed position. That's how that one was resolved. And the
                    Jordanians wanted aircraft, too, but we didn't want to face that battle on the
                    hill (Capitol Hill, i.e. congress).</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a relationship with the manufacturers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, the office also reviewed commercial applications for export of
                    international traffic of arms regulations; and so we would review all of their
                    applications and make our recommendations back to the office of munitions
                    control, which actually issued the licenses, or refused, whatever the case may
                    be. So the guys from the companies would come in and state their case,
                    frequently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been a high pressure job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEEN: Yes, it was. There was a lot of those “secretary's got to have the memo
                    tonight” sort of things. Staying late and working into the night. But I found
                    the work very interesting, so it wasn't that burdensome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feeling that the Israeli lobby was sort of
                        monitoring everything that was doing, and ready to veto.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Oh yes. They were very effective—very well organized and very well
                    informed, and just very effective. They had a lot of influence, particular on
                    Capitol Hill, so it's always a factor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Libya?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, I think nothing at the time was going to Libya. That was, I think,
                    after they'd kicked us out of the—what was it, ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As far as I know—I haven't been following this for awhile,
                        but it seems like there are something like twenty C-130s or something that
                        have been sitting on the ground waiting to go to Libya for about 30
                        years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I think that's true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hope we've pushed them off on somebody else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: They are probably obsolescent by now. I think they were C-130As, and we're
                    up to J or K by now. Yes, I remember that, now that you mention it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the Egyptians weren't getting anything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Not at that time. They had started to throw the Soviets out, and I think
                    we did start a small IMET military training program (International Military
                    Education and Training); but they weren't getting any hardware.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you sort of—your office, acting between, well some of
                        the geographic—well, the Near Eastern bureau—were they pushing to get stuff
                        in or pushing to get stuff off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Mostly to get it in. On the other hand, you have ACDA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, saying no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Saying “no” a lot and. And they had fairly recently set up the office of
                    undersecretary for security assistance so he got involved, and his office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: It wasn't the original one who was named Tarr, hence the T symbol for this
                    office. The one I worked with the most was Lucy Wilson Benson, a Carter
                    political appointee. But there was another one in there, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was she coming down most of the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, she was not real well informed, but well intentioned and could be
                    educated. And after a while she got more and more liberal—that is, liberal in
                    her view that more and more of these sales seem to get to be acceptable to her
                    than when she began. I'm trying to think of the other one.</p>
                <p>I also want to mention our involvement in the North YemeSouth Yemen civil war. We
                    were very involved in formulating the weapons transfers that took place,
                    briefing the President on where we were and coordinating weapons sales and
                    military flights of materials to Yemen. This conflict is not well remembered but
                    at the time it was seen as important in the Cold War context. Aden being a
                    Soviet client state and the North as our ally. We put in a staggering amount of
                    effort into that.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Things had been developing at a rapid pace for two or three weeks before the 7th
                    floor took much notice and Under Secretary Newsom called a meeting. Informed we
                    had already sent TOW anti-armor missiles to Yemen, he wanted to know who had
                    approved that. I had to say I had. I was an FSO-3 at the time. I thought I'd be
                    in deep soup, but he let it go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: '80.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were there during the Camp David business; that
                        must have sort of opened up the gates.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: It did, and we sent a mission to Egypt. I went on it, and developed with
                    them a list of what we thought we could get away with at the time. We went
                    during Ramadan, and it was finalized over an Iftar dinner, and it became known
                    as the Iftar list, and it was the start of a really big supply of military
                    equipment to Egypt and a switch away from the Soviet Union. Of course, we had to
                    pay for most of it; they didn't have any money. Of course we also started a
                    large AID program with them which continues to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When we sell a country a system like the F-16 or
                        something, it's a huge operation—just not the plans, but it's the
                        warehousing...if nothing else, the accounting. It's no longer somebody that
                        sits and reaches into a bin a pulls out a part; I mean, it's all
                        computerized.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, it is. Well, one of the mistakes we made, I think, it the first thing
                    we sold them was an F-4, which turns out to be an incredibly difficult airplane
                    to maintain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is? I didn't realize that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, I didn't either.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The F-4 is the phantom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: And before we got to the 16s, that was the first one we sent them. Boy, a
                    big maintenance facility had to be set up, and a lot of technicians had to go
                    out there and train them. It turned out to be a very difficult undertaking.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in '80, where did you go? You didn't belong to
                        anybody.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: No, I didn't. I went to Cairo—the first pol-mil (political-military)
                    officer in the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, in many ways that put you into something you
                        knew something about by this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. And they were gearing up, and there was a large and growing American
                    presence under the auspices of the Office of Military Cooperation, led by a
                    two-star Air Force general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador when you went out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Roy Atherton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I had to make it up. I started going to the OMC meetings every morning and
                    getting to know those guys pretty well and started talking to them about
                    political factors that needs to be considered and this and that and the other
                    thing. I think pretty soon I because sort of the liaison from the ambassador to
                    the military there. And besides the OMC, we had a fairly large defense attach�
                    office, and we had a naval-medical research unit (NAMRU), and pretty soon we had
                    unacknowledged bases in the desert—a pretty big program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Egyptian military and
                        their ability to absorb this quantify of sophisticated equipment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, they had a problem. Some of the leadership was very impressive,
                    actually—well, trained, Sandhurst (British military school). We started training
                    them in our command schools. But the rank and file was another story; it tended
                    to be maybe illiterates from the farm. There were problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember reading an article by an American military man
                        who was saying there was a real disconnect between our training procedure
                        and you might say the Egyptian, but oh! The Arab one where for the Arab,
                        knowledge is power. And so if you trained a captain on something, he wasn't
                        going to pass much down to his men, where as in our business you pass it
                        down, you get it down to the sergeants and corporals very quickly, and there
                        wasn't much of that. This is how the captain maintains power within the
                        system. Did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. It was very hierarchical, it really was. They had generals doing
                    stuff that we'd have sergeants doing...made for a lot of generals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that in a way your problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, a little, but not so much. It was more the problem of the guys
                    training them, the hands-on technicians, the aircraft mechanics. They had to
                    deal with that at a much more intense pace than we did; I mean, we obviously
                    wanted the program to succeed. Then we started joint exercises with them, and we
                    just had a lot of activity—lot of stuff going on. Other issues: we were tying to
                    get our nuclear-powered warships through the Suez Canal; that one dragged on for
                    years and years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the situation? Did we put them
                        through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: When I was there, they let us do one, once.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which warship was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I forget. As a symbolic thing. But at the time I left, they were still
                    fighting it. I think a few go through now. It really was a major military
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the feeling that this is a major military relationship
                        to build up the military, was this just a pay-off to keep the Egyptians from
                        doing anything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, basically. Well, I suppose a little more complex than that. They are
                    a leader of both the Arab world and in some respects the African Union, and they
                    play a regional role bigger than many of the other countries. And they've done
                    some peacekeeping, so they can use some of that stuff in that way. But what you
                    say is also true—buying them off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any visits or connections with the Israeli
                        side of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Not so much. We had the MFO in the Sinai—Multinational Force and
                    Observers—and we had—the Israeli Embassy opened while I was there, so we could
                    interact a little bit with them, and Israeli officials started visiting. There
                    wasn't a flood of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much connection with the Egyptians, per
                        se?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Oh yes, quite a bit. You had your official relations, where you'd go over
                    to the foreign ministry or the ministry of defense, and I would be doing that
                    almost every day. We had people in the office of the minister; we had people
                    that we knew in the office of—I guess his title was National Security
                    Advisor—Osama Al-Baz, he was sort of Mubarak's right hand man on current issues.
                    Yes, quite a bit. And then we just had some social friends. Some of them later
                    got arrested, and became prominent!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were doing that, were you going to be a
                        political-military officer and had moved out of the consular cone, did you
                        think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, at some point I did succeed in moving into the political cone; I
                    think it was while I was in PM in Washington—'78, or something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, what were they going to do with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, I didn't know, but I liked political-military work and I would have
                    been happy to continue doing it. And in some ways I did, without the title.
                    Later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: . Could you talk about the assassination of Anwar Sadat?
                        Where you were at the time and how that devolved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. I was in the stands at the military parade on October 10, and that
                    was the first year that significant amounts of American military equipment were
                    provided. I was the political-military officer, so it seemed like a good idea to
                    go to the parade. So we witnessed the attack and the assassination. My wife and
                    son were with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had there been any warning of this before—I mean in the
                        embassy did you know there was a basic problem with, I guess they were
                        fundamentalists, or Islamists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: We knew that there was a significant amount of corruption in the Sadat
                    regime, and we knew that he wasn't as popular in Egypt as he was in the west;
                    and we did know that there were the beginnings, we thought, of the growth of
                    fundamentalism. A lot of it in some of the provincial towns, like Asyut, for
                    example, which was quite a poor city, and probably knew less about it in Cairo
                    itself than we later came to discover.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How far were you away from the action?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Not that far.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think when all of a sudden these guys started
                        piling out of trucks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: It was not the first time that a vehicle had pulled over in that parade;
                    they never did preventive maintenance at all in Egypt, so we didn't too much of
                    it at first, except that maybe the truck was broken down. Also, at that instant,
                    they had a flyover by some Mirage jets, so most people were looking up in the
                    sky instead of at the truck. And then of course you heard the sounds of the
                    firing. They threw some grenades too—there was a fair amount of noise. They
                    sprayed the crowd as well as the front row of dignitaries, I guess to keep
                    people down. In spite of all the security that was there, I only saw one guy
                    firing back. They pretty much hit every other person in the front row. I know
                    the chief of staff of the army was hit in the face with a grenade that didn't go
                    off, so he was a fortunate survivor. Mubarak pretty much escaped—he just had a
                    little nick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he next to Sadat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: He was. It was really like every guy. I don't know how they managed to do
                    that—maybe just the way that the rifles fired. Sadat himself was hit, according
                    to some reports later, forty odd times. No question he was dead; I saw what
                    turned out to be his body being removed and taken out of there in an ambulance.
                    And then the embassy called several of us in, trying to figure out how to deal
                    with this situation, and while we were there the ambassador, Roy Atherton, got a
                    call from the Minister of Defense, Abu Gazallah, who just lied to him...just
                    said that Sadat was okay and would survive. I had seen him carried out and
                    didn't believe that at all and soon the truth came out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I remember that report. I was at the State
                        Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: That was pretty—the thing is, he was right next to him, too. He knew much
                    better than that. It was purposeful deception, I'm sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, what did you all do? I mean, how did the
                        embassy respond; what was sort of the immediate thinking about what does
                        this mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>KEENE: Well, exactly. Of course we weren't sure how deep-seated a conspiracy this
                    was. But the streets were fairly calm. People weren't all that saddened. No
                    widespread disturbances broke out; there were a few minor incidents in some of
                    the provincial towns. We knew the constitution; we knew that if there was no
                    uprising or anything further that Mubarak would become president, as he did. We
                    ordered all the appropriate security measures of course—stay home, don't go out
                    in the streets. I guess we closed embassy operations for a few days; I don't
                    remember precisely how long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a sort of re-looking at the file on Mubarak at
                        the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, because he wasn't really that highly regarded as a—he'd been head of
                    the air force, but—and he sat in on a lot of meetings with Sadat, but more...I
                    mean, he never expressed independent ideas or thoughts. He just sort of went
                    along with whatever Sadat said, at least publicly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way that was sort of how Sadat was seen, wasn't it,
                        until he came to the fore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I guess there's some truth to that, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe that's the Egyptian method of keeping one's
                        head.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I imagine it is, and he's been there a long time now. We never expected
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, we're back to what—'94?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: That was...no, '83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '83—that's when the attack was, but I'm talking about
                        where we were on the tape.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>KEENE: Oh, yes, we are. I wanted to say—just to finish that, briefly. One of the
                    first thing we had to do was to get ready for the incredibly huge delegation
                    that came to his funeral, which consisted, I think, of four former presidents,
                    half—that's not true—it seemed like half the senate and a third of the congress.
                    And Begin came too, and it was on the Sabbath, so he had to walk—he couldn't
                    drive, so security for that was enormous. So our delegation walked behind too.
                    Lots of security for that. They couldn't go out to eat, so we had to have a
                    dinner at the hotel where they stayed in Heliopolis. I do remember Nixon getting
                    drunk and making a lot of sort of overly praising the job of the Foreign Service
                    and all that we did. It was a lot of work; I was in charge of the control
                    room.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I was the control room officer...huge delegation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did the control room officer do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, he had to set up the room and provide information, referrals for
                    medical care, drinks, accommodation exchange—anything they wanted, we had to
                    sort of do. And there were a lot of them—that was one of the bigger
                    delegations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Cairo from when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I was in Cairo from 1980 until 1983. And I went to Jerusalem: deputy
                    principal officer. I got very involved in the Palestinian issue.</p>
                <p>

                        always a very tricky position, and how did you get that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I was deputy principal officer. How did I get it? I'm not quite sure; I
                    was chosen, I think, by the to-be-new consul general, Wat Cluverius.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Wat Cluverius IV.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. When I got there, Brandon Grove was still finishing up his term as
                    consul general. After Wat took up the job of coordinator he moved to Tel Aviv
                    and I was acting principal officer for about 10 months. At the end of my tour
                    Morrie Draper took over.</p>

                        describe the situation in Jerusalem in 1983, when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: A consulate that was very heavily focused on supporting the Habib mission,
                    on trying to deal with the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. That was
                    Habib-Draper.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Who visited frequently, going shuttling around the area, trying to work
                    out a deal after Sabra and Shatila to get the Israelis out of Beirut. And
                    because the UN also had their regional headquarters at Government House in
                    Jerusalem, and the involvement of UNIFIL (UN Interim Force in Lebanon) and UNTSO
                    (United Nations Truce Supervision Organization), and various other
                    organizations, as well as the Israeli government—they came to Jerusalem very
                    frequently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe sort of the attitude of the
                        officers—American officers—you were dealing with about the Israeli invasion
                        of Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, I remember one of them saying something to the effect that this was
                    different from the Palestinians: the Lebanese shot back, and that sort of
                    stunned the Israelis, because it really wasn't the Lebanese government—it was
                    various factions, like Hezbollah....and the Palestinians. They were there too. I
                    think by and large everybody saw it—and certainly after the Sabra and Shatila
                    massacres—as orchestrated as much by Sharon as anybody else, and they certainly
                    had no enthusiasm for the Israeli invasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was happening in the Con Gen Jerusalem's area
                        responsibility—was it eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: It was actually all of Jerusalem, which gave us an opportunity to enjoy a
                    bit of a window into Israeli thinking as well as Palestinian: and that was one
                    of the really great things about being there. It was sort of two for the price
                    of one. Many days you could have lunch with an Israeli official and dinner with
                    a Palestinian—the only place, really, where you could get both sides, and it was
                    endlessly complex and fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '83 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: '86.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Palestinians—You didn't have Gaza, or did
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: No, we didn't have Gaza. That was covered out of Tel Aviv, although we
                    went down there frequently, because there were just natural connections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Palestinians doing during this period of
                        time? I mean looking back—a rather quiet time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, in retrospect, yes. After the deal was struck to get the PLO
                    (Palestinian Liberation Organization) out of Lebanon, the focus shifted more to
                    trying to restart the peace process. At that time, it sort of fell to the
                    assistant secretary, Dick Murphy, to take the lead in that effort, so we did a
                    lot of work on that, too. That actually became our focus—trying to understand
                    what was going on in the West Bank and what it might take to promote some sort
                    of progress in the peace process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the period of time when you couldn't talk to the
                        PLO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: That's right. And the Israelis—official Israel—wouldn't talk to us either.
                    We were officially confined to the protocol and consular sections of the Foreign
                    Ministry. But in practice, there were quite a few contacts, socially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the mayor—Teddy</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Teddy Kollek, yes. We had contacts with the municipality. Teddy had a
                    foreign policy advisor, an Arab affairs adviser, and a religious adviser, all
                    became good friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kollek. He was the mayor at the time. He just died, just a
                        few weeks ago. How was he viewed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Very favorably. He understood the situation and was tolerant, tried to
                    promote the Arab sector as well as the Israeli sector. He tried to promote peace
                    and harmony. He had an advisor for foreign affairs from the foreign ministry who
                    sort of was our liaison point within the mayor's office, and he also had an
                    advisor on Arab affairs and we dealt with him too. Teddy was a good guy; he
                    liked a good cigar and a glass of scotch, and he was accessible.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right now—looking at The Washington Post yesterday, they
                        had a long article about how the Israelis are gobbling pieces of Arab
                        Jerusalem. What was the situation, let's say first in Jerusalem; were the
                        Israelis being aggressive to grab things, were there settlement groups?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: This is the same old story that's been going on since '67, really. In
                    those days, they were focusing more on building pretty major settlements
                    surrounding Jerusalem, including what we would have called the West Bank, so as
                    to make it very difficult to re-divide the city. And they were
                    controlling—putting major settlements on the major roads and lines of
                    communication. Building new roads. The same group that you read about in the
                    Post the other day, the Ateret Cohanim, were active then, and they'd started
                    that then—buying a few properties in the Old City (of Jerusalem) and occupying
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what happened? At that time, were we calling the
                        settlements illegal settlements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: At that time we were, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So essentially, these were settlements in the Arab
                        territory, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Therefore they fell under your jurisdiction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you do anything with them? Did you go there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Oh yes, we did. In fact, we started that; the consulate hadn't done that
                    previously. We started visiting settlements and trying to get to know the
                    leadership of the settlement movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the settlements at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, there really were two types: there were those that were
                    ideologically motivated, hard line, right wingers, many of them American
                    citizens; and then there were those who were attracted by the subsidized housing
                    that made it cheaper than settling in Israel proper, and those settlers just
                    sort of used them as a convenient place to live—bedroom communities, if you
                    will.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the American hard-liners? I speak as an old
                        consular officer. People who fly flags of convenience overseas—these are
                        generally people whose allegiance is with the country where they are
                        located—they may be immigrants or not immigrants, but are people...they
                        enjoy all the rights of being citizens of the host country until things get
                        tough, and all of a sudden, they're Americans. Did you find that flag of
                        convenience type thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, there was a lot of that, and a lot of dual nationals, and whatever
                    worked that particular day...Almost everybody would keep their American
                    citizenship—I think as a safety net if things really went south, they'd have a
                    place to go. It was a funny kind of place. We did have the great pleasure of
                    carrying out the Department's decision to lift the citizenship of Meir Kahane
                    while we were there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: And always attacking the Arabs, too. That was the day of the Jewish
                    Underground, when there were secret violent groups...very right-wing Israelis
                    who were doing things such as putting anti-tank rockets into the side of
                    civilian buses and bombs in the cars of the Arab mayors. They were terrorist
                    groups, really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They killed...they blew the legs off some of those Arab

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, they did.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: He became a member of the Knesset. You're not supposed to hold foreign
                    office. That's how they got him. I know the minister of defense was an American
                    citizen also, but when he became minister, he voluntarily surrendered his
                    passport. There was a lot of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude of the Arab leadership? Did they
                        treat you as a last hope or did they treat you as just a bunch of stooges of
                        the Israelis, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>KEENE: I think they were ambivalent. They resented the American role, but what
                    they tried to do, I guess, was to convince us of the righteousness of their
                    cause, so that they might turn American policy around a little bit. It was just
                    a place on both the Israeli and Palestinian side where people lived and breathed
                    politics. And they both loved to talk, so you had no real troubles making
                    contacts, getting information. You really got around and knew a lot of
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go all over the West Bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, all over. Everyday.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Israeli occupying force treat you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: It wasn't too bad. We weren't supposed to have too much contact with them,
                    but occasionally we could make a few contacts inside what they called the civil
                    administration, which was mostly the military administration. We were allowed to
                    talk to some contacts who dealt with refugee affairs, the head of UNRWA (UN
                    Relief and Workers Administration) we could deal with; we had some secret
                    meetings with the head of the civil administration, and tried to do what we
                    could to help out with individual issues and just broader issues of the way the
                    military occupation acted. There were a lot of arbitrary arrests, lots of
                    stories about mistreatment of prisoners, many of whom were Arab-American
                    citizens, so we had the consular function on that side of the issue, too. We
                    went into the jails, visiting these people, doing what we could. We were also
                    allowed contact with Israeli MFA (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) consular
                    officials, religious ministry officials and informal contact with many
                    others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression, and of the officers at the
                        consulate general, of how Arab-Americans who were arrested were
                        treated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: By and large, they were not treated well. They were sometimes physically
                    abused. There were actually quite a large number of them throughout the West
                    Bank, and a lot of them ended up running afoul of the occupation, one way or
                    another. There were actually whole villages which were almost all American
                    citizens in it. We'd go visit them sometimes, and they'd be out there playing
                    baseball. It was a surreal scene.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can understand Jewish-Americans who go to Israel for
                        Zionist causes, but why would Arab-Americans go back to Palestine?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>KEENE: Some because it was a lot easier to live on your social security check
                    there than in the States, some for family reasons, but overall it was more
                    emigration than there were people coming back. That was particularly true of the
                    Christian Palestinians, whose numbers continue to this day to fall kind of
                    dramatically. There aren't too many of them left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, let's say, Arab-Americans who ran afoul
                        of Israelis? I assume you made representation to Israeli authorities. In
                        general, how did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, we could do it several different ways. Officially, it should have
                    been to the consular department of the Foreign Ministry. It also happened during
                    visits to jails. Raising our concerns also occurred during our more informal
                    contacts with higher level officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find them responsive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Not very. We also had a channel through the embassy, the ambassador
                    sometimes....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: At first, Sam Lewis, and then Tom Pickering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the relations with the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: When I got there, they were pretty lousy...a lot of mutual suspicion, and,
                    you know, clashing cables and things like that, but they improved. We had set up
                    a system where we went to their country team meeting every week, and we had a
                    couple of people designated as liaison It got pretty good. I mean we were never
                    going to see things perfectly eye-to-eye, but it wasn't bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find that particular junior officers who
                        were assigned to Jerusalem, would take up, you might say, the cause
                        of—because they were the ones who had seen the mistreated Palestinians and
                        others—taking up the cause of the Palestinians, and in doing so became
                        critical of the Israelis. Was this a problem for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>KEENE: It could be, and in some cases...we did strive for a balance, and
                    certainly it was easy to not like what you saw going on. But we had some very
                    good junior officers. We had an AID program too, and one of them usually was
                    designated as the point of contact for that. That was run through grants to
                    NGO's (non-governmental organizations)—grants to NGO's. One of them who worked
                    with me on this was a young Nick Burns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Undersecretary for Political Affairs. Number three in the
                        State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the, you might say, Israeli organizations, was
                        there any particular group within this that you had to deal with that was
                        particularly hostile, or was it just plain a mixed bag?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: There were definitely very right-wing groups that were very hostile. Not
                    so much in the government, although certainly that strain of thought was present
                    in the Likud and some of the other far right Israeli parties. And that was the
                    time when Begin and then Shamir, the Likud was in power. It was hard to get much
                    out of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Israeli religious community—I think about
                        the Orthodox. Were they sort of off to one side of everything, or were
                        they...how did you find them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, you had the ultra-orthodox, the Hassidics, that's one group; and
                    then you have just sort of the right-wing orthodox, and shades in between to
                    pretty totally secular. That's a big thing in Israeli society and remains so
                    today; there are real splits between the very right-wing religious and the more
                    secular westernized segment of society. It was kind of a...a lot of the real
                    right-wingers—you might get to talk to them, but they didn't want to have a lot
                    to do with you. We knew a lot of Israelis; we'd go to their homes for social
                    affairs. You could talk to a pretty broad spectrum of people. And they have a
                    lot of organizations, too...you had this group or that group that you go call on
                    and talk to. We got to know a lot of former officials who were in academia who
                    really knew—well-connected people—former generals, this, that and the other
                    thing. We'd be up at Hebrew University all the time, talking with them, too. We
                    got around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Hebrew University? Were they trying to
                        work as a bridge with the Arab population, or were they really
                        representative of the sort of straight Jewish side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>KEENE: No, I think that they were...Well, there were people up there that ran the
                    spectrum, too, but on balance, I thought it was a pretty impressive
                    organization. They had a lot of very impressive people working there who did try
                    to understand what was going on in the Arab sector and in the Arab world. Some
                    of them knew a great deal and were pretty well connected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, right now when we've over time seen places that can
                        really start clashes in the various holy sites, particularly Muslim holy
                        sites. During your time were there any particular problems there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Oh, yes. We had a big issue over the so-called Hasmonean tunnel, Israeli
                    archeological digs near the Western Wall that provoked protests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: It was an ancient tunnel they were trying to excavate, but it was right
                    next to the wall, to the Haram Es-Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary, and suspicions
                    always run high when the Israelis do that that they're trying to make a
                    territorial grab in what has been an area that Palestinians consider
                    administered by the waqf, for the trust, the Islamic trust. So that went on for
                    a long time, and we had stuff like that happen all the time—occasional riots
                    after Friday prayers, occasional shutdowns of the Temple Mount. Always an issue,
                    but that was typical of the whole area and wasn't just an Israeli-Arab thing;
                    you also had all the Christian groups fighting among themselves over control of
                    the various parts of the various holy places. It was a unique place, and you
                    just really had to well...you got interested in it—not everybody would be, I
                    guess, but you can get into the differences between the Greek Orthodox and the
                    Russian Orthodox and the Ethiopian Orthodox and the Syrian Orthodox—all of those
                    groups and their interaction. One that was very interesting was we had the white
                    Russians and the red Russians, and Russia had no representation at that time, so
                    they used the church members as their unofficial channel. So, it was
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First, let's talk about the American tourist, the strange
                        sort of Christian tourist. Were they a problem or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>KEENE: Generally not. I mean you're always going to have the stray citizen who
                    gets in some kind of trouble, and you have to try to help them out—citizen
                    services and things like that. But a lot of the Christian groups would come in
                    fairly large, organized tour groups. They'd get on their bus and go around; we
                    had a lot of Jewish-American groups came too, as tourists, or as part of their
                    American-Jewish Congress sponsorship or something like that. They were generally
                    not much trouble either. That wasn't a big issue. Well, you had the guy who
                    thought he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ; he'd get himself eventually in
                    trouble. You know, the people who have psychiatric problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I went to the archives and did athis was back in
                        '84, so I was in the historian's office the year before I retired, and I did
                        a paper on our consul in Jerusalem in the 1870s. The American Colony, for
                        example, one of the cults at the time, where the leader of the Americans
                        there...I can't think of his name—the family's still around, but he and the
                        senior members—male members—absorbed the wives of some of the other members.
                        I mean, there was a lot of that sort of hanky-panky going on, which often
                        happens in cults. And then, again, we had one guy—he was earlier, who
                        arrived, declared he was the consul, American consul, had never been
                        approved, and then eventually converted to Judaism and disappeared into the
                        woodwork. But the Turks accepted him as the American consul for awhile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>As a consular officer, how did you treat...I arrive in Jerusalem and decide I'm
                    Jesus, and am wandering around declaring this and maybe putting out robes, or
                    something</p>
                <p>KEENE: We had a few.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, it's pretty hard to deal with them until their actions become so
                    bizarre that they trigger a reaction by the host government. Sometimes they'd go
                    violent. I mean, they're just troubled people. If they got into some trouble,
                    you tried to get them some help...either from their family or if they needed
                    psychiatric help or repatriation...every situation on its own merits, I guess.
                    We had a few.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Absolutely. I think I had a count at one point. When I was there I think I
                    met over 400 members one way or another.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, this is such a political almost third rail, that
                        I would think that ...I mean, every time that there is a presidential
                        primary in New York state, all the candidates support moving our embassy to
                        Jerusalem. Although we all know this is sort of a charade, I would think
                        with politicians you couldn't talk about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, some politicians know that, and some don't. It depends. It was
                    usually a little different there, because we would usually split these CODELs
                    with the embassy in Tel Aviv. They'd take them to go see the prime minister or
                    whoever and then some of them wanted to come and talk to a few members of the
                    Palestinian leadership and see how things were. And some of them did it but
                    weren't too interested in spending a lot of time doing it. So we would maybe get
                    them only for a day, and we'd host a lunch or a dinner or take them around the
                    West Bank to call on some of the mayors or tailor a program to what they were
                    interested in. There were a lot of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find life there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I loved it. It was fascinating. It was before the intifada (Palestinian
                    uprising); I didn't feel a lot of danger. I never knew, but we used to say they
                    hated each other so much they'd sort of ignore us. That turned out to be pretty
                    much true until later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about immigration: were you running a fairly large
                        visa program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, pretty large. We had two different buildings in those days—one in the
                    west side and one in the east, and the consular section was in the east. We had
                    lovely buildings—old, beautiful, historic landmark-type buildings. A lot of the
                    Israelis didn't like that because they had to go to east Jerusalem to get their
                    consular services. But it really wasn't deep into East Jerusalem; it's not very
                    far from the American Colony, which in those days, at least, was one of the very
                    few sort of neutral meeting places where both sides didn't mind going at the
                    same time. So we could have stuff there and get away with promoting dialogue a
                    little bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a fairly active USIA (United States Information
                        Agency) program there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes—modest, but yes. We only had a single American officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>

                <p>KEENE: Well, Bill Cavness at first and then his successor, David Good. But that
                    was curious, too, because the embassy also had an office in Jerusalem, staffed
                    by another USIA officer Arthur Green. So, you had that coordination problem that
                    you had to work out, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you feel that you spent an awful lot of the time
                        vetting anything that anybody...every piece of paper that you put out, or
                        letters, or announcements, or anything else, to make sure that you weren't
                        setting off vibrations that would come back and haunt you by showing that
                        you were either too pro-Arab or too pro-Israeli?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Oh, yes, for sure. It got to be second nature after a while to find out
                    where all the land mines are. But that was part of the fun...and all the
                    diversity and different views and trying. I mean we consciously set out to try
                    to improve relations with the embassy and the Jewish community and the
                    Jewish-American organizations, and the consulate was generally hated by them and
                    mostly “biased” and “anti-Israeli.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems of your officers being accused by
                        newspapers in the halls of Congress as being pro-Arab and anti-Israeli?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, it happened. It wasn't too bad then. We got to work with the
                    Arab-American groups, proactively helping them schedule appointments with our
                    CODELs and things like that. Socializing with them, getting to know them. We got
                    to know a lot of the Israeli press, too. That helped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How'd you find the press?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, they have a right-wing press, but they have a lot of people who are
                    pretty good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Jerusalem Post. How is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: In those days it was liberal. Now it's right-wing. They had good, solid,
                    English-speaking reporters—it was an English-language paper, and we got to know
                    them well. That helped. They'd come to our receptions.</p>

                <p>KEENE: They're a group apart. There's a very big area in Jerusalem that's
                    Hassidic, Mea Shearim. They are ultra-orthodox: no driving cars on Saturday, or
                    anything like that, so if you tried to drive through that area, they'd throw
                    stones at you. There were riots sometimes. There are some 90 separate Hassidic
                    groups, and it's very hard to figure out all of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as Lubavitcher. They consider that the messiah hasn't
                        come yet and therefore the whole Zionist cause is a fraud.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. And there's another even more screwy group, Neturei Karta, who
                    believe that the state of Israel is illegitimate, and they support the PLO.
                    Really! When the PLO went to Madrid two or three Israelis of this sect went with
                    them. And the leader of that group's an American, so he would bug us all the
                    time. He was quite a character. He knew he was running a fraudulent operation,
                    but...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel under any particular threat, you or the
                        consulate of bombing and other things like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: You know, not particularly. We had bomb threats and we had—that was the
                    era when we were starting to tighten up on security and we had a major security
                    upgrade program which caused us some little concern, because we were in an
                    historic building and had to preserve that under Israeli law and we didn't want
                    to put ugly concrete barriers on the sidewalk out front. Kollek didn't want them
                    either, so we had to do some nice planters out there. But I didn't really—I mean
                    we tried to be prudent, but it wasn't something that kept me up at night, no. We
                    felt we had a pretty good network and knew a lot about what was going on. There
                    was violence. I know one of my very good contacts was the mayor of Nablus, and
                    he was assassinated by the PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine)
                    while I was there.</p>

                <p>KEENE: Palestinian Front for the Liberation of Palestine. It was one of
                    the...they were splintered into five or six groups; that was one of the more
                    radical ones. Anyway...and then we had the Jewish underground to worry about,
                    and the mayors certainly did. There was violence, but it just didn't...we just
                    didn't seem to be major targets.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Disneyland. It was almost unreal—picturesque and well kept. It was a place
                    where nothing ever went wrong. There was never a robbery or a traffic accident
                    or any bad news ever heard of or reported.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First of all, what sort of government does Muscat

                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>KEENE: There was a sultan; it's a monarchy. And it was the current sultan's
                    father who locked the gate at night and who forbade, essentially, modernization.
                    There was, like, one school, about two kilometers of paved road, one health
                    facility. It was illegal to wear glasses, it was illegal to be out past the gate
                    after dark, all kinds of amazing restrictions. They must have been living in
                    the—I don't know—17th or 18th century. The current sultan overthrew his father
                    and started a modernization process. Then they got a little oil money and really
                    rebuilt the place. Too much so, in the view of some, because they just ripped
                    down the ancient walls and replaced them.</p>
                <p>Our embassy was in a historic house, so it was right down near the palace, on the
                    water, just about, and just a beautiful building—the ownership of one of the
                    very, very wealthy families at that time, the Zawawis, one of whom was the
                    minister of finance and one of whom was the advisor to the sultan. Some of the
                    richest men in the world. Then we had another building right there, also in the
                    compound, Beit Nassib. The British Embassy was next door—another nice old
                    building. Then they decided they didn't want that so they were forcing
                    diplomatic missions out into a new diplomatic area on the beach. And so there
                    weren't very many left downtown...two or three when I got there. Then they
                    wanted us to move, too, and that was fine, because FBO ( Foreign Buildings
                    Office) wanted to put one of those new, secure buildings there, so that went on
                    when I was there, and we moved into it maybe six months before I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any sort of program going on in Muscat when you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: The major issue of the day really was our response—well, two things: we
                    sought access to facilities agreement with Oman, and we started an escort
                    operation for oil tankers in the gulf, because the Iraq-Iran war was going on.
                    The facilities thing really was sparked at the end of the Carter administration
                    by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and we sought agreements with Oman and
                    Somalia, Kenya and later on, Qatar, UAE, Kuwait. British influence was very
                    strong still in Oman; it had been—well, legally, rather a strange situation. I
                    don't think it was ever formally a protectorate, but it was all but run by the
                    Brits for a while. Still a very strong influence—particularly strong in the
                    military, navy.</p>
                <p>One major fallout of the escort operation was the shooting down of an Iran air
                    passenger jet by the USS Vincennes.</p>
                <p>As part of the facilities agreement, we agreed to set up a small AID program and
                    an International Military Education and Training (IMET) program and sell some
                    military equipment. That meant we had a facilities maintenance team, a defense
                    attach� office, an office of military cooperation (OMC) and an AID mission. This
                    in an embassy with one pol-econ officer plus a JO (junior officer), one
                    part-time consular officer and a three person admin section (two of whom were
                    JO's).</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the Trucial Oman Scouts were quite a ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: There was Trucial Oman, too—well, all these little sheikdoms had tangled
                    boundaries, and a lot of what was Trucial Oman is now UAE. Oman is actually
                    split by part of the UAE. There's the bulk of Oman, then a strip of the UAE,
                    then out at the Musandam, at the tip, of the peninsula Omani again. But at that
                    time their navy and their air force were commanded by British officers. British
                    officers served in the ranks in the army and played a very major role. So that
                    was a little different. We're kind of used to being a preeminent power in many
                    countries; we were definitely number two there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, when I was in Dhahran—we're talking about the late
                        1950s, the British troops were fighting in the Jabal al Akhdar, the Green
                        Mountains. Was anything going on there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, that was the Dhofar Rebellion, yes. No, we could go to the Jabal; it
                    was pacified; it was mountainous and that was quite beautiful. But there was
                    still fallout from the Dhofar Rebellion. Dhofar was treated in an especially
                    delicate way, and they made sure that there was balance in the cabinet and in
                    the army, and the sultan had his winter palace in Salalah, the major port in
                    Dhofar. So, it was treated with kid gloves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Yemen? I mean, there were two Yemens; this would
                        be over to eastern Yemen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: North and south. It was South Yemen. Aden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Aden was a rather virulent socialist thing; how were
                        relations along the border when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: It's a very wild and difficult border—mountainous, very sparsely
                    populated. There were border flare-ups from time to time. It caused the Omanis
                    to build a very expensive road so that they could get into that area with their
                    military and repel incursions, set up some border stations. So we did have
                    incidents; we didn't have major outbreaks, though. A concern, but not a major,
                    major issue.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Cranwell Montgomery, a political appointee. I was charg� for my final
                    eight or nine months as his replacement, Dick Boehm, had to wait a long time to
                    be confirmed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, the negotiation was protracted, but finally agreed. That was led
                    essentially out of Washington, out of PM (Bureau of Political-Military Affairs,
                    Dept. of State). They got those agreements, and then—and there was lots and lots
                    of haggling about every little step of implementation, particularly—most of the
                    stuff was for the air force, and the head of the air force there was British—Air
                    Vice Marshall Eric Bennett—he was a tough nut to deal with. He knew an awful
                    lot, a very experienced guy who had done this sort of thing before, and he
                    wanted to extract the maximum out of every issue. So, it took a long time, but
                    eventually we ended up fulfilling the agreement, had an awful lot of stuff
                    there, and then we had a group of people to maintain it. They were mostly
                    contractors, but it meant a few extra air force officers on the staff. And as
                    part of that deal, we agreed to provide them with a little military assistance,
                    and a little bit of military training. They share the Straits of Hormuz.
                    Historically—Oman has a very interesting history. Historically, they had
                    occupied the Iranian side of the strait, too, for several centuries. And
                    Baluchistan, and what's now Pakistan, and they had a little empire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Down to Dar-es-Salaam, and Zanzibar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Which is another interesting. Anyway, now, of course, the balance of power
                    has shifted, and they'd be happy to be our allies, but they never want to
                    antagonize the Iranians while they're at it. So, their sensitivities were
                    touched. But, eventually, didn't involve them too much directly. The Omani
                    Foreign Minister was always asking us if he could carry some message for us to
                    Tehran; we very rarely took him up on that. And later—or earlier—I forget the
                    time, the ships escorting the tankers had had a run-in with some Iranian boats,
                    and there had been an exchange of fire, and we'd captured a number of Iranian—I
                    think they turned out to be Revolutionary Guard. We didn't really want to keep
                    them, so we arranged an exchange, and that took place in Muscat. That was a big
                    deal, too. We had to set all that up, and the International Committee of the Red
                    Cross was involved, and Oman had to agree, and then they flew them in on a bunch
                    of military helicopters and handed them over at the airport. Our military
                    was—Oman was perfectly peaceful—but they were very nervous and high
                    strung—weapons all over the place.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any Iranian revolutionary groups trying to stir

                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>KEENE: They had an embassy, and there was some intelligence from time to time,
                    and there was a Shia community. There was some intelligence they were trying to
                    gain some influence over that group. Nothing happened when I was there; later, I
                    understand there were some religious demonstrations that did occur. Exactly why
                    or how, or what was behind them, I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was the sultan making any move to bring about a
                        better deal for Omani women or for democratization, or anything like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, but it was really glacial. He did set up a consultative council, at
                    first appointed, later partially elected with so many seats set aside for women.
                    That's it, as far as I can tell; don't get a lot of news about Oman in the
                    paper, but I don't think it's progressed a lot.</p>

                    (United States Central Command) that's there and some facilities there, and some
                    communications gear and various other things. We used to go up there; that was
                    about the only country you could get to from Oman, and it was just staggeringly
                    modern and well developed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you drive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. Of all things, there were international softball tournaments held up
                    there; they were fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I take it that with modest oil wealth, there was no
                        such thing as had happened with the Arab Emirates.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: No, they're more modest. I mean, it's not so bad; I think they're now
                    close to 700,000 barrels a day, and for a country with a population of only a
                    couple of million, it's adequate, and they've developed quite a bit. But it's
                    not like the UAE, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it this was not a place you got many tourists or
                        congressional delegations, or that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>KEENE: Actually, when we got there, there were no tourists, and they finally
                    started to open it up, but on a selective basis. And they didn't want any young
                    ones; they wanted older, organized groups. Now I understand that it's easier,
                    because, I mean, there's a constituency for tourism. There are a lot of pretty
                    wealthy businessmen who want to fill their hotel rooms and things like that. And
                    it's a beautiful country. I guess there is some tourism now, but we actually
                    went from nothing; we saw the start of it, and it was very modest. We had some
                    CODELs, but not many; those that did come were interested in the pre-positioning
                    thing. Some people came. You know who came—Baker came, had a Secretary Baker
                    visit in my last week or two on the job there. It turns out that the first
                    President Bush had told him what a nice place it was for a rest stop, so he
                    dropped in...dropped in to see it, but not too demanding in terms of
                    visitors.</p>

                <p>KEENE: As far away from having to take a formal position as they possibly could.

                <p>KEENE: No. It wasn't easy to get it. It was there; they were a bit afraid to talk
                    too much. But, you keep working at it, you make some friends, you get around,
                    you hear this, you hear that, somebody drinks too much.</p>

                <p>KEENE: It's a mildly narcotic leaf. No, they didn't do that there. The government

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, a place to get away. They would travel; a lot of them had a fair
                    amount of money, and they would go to London. A surprising number of them had
                    big houses in Washington, actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Omani women; did you get any feel for their
                        role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: This is where the history of an empire makes it interesting. When Tanzania
                    became independent, you know Zanzibar joined Tanganyika. They pretty much
                    expelled the Arab community, which was essentially Omanis, most of whom then
                    returned to Oman, where most of them had never been. And they were speaking
                    Swahili, and not Arabic. So you had an integration problem that goes on to this
                    day. The other side of that coin is that they were generally much better
                    educated, because remember, the old sultan didn't let anybody go to school. So,
                    they got this literate cadre of people back, and to the resentment of many,
                    because of their education, they landed government jobs. But the women there
                    were not retiring; they were used to participating in commercial life, political
                    life, and that's still true today, too. The Zanzibari women have formed the
                    women's organizations, the women's faculty at the university, run businesses, do
                    this. The Omanis—indigenous Omanis—don't do much of that, so it's
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>Then, there are the Baluchis. They had been recruited for the army under the old
                    sultan, and they came over from Baluchistan, of course, and many, many just
                    settled there. Or they were given some land as a reward for their service,
                    and—there's just a lot, so they're a distinct group, too, within the
                    society.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they pick, religious-wise, as a whole group,
                        there in Oman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: There's some Shia there, mostly from the sub-continent, originally. Oman's
                    trading patterns were different than most of the Arab world; they traded with
                    India, Iran...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Following the trade winds.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, exactly, which you don't see in most of the Arab world. It snuck into
                    their food, and there are people who may now have intermarried, but originated
                    in India, or what is now Pakistan. They moved there, and they set up shop, so
                    you have that small community. But the majority of Omanis are Ibadi—neither Shia
                    nor Sunni. And it's a very tolerant branch of Islam, practiced only, I am told,
                    in Oman, and for some reason, Tunisia. I don't know how that worked out. You
                    don't get a lot of religious strife; you do get a little anti-Shia
                    sentiment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the period, I guess, when the Saudis were
                        setting up the religious schools, the madrassas, which preached a form of
                        rather intolerant Wahhabism; was that going on there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Not in Oman. No. I heard later that there were some arrests that took
                    place—this was after I left—of people who were accused of being over-fanatic in
                    their religious beliefs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything going on such as explorations—people
                        like the National Geographic looking for lost cities and all of that? The
                        area had been much more fertile at one time, hadn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Absolutely. It was on the old frankincense road. Yes, there were
                    archeological sites that could be visited. Later they found more; a lot of those
                    were in Dhofar. There were also a series of quite ancient inland forts that you
                    could visit. And the area had been briefly colonized by the Portuguese. At the
                    entrance to Muscat harbor, on each side is a massive Portuguese fort that is
                    very picturesque, right downtown, where the palace is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a place where up and coming Omanis went away to

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, mostly to London. We have some in the States, but mostly in London.
                    There is a university there now; it was fairly new in those days: Sultan Qaboos
                    University.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were relations with the British embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>KEENE: Good. We made it a point, recognizing their influence, to get along with
                    them. There were those in the mission who resented the Brits, but I never
                    thought that was going to get you anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Omani government—how was the foreign
                        ministry, and was it an effective government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, but...Well, I knew a lot of people in the foreign ministry, but there
                    it was typical, I guess, of a new government, and it was really only the
                    minister, and maybe the undersecretary, who was going to make any decision. So
                    you had to get to know those people. It was all very well to know the head of
                    the American section...And in a lot of those ministries, you'd walk in there,
                    and people just reading the newspaper, drinking coffee.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel much the heavy hand of the Arabian peninsular

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Arabian Peninsular Affairs. No, not too much; I don't think we were high
                    on their list of priorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, I think they had other things to do.

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes; after the escorts started, constantly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: They had a nice, modern port at Mutrah. We'd get the authority for it;
                    they'd come in, tie up for a couple of days. The sailors would get leave, not
                    that there was an awful lot for a sailor to do in Muscat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, could you sort of bus them off to a park, or the
                        equivalent thereof?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. They'd set that up, out to see a fort or one of the old houses. There
                    was a city that was only about an hour away called Nizwa, that had a fort and a
                    souk, so that was good for visiting people. You could do that. The hotels
                    actually were allowed to serve alcohol to foreigners, so it was liberal to that
                    extent. And they'd re-provision there—one of the reasons they'd come in.
                    Ironically, most of their vegetables were via Iran. So, we were in a position of
                    buying Iranian goods while we were patrolling the gulf. No, we had a whole lot
                    of ship visits.</p>

                <p>KEENE: Never saw it, in those days, no.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, I had just reported for duty about two weeks before the invasion.</p>

                        you're the brand new guy on the block, and all of a sudden there were noises
                        that Saddam Hussein was stirring things up. What was the feeling you were

                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>KEENE: Well, there was a lot of uncertainty, and then we had the now infamous
                    April Glaspie report of her meeting with Hussein, which made it look like maybe
                    something could be worked out. I had reported directly to work, and I had put
                    off my home leave; so right about then, I got two weeks off! And then the
                    invasion took place while I was on vacation. It was a shock, really, and, you
                    know, it was very intense. We really, really worked incredible hours as the
                    buildup to our invasion took place. Very intense diplomatic effort worldwide to
                    build the coalition, to get the UN resolutions approved, to get the money.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, no, I guess I'd have to say. I was trying to run the office. I was
                    doing the overall pieces, the memo for the Baker trips, the memo for the

                <p>KEENE: Right. The secretary did a lot of that himself, and the
                    undersecretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Saudi response?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: It was really pretty forthcoming, for them. They had always resisted too
                    visible a presence on their soil: and they gave us pretty good access to their
                    facilities, and let us stage things through there. I mean, particularly after
                    they themselves were attacked, they were happy to. You remember briefly that
                    incursion out of Kuwait? So, for them, they were quite forthcoming, I thought,
                    because the Kuwaitis were totally desperate. We had the Kuwaiti ambassador
                    living in our office there for about a month, and willing to pony up really vast
                    amounts</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Their money was basically in Iraq ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, and some of it here, outside, Switzerland probably, too, for all I
                    know. Yes, they had billions. As always, other people were trying to use this
                    crisis to...I remember the Turkish desk, in particular, was “Ah well, now's our
                    chance to get some Saudi money to bolster the Turks. Even Uruguay, to join the
                    coalition, they wanted the U.S. Army to buy their meet for rations, and it just
                    went on and on, and everybody wanted something. So, we spent some time beating
                    that sort of thing off.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression being back there; was this a
                        pretty experienced, well-oiled machine that was dealing with the
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, it really was. Pretty soon we had the task force, but then we had a
                    group that would gather daily to coordinate moves that was interagency, and the
                    bureaus. We'd go over really all the issues with the assistant secretary
                    everyday. This meeting was soon dubbed “vespers.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: It was John Kelly. We'd have a morning meeting and an afternoon meeting,
                    and the morning meeting was with Deputy Assistant Secretary David Mack and the
                    afternoon meeting with Kelly. And then the task force was always there, so there
                    was good coordination with the task force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the actual war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling before the war started; what were you
                        getting? You know, you all were looking at this; how did you think this was
                        going to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: We had moved massive forces into the area, and I don't know; most people
                    couldn't seem to read those military cables, but I could, because I had all that
                    PM time. I had to explain to them how much stuff was out there. I was pretty
                    confident we were going to win the war; I didn't have much doubt about that. And
                    I didn't have any doubt that it was going to happen. But once it started, in
                    some ways we had less to do. Control passed to DOD much more than during the
                    intense period of diplomacy leading up to it. And then we shifted into preparing
                    for reconstruction of Kuwait, primarily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you get to that point, was anybody talking about, I
                        mean I realize that it had more to do with Iraq—well, it had everything to
                        do with Iraq. But talk about the end game, because it does seem that we put
                        Schwarzkopf into the...said, “You go settle this.” I mean, after all, we
                        knew that it was going to come to an end. Was anybody working on what we
                        should do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>KEENE: Not so much in my office as the area, whatever they were called then,
                    Iraq-Iran affairs or something, but they had the primary responsibility for
                    that. How much actual planning they did down there, I don't know; whether that
                    was planned or they made it up as the circumstances dictated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I've interviewed Chas Freeman, who was at one point
                        our ambassador to Saudi Arabia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, I know him very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He at one point, he said in an equivalent to a cable,
                        saying, not really to you, but to the Iran-Iraq...I mean, “What is the end
                        game?” I mean, all of this struck me as being a—I don't know what you call
                        it—a blunder or a lack, or something—not to say exactly what wanted, because
                        we left a general there who made a deal about allowing helicopters to fly
                        and all that, which turned out to be counterproductive and has had great
                        consequences as of we speak today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. That's right. I didn't get involved. We did a lot of work on Kuwait,
                    but not on Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much were you picking up, even before hand, because a
                        lot of Palestinians had gone to Kuwait and then were in the gulf area? What
                        had you, over your time, before this all happened, picked up about the
                        Kuwaitis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Arrogant, unlikable, too rich for their own good, not well liked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a problem as you moved into reconstruction and
                        all that; were you finding the UAE and the Saudis and others were getting
                        involved in this? They didn't want to do much for the Kuwaitis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: No, they didn't. But Kuwait had their own money. We set up a whole
                    organization, the Kuwait Reconstruction Organization, to deal with that. The
                    Corps of Engineers got involved, and we sent a guy out to live with the Kuwait
                    government in exile; that was Skip Gnehm, and he had a few assistants with him.
                    There was just a lot of thought: what to do with the oil wells, what to do with
                    the infrastructure. I think we were pretty well ready to do that job. Like
                    everything, there were some problems, but it went okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you left there in 1990. Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I spent nine months in the Senior Seminar and then went to Amman.
                    Jordan.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went there in '91, and you were there from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: '91 to '94.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Roger Harrison for most of the time. I was charg� for about eight months
                    and then near the very end, Wes Egan arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've interviewed both of them. Can you describe the
                        attitude towards Jordan when you went out there, at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Oh, it was bad times; it was a very strained relationship. They had
                    opposed our invasion of Iraq, and there were demonstrations outside the embassy.
                    People didn't want to deal with us on the ground there. Things were not
                    good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they beginning to settle down, because I would have
                        thought, you know, after time, a lot of the Jordanians, and particularly the
                        Palestinians who worked there, the Kuwaitis had been kind of beastly to
                        them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But after you put a half a million troops into Kuwait and
                        all that, I would have thought that they would have sort of bowed to force
                        majeure or something like that. Is it okay or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: No. I think the government was interested in maintaining a relationship
                    and probably interested in gradually improving it; but the war had been so
                    unpopular domestically, that they were not in a position to move too fast.
                    Jordan did something like 80 per cent of its trade with Iraq. So, they were
                    hurting financially, too. And they were hard put to get any oil, for that
                    matter. Iraq had supplied virtually all its oil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there, what were you getting—before you went
                        out, actually, about King Hussein. What was the feeling towards him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>KEENE: I guess it would depend who you spoke with, but there were a lot of people
                    who were bitter, who felt that he had betrayed us; an old ally and friend should
                    have been more forthcoming. There were those who understood that he was in a
                    hard spot, too,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he really was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've seen this happen at other times. This is a Washington
                        syndrome, where if somebody, particularly a small country, does something at
                        a time when we have great interest in a situation, and one of the small
                        countries doesn't go along with us, we get not only bitter, but there are
                        people who are trying to take it out on them. I imagine you've run across
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Oh yes. There's that, for sure, and it's always somebody on the Hill who
                    wants to make a few political points. It's the nature of the beast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were DCM again? What was the embassy doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, they had actually cut way back on the number of people who were out
                    there. It was felt that with so many demonstrations and so much bad feeling,
                    that it was dangerous. So it was kind of small. I got there and the next morning
                    there was some high level visitor coming in. So they were starting now to try to
                    put things back together; just at the very early phases of doing that. Which was
                    good for me; I mean, first day there I met the foreign minister and this guy and
                    that guy and got going pretty quickly. I found that they were, well, so many of
                    them were Palestinians, but the Jordanians, too, were like them—hospitable
                    people, even though they might not like your policies. Bound by that Arab
                    hospitality, and they loved to talk, and it was just easy to meet people and
                    start picking up on what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern at the time and while you were there,
                        that King Hussein might be overthrown and something of a radical government
                        might come in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Not really. There always was the chance that he might be assassinated, but
                    not that he would be overthrown. The military was viewed as loyal to the king;
                    they were really the only people who could have done that. Of course, he paid a
                    lot of attention to his military, too. The King was really, genuinely very
                    popular. But, for its size, it's a pretty impressive country. Education is a
                    high value; a pretty literate population. Some pretty impressive ministers and
                    generals.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe in some ways they've been sort of blessed by not
                        having oil, which seems to basically create a wealthy, indolent class.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. No oil, no oil at all. And not much else. There's a little
                    phosphorus, phosphate, but not much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean, I would have thought that the Jordanians
                        must have had a rather heavy exodus of Palestinians who had been working in
                        Kuwait.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who had basically been a pretty spoiled group. I mean,
                        they'd done very well for themselves there, and all of a sudden, here they
                        were, destitute.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, there was a large number. I forget the figure now, but it was
                    significant. And that put further strains on a not all that wealthy social net
                    there. They seem to have—and this was a big issue at first, but by the time I
                    left it wasn't much. They seem to have been absorbed, at least in an acceptable
                    way. Anyway, I think it was Baker who visited, because I think he had said he
                    would make good on his pre-war promise to try to reinvigorate the peace process,
                    and he was making the rounds.</p>

                <p>KEENE: Yes. The first steps</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Baker came to Jordan, did he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, several times before I was finished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The first time after the war...was it sort of a frosty
                        meeting, or how did it go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: It wasn't too bad, because of the subject. They were interested in seeing
                    the peace process revived, so they welcomed this initiative. Baker was very
                    good; he seemed to be able to get along with people pretty well. He knew his
                    stuff, made good presentation.</p>

                <p>KEENE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, realistically, I think the king had his supporters, he had several
                    on his payroll, but he had lost it, and it wasn't going to revert to Jordan. And
                    I think they recognized that, but they still wanted to play those games to keep
                    up whatever amount of influence they could. They hated Arafat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they'd been through the Black September, back in
                        1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Right. And they tried to kill the king. I used to play tennis with a
                    former primer minister who would show you the bullet holes that he got in that
                    assassination attempt. No love lost. Nevertheless, for their own reasons, they
                    wanted the peace process to succeed; and it was hard for them to move without
                    some Palestinian movement. With a population over half Palestinian, they are
                    very sensitive to the public opinion in that part of their population. Within
                    Jordan, there are significant strains between Palestinians and others: and
                    there's discrimination and fighting for power, influence, and all these kind of
                    things that they try very hard to keep below the surface, but its there. So for
                    their own reasons, they wanted to see some movement on this. You couldn't cut a
                    separate deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you aware of Jordanian-Israeli relations at the
                        time. I mean, apparently it had been going on for years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, and it went on during this period. The king would get in his
                    helicopter and fly over for the meeting. From time to time, he'd smuggle in some
                    Israeli officials for meetings. I don't know that we found out about every one
                    of them, but we knew what was going on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did congress people come over to Jordan while you were

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. After the peace process started up again, they did. Right after the
                    war there really weren't many, but then they started coming again, in increasing
                    numbers. And so eventually, it was pretty heavy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a pretty heavy divide between sort of the
                        Palestinians and the, I guess you call them the Bedouins?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: East Bankers, yes. A lot of them originally were Bedouin, originally
                    tribal, but modernized. Yes, that was real serious difference—many cutting
                    remarks, in private.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given the situation there, was the PLO...had they made any
                        sort of amends, or was there any reconciliation at all between the Jordanian
                        government and the Arafat people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: At an official level there was; Arafat was being received again by the
                    palace and was speaking to the king. No love lost, but as a practical matter. So
                    he would visit Amman every couple of months. The PLO had an embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the other Arab states: Egypt, particularly,
                        Saudi Arabia, Syria? What were they doing in Jordan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I don't recall that they were all that active. The Egyptians are always
                    good and professional. Despite the chaos of their country, they have a pretty
                    good foreign service. I didn't see a lot of the Saudis.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, oh yes. For sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we deal with the Iraqis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I think for a while we couldn't, at least until the peace was agreed, if I
                    remember correctly. And then we didn't see them much, except at diplomatic corps
                    gatherings. They weren't a big player, but after awhile they became important
                    again to the Jordanians, because they started providing oil again, as they had
                    prior to the war—mostly trucked in. I guess some went down to Aqaba by ship
                    after they cleared the channel out, which took a while. So that by the time I
                    had left they were providing about 100 percent of their oil—88, 85, or 90
                    percent of their oil.</p>

                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>KEENE: Not a big one. They did have a mission, were suspected of occasional
                    nefarious dealings, but they didn't have a big impact.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Not at that time. They had, earlier. It wasn't too bad with Syria then;
                    the border was open—it was a bit chaotic, but lots of people going back and
                    forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about for you all; could you get around to various

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, we used to go up to Damascus, Syria and other places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have much of a, say, like a USIA organization there
                        in Amman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: In Amman, yes, we did, definitely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A library and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: We had the library, the speakers, the programs, the international
                    visitors—a full gamut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you got there, had we a pretty good cadre of
                        Jordanians who had been to the United States on visitor's visas, or educated
                        there, come back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes—It's known as the Georgetown (Georgetown University) mafia. I think
                    half the cabinet was educated at Georgetown. We have a lot of students here,
                    yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They ever have Georgetown alumni gatherings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Actually, they did, every now and then. They really had some pretty
                    talented people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way, it must have been at least more
                        intellectually stimulating than being in Oman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Oh yes, for sure, it was. These were very cosmopolitan people who were
                    well informed...and liked to talk!</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your Jordanian contacts, was there any particular
                        feeling about how the Arab-Israeli—well, the Arab-Israeli problem was not
                        yet settled. I mean, was there a feeling of hope because of Madrid and all
                        that, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: There might have been a little hope, but there was no euphoria. The road
                    was rocky. And they needed the Palestinians to at least do enough that they
                    weren't looked at as being betrayed by unilateral moves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Arafat viewed that you get from your

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Very negatively...and that includes Palestinians. He was a symbol, but he
                    wasn't viewed as a very good leader or very good administrator, and he was very
                    corrupt.And they knew it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any major incident or visits while you were

                        had a presidential visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: No. Secretarial: five, six, ten, I don't know how many there were—a
                    lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But these were of such a nature that it was shuttle
                        type?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, a lot of it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that didn't—you know. Put quite a burden on you
                        all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Oh yes, sure. You know, it takes a lot of work to support those things.
                    No. One incident stands out that...toward the end, the king got cancer and went
                    to the Mayo Clinic for treatment. And the word was that he had substantially
                    recovered—it turned out not to be true, but that's what people thought. And when
                    he came back, it was like something you'd never seen. I mean, millions of people
                    turned out into the streets. And he rode through the crowds; he got out of his
                    armored car and got on the roof of the car and drove. A tumultuous welcome.
                    Quite moving. And then, of course, later, it recurred, or whatever, and he
                    passed away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you left there in 1994? Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>KEENE: Back to Washington. No, actually, no. Before we leave Jordan, I guess I
                    should mention that I did go to Madrid for the peace conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: They brought all the DCMs (deputy chiefs of mission). And then Roger got
                    in a traffic accident on his way to Madrid and never made it. And because of the
                    fact that nobody recognized the PLO at the time, we had to set up the joint
                    Jordanian-Palestinian delegation in Madrid, which was a very useful diplomatic
                    device, but it meant responsibility for two delegations instead of one. So that
                    was interesting, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: We were assigned to the delegation as their liaison with the conference
                    and with the secretary's party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were sort of carrying messages back and forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes...and actually negotiating arrangements. You know, “If he gets an
                    armored car, I want an armored car. If they get an office with three rooms, we
                    want an office with three rooms.” And the politics of it—"Please don't say this
                    in your speech. We want everybody to get along at least well enough to get
                    through this so we can get the process going.” And advising the Jordanian prime
                    minister to shake hands with him—the Israeli—he didn't want to. This was not
                    going to make a very good photo op. In the end, they did shake hands for the
                    camera. It was very intense; it was about ten days, I think. There was a lot of
                    back and forth. The delegations were in hotels, and we were in another hotel,
                    and shuttling back and forth; and then setting up the venues, which were in a
                    palace—a Spanish palace. Getting the delegations settled in, getting the
                    Palestinians to talk to the Jordanians. I had, I think, a real advantage there
                    in that I had known, in my previous incarnation, about three quarters of the
                    Palestinian delegation personally, so that helped a great deal. That all worked
                    out, and in fact you can see in retrospect that we didn't get the deal we
                    wanted, but it actually did lead to the Israeli-Jordanian agreement. And then
                    the work afterwards on setting up all those interlocking committees that we
                    had....you've probably had somebody describe all of this before, so I don't need
                    to go over that ground. We had the joint committees for water and natural
                    resources and refugees and economic development, and, I don't know—there were a
                    lot of them. And the idea there was just to keep everybody talking to each other
                    constantly—at various levels, technical levels, official levels.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find both sides—Israeli and Jordanian
                        sides—wanting to get into, I mean, were they on board with the idea, you
                        know, that the more we get together, the better, the easier things will work

                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. It was important to them to reach an agreement on things like water
                    and right of return and trade and all the modalities of what peace would really
                    look like. So that really also was a major undertaking and took a lot of
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought the right of return would have been a
                        real sticking point, because to my mind, it's just not going to happen,
                        really, except in isolated incidents, the same way that probably the
                        settlement issue...You're really going to have a settlement— if they don't
                        return the settlements with some exception, maybe, they're not going to be
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I think that's right. We need to find...Really that's what we've tried to
                    do for years, find some face saving answer where both sides can claim victory
                    and not a whole lot happens...probably involving some payments to the people who
                    aren't getting back.</p>
                <p>I should also mention the Multinational Interdiction Force or MIF. This naval
                    force was put together to enforce the sanctions on Iraq during and after the
                    war. After Jordan began cooperating with us again, the virtual embargo of Aqaba,
                    Jordan's only port, became a major irritant. I worked for many months with the
                    Chief of the Royal Court, Marwan Kassim, to work out an agreement whereby Lloyds
                    of London would have a team in Aqaba inspecting all cargo and certifying that it
                    met the terms of the embargo.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Los Alamos! Why Los Alamos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, it seemed to be the only job available. They had one position out
                    there in return for which the Department of Energy got a science attach� slot in
                    London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were sort of a political observer at Los
                        Alamos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: They had something called the Center for National Security Studies—whose
                    major task was to advise the Lab director about major political developments
                    that could affect the Lab's mission, or atomic energy, or proliferation
                    issues.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Just for a year. '94-95.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 27th of February, 2007. We're up to 1994?
                        What were you up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I was out in Los Alamos on a one-year exchange program with the department
                    of energy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job at Los Alamos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, they had a Center for National Security Studies—a pretty small group
                    of people who were doing non-technical work, alerting the lab director and his
                    hierarchy to non-proliferation developments or political developments that could
                    affect the Lab, or perform studies in non-proliferation and foreign policy
                    angles of their work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find people paid much attention to you, or were
                        you a bit a fish out of water?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, I don't think we were mainstream, because it's a place that was
                    populated by nuclear physicists and nuclear chemists and doing scientific,
                    technical work. But, as I said, they paid attention, because they would
                    send—sometimes, at least— representatives to international negotiations to
                    supply the specific scientific knowledge that you might need and some of those
                    things. They understood that the politics of it all played a role and that it
                    was useful to stay informed with what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is of course the period that the Soviet Union
                        had sort of collapsed, and in a way it was sort of a...well, it was a pretty
                        positive period, wasn't it? I mean, both sides were looking for disarmament
                        and trying to take down a lot of the Cold War apparatus as far as
                        nuclear...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Right—in fact, the Lab set up a whole separate organization to deal with
                    that and it frequently traveled to the Soviet Union to help in safeguarding the
                    nuclear material and drawing up protocols for recovering it and taking some to
                    the States to reprocess, actually, and dispose of. In fact, that finally led to
                    the demise of the Center for National Security Studies, because they took all of
                    our budget, finally, and put it into this other—I forget the name of it—but it
                    was a group which was leading the charge for cooperation with the Russian
                    nuclear program.</p>

                    <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have Soviet counterparts—by this time they would
                        be Russian counterparts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: That group did; I didn't. And they went over there frequently; they
                    visited Soviet nuclear facilities, the Soviet counterpart to the Lab, like Los
                    Alamos. That was still the active program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you were there for a year. Then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. Only about ten months after they got rid of the Center. And I came
                    back to Washington after trying and failing to find another overseas job, and
                    ended up in the historian's office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in the historian's office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: The better part of five years. A long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I compiled a volume entitled The Intelligence Community: 1950-1960. There
                    had been an earlier volume from 1945 to 1950. I did a lot of work on that in
                    conjunction with the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) and some of the other—DIA
                    (Defense Intelligence Agency) and a few of the other intelligence agencies—INR
                    (Bureau of Intelligence and Research). Had the blessing of the CIA historian,
                    and now—I don't know what it is...five years later—it still hasn't been
                    published. Still in clearance. And I've been told it was broken into two volumes
                    now; they thought they might be able to get away with five years now and five
                    years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that this would have been almost a
                        non-starter, I mean, particularly with the CIA and all not wanting to
                        divulge anything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, that turned out to be the case, but the historian's office has a
                    committee that advises it and they pushed rather hard for more disclosure of the
                    role of intelligence in foreign policy, and it did seem like it was possible
                    because it was, like, 40 years ago and not too much of that stuff is still
                    supposed to be classified. But it proved very difficult to get the
                    clearance.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for...particularly that
                        period...well, particularly the CIA was still working with people who are
                        used to dealing with...who had been in World War II, and this is a very
                        operative thing. I mean these are guys who during the world war would get
                        the jeeps and go out and blow up things and do stuff. They hadn't really
                        been completely housebroken as far as dealing with the niceties of the
                        peacetime. I mean, did you find some of those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, there was a good deal of it buried in some of the files. I remember
                    one: It was discovered in FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) files, where
                    despite the internment of all the Japanese in World War II, they were now
                    planning to intern a whole bunch of people again during the Cold War. There were
                    all kinds of those things, and it was a transition period. In the early part of
                    it, particularly, there were a lot of the OSS (Office of Strategic Services)
                    veterans in the Agency; some crazy stuff was thought of—not necessarily carried
                    out. Most of that era was the Eisenhower era, and he had a fairly disciplined
                    system of staffing everything out and making sure that lots of the appropriate
                    people looked at things before they happened. Of course, we had the U-2 (spy
                    plane), but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had the U-2 and actually set up the Bay of Pigs, too. I
                        still saw something just the other day about the Guatemala ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, that's in there, too—that period. Ironic, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Archibald Roosevelt and all that sort of thing.
                        Everybody's written about that, but... Out of this, did you get any
                        feel...was there a pretty good system of sharing intelligence, or were the
                        major intelligence elements—the CIA, the FBI, Defense Intelligence
                        Agency—and INR, were they all kind of, sort of operating very much
                        separately, and was there much coordination at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I thought they operating quite separately. In fact, it was even before
                    DIA; at that time, each service had its own intelligence arm in the 50s. Later
                    on you got DIA. Each service had their own intelligence service, the FBI and CIA
                    were in constant turf battles. At the time, when this started, the FBI had
                    responsibility for Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then during World War II they were all over Latin America;
                        they had been handed that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, and it took quite a bit to get them out. No, I didn't feel that there
                    was great coordination. It was just the very beginning of the idea of an
                    intelligence community, and that was sort of shaped and formed as time went
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find that in your work in putting this
                        together, not getting maybe the final clearance, did you feel you got on
                        fairly well with the other organizations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, yes. We had a very good working relationship with the CIA historian's
                    office. DIA was pretty cooperative; INR was, of course. FBI not so much, but
                    they didn't have all that much. Touched base with pretty much everybody by the
                    time I finished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you did this for five years—takes you up to about
                        2000.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. I should add that during that period I went up to the UN (United
                    Nations) General Assembly for those five years, too, for three months each
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What piece of the action did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I was a senior advisor for Middle Eastern issues to the delegation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues during those five years that we were
                        particularly interested in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: It was not exclusively, but the vast majority of the issues were
                    Israeli-Palestinian. So we had to do a lot of work with the Palestinian
                    delegation and the Israeli delegation, and the EU (European Union) played a
                    fairly important role up there because they could probably count on 50 votes on
                    any given issue. But it tended to be pretty much the same resolutions year after
                    year. After you got used to them, you could do them in your sleep. But the
                    interaction made it an interesting experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of—let's take some of those
                        delegations—the Israeli delegation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: It varied. Their ambassador was usually a political appointee, and if he
                    was Likud, you got a very hard line, uncompromising reaction. If he was Labor,
                    you got a much more cooperative, get-along-with-my-colleagues type of reaction.
                    But they'd still vote against what they viewed as anti-Israeli resolutions, but
                    the atmosphere could change quite a bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you feel that Israelis...did you feel any within
                        the United States domestic pressures to keep us in line?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>KEENE: Oh, yes, and they did. Just the General Assembly's agenda hadn't changed
                    much in probably 20 years, so that was something that everybody had gotten
                    accustomed to. Yes, but some of the ambassadors couldn't spend a lot of time at
                    the UN; they were around giving speeches or testimony. Under the political
                    appointee, they had a very professional staff of diplomats who knew exactly what
                    they were doing. It was a pleasure to work with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Palestinian delegation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Interesting. They had—it was small—maybe four or five people, and only two
                    ever seemed to say a word or do anything: the ambassador, who was the political
                    appointee—he's now the foreign minister, or he was. He was related to
                    Arafat—some obscure brother-in-law kind of way, and the number two guy, who was
                    really sharp as a tack and knew exactly his way around at the UN, knew all the
                    issues; affable, got along with everybody—very effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a feel for Arafat's rule, because I think
                        everybody who, on the American side, has come up trying to deal with the
                        Israeli-Palestinian thing sort of despaired because of Arafat, who they
                        thought was really a problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. Well I later met him two or three times, actually. Not there; in
                    those days we weren't talking to him. Yes, he was a strange man—very hard to
                    understand and figure out. Work all night, sleep all day. At the UN it was even
                    more weird because Farouk Kaddoumi—Arafat had to buy him off, I guess, he had
                    given him responsibility for what went on at the UN, and he was a real
                    hard-liner, so it made it even more complicated. You could talk to people like,
                    later on—no, earlier—I had talked to people in the Palestinian Embassy in
                    Jordan, and they would tell you “I'm a Kaddoumi man; and he's an Arafat man.
                    They had these factions—PFLP and DFLP and this and that and the other thing. It
                    was a complex organization, and it wasn't very efficient politically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see...I mean, at the time, you were doing this up
                        until 2000, did you see light at the end of the tunnel or anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, I've spent a lot of time in Cairo, Jerusalem, Amman, working on this
                    issue, and I always have thought it's solvable, but it takes—and I think we all
                    know what the outcome ought to be—what it ought to look like. And I think that's
                    been clear for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, my understanding is, and I've heard it again and
                        again, no real return in what is now Israel, and the settlements essentially
                        will have to go, except for a few. And that's what it is, isn't it? And the
                        '67 boundaries.</hi>

                <p>KEENE: Yes. Accommodations have to be made; you'll have to create some illusions.
                    You'll have to give some money to those refugees who don't come back. You'll
                    have to have a capital, maybe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the other Arab delegations that
                        essentially they rather like to have the Arab-Israeli issue around, because
                        it seems to be the one thing that bound the Arab nations together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, I think there was some of that, and a lot of cynicism—it's been
                    around so long—and a lot of dislike among some of them for the Palestinians. The
                    amount of involvement by the delegations varied greatly, some doing almost
                    nothing except go to cocktail parties, some being very professional. The
                    Egyptians, as usual, had a good diplomatic service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Jordanians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: They were good, too, up there, at the UN. The ambassador became a good
                    friend of mine; he was a professional, life-long diplomat. He was very good. And
                    then they put a prince up there as the number two; I guess they were training
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Syria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Very negative. We could deal with them, and we did; we met with them every
                    session, frequently, but they were always very negative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Saudi Arabia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Not very central to the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Iran in the business at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. They had a delegation there. They worried more about their own
                    problems. It was the Iran-Iraq war time, and we weren't really talking to them;
                    we had broken relations with them. We used the UN as a venue to talk to them
                    when we wanted to, as we did with the North Koreans. It had its uses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did India and Pakistan, both with significant Muslim
                        populations, did they play any role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>KEENE: Not so much. They also focused on their own conflict—more the
                    sub-continent than the Middle East. Both pretty strong delegations, pretty
                    active delegations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the European Union. Were there any
                        particularly significant players among the European Union members?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Whoever the president was at the time. He usually would take the lead
                    role—that's the way that group seemed to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The president of the EU?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. Whichever country had the presidency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Every six months.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, right. But there were strong delegations within it: the UK is very
                    strong, Germany is stronger than you might think, not being one of the permanent
                    five. The French were not. When things were going all right, it did; it improved
                    the atmosphere. We never kidded ourselves that passing these resolutions was
                    really going to affect anything very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the UN—both the apparatus, the
                        people there, and also its effectiveness on this problem that's been around
                        for 60 years or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, on the major political issues of the day, I don't think it's very
                    effective. I think many of its technical agencies play a very important role in
                    making the world work: postage, and aircraft, and all of those things that they
                    do—the health. But politically, no, and at best the General Assembly has no
                    power; all the power is in the Security Council. Sometimes that can work, but
                    it's hard building the consensus to get things through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in 2000, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I went to the Press Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the spokesperson?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>KEENE: Richard Boucher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Basically just a run-of-the-mill job, getting him prepared for the
                    briefings, checking the wires (news services), writing the guidance, getting the
                    guidance cleared, answering press queries; kind of routine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you doing that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Until I retired, about two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, was there a change when the Bush Two
                        administration came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, they kept Boucher on, so we didn't...I mean, it was a change. We
                    were a little surprised that they didn't change the spokesman, but they
                    didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel...was there was a change in atmosphere, or
                        anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, we had Powell. We all liked Powell. I think he insulated us a little
                    bit. He was a reasonable guy to deal with; Boucher seemed to get along well with
                    him, so things in the Press Office went along pretty well. I mean, there were
                    major changes, obviously; the buildup to Iraq Two and all of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did sort of the 9/1l—the attack on the World
                        Trade Center—how did that affect you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I was sitting in the Press Office watching the TV when that happened. One
                    thing about the Press Office is you've always got a TV turned to the news
                    channel, where the TV is on all the time. Did that affect the Press Office? No,
                    I don't think it did a lot; you know, it was a busy period, we did a lot of
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure you did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: A lot of overtime. It was a pretty good office, as offices go; it was
                    pretty collegial, and a lot of people had been there a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you come away with any impression of the State
                        Department press corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, and it wasn't all that favorable, either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what respect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, they just didn't seem to be as well informed as people who cover
                    foreign policy ought to be—particularly those who had been doing it for a while.
                    There were some good ones, and some not so good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can always remember, during the Gulf One, the scene when
                        somebody in the Pentagon, asked “What does the president of Jordan think of
                        this?” And I thought, Oh, my God.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: There you go. There was a corps of regulars and I knew people would sort
                    of come every now and then, and there were a couple, we got a couple, of the
                    right-wing zealots who finally started showing up. They were just sort of out to
                    get the Department, to catch us in mistakes. One of them wrote a book; he was
                    just too much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the foreign press corps? Did you get any feel
                        for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, some of them would occasionally show up; like we had a guy from
                    Greece, and he would come and he would ask his one question about Greece, and
                    then he'd leave. There were a few foreign journalists who came, but not too
                    many. You probably know we have a Foreign Press Center, too, which was run by
                    USIA; now it's run by the Department, in a different building, and more of
                    them...I did a few weeks TDY over there. So they hung out over there more than
                    they would come to the main briefing center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it the usual mixed bag?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes. Some of them, pretty professional, had been covering the States maybe
                    three or four years; they knew a lot. Some of them, you wondered, maybe they had
                    been picked up as free lance—didn't seem to be that involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you retired in 2002. What was the feeling that
                        you came away with at that time about the rationale and how we were
                        presenting going to war with Iraq?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>KEENE: Very negative. It just seemed to me at the time, as it does now, that they
                    in the leadership there—the President, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Feith, Wolfowitz, all
                    of that crew, had just decided that they were going to go to war, and the facts
                    weren't going to get in the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this reflected by others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Yes, it was fairly widespread. And it was not going to work out very well;
                    they didn't seem to understand the potential for civil war, the Kurds, the
                    Shias, the Sunnis, and that they were told and just chose to ignore it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had been a Near Eastern hand and seen this...what was
                        your impression of Iraq at the time, and you might say, the
                        Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld-Wolfowitz crowd—I guess Rice was in there too—were
                        presenting, we'd go in and be met with flags and all...what were you hearing
                        from your fellow officers and that you felt yourself from what you'd
                        observed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: I was thinking that it was totally unnecessary, that Iraq was not a
                    threat, that it could easily be contained, as it had been, for many long years;
                    that it would be destabilizing to the Middle East, and that we were going to
                    have a lot harder time. I think a lot of people knew that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you retired in 2002, what have you been up
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: Well, I did another six months on contract with the Press Office, and then
                    I started spending more time in Maine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where in Maine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KEENE: A place called Ocean Park, Maine—southern Maine—a cottage that we bought
                    in the early 80s, thank God, because I couldn't afford it now. We go up there
                    now four or five months a year. Most of our family is in New England, so that's
                    convenient. And we've been traveling more, and reading more, and sleeping
                    later...and having a good time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great! Well, I want to thank you very much.</hi>
