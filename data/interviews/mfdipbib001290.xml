                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give us a little background on your early life?
                        Where and when you were born and your early education.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: I was born in northeastern South Dakota in the hamlet of Crocker. That
                    area was made famous by the distinguished professor from Wisconsin, Turner, with
                    his “last frontier” thesis. It was the last area where one hundred and sixty
                    acres of free land could be homesteaded profitably. My maternal grandfather,
                    from Norway, was one of the last of the original homesteaders in 1888. That is
                    also where my mother was born. I used to mention that she was born in a sod hut,
                    but when she heard me say that once she said indignantly that I was entirely
                    wrong. Her older brothers were born in a sod hut but she insisted she was born
                    in a respectable frame house. She didn't realize that I was boasting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: 1920.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you get your early schooling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: I went to the Crocker school—Crocker was founded in 1910—for eight
                    years. It had two rooms so I couldn't even say that I had gone to a one room
                    school. We had no high school there; in fact we had no electricity or running
                    water. The town was built when the railway came through and like most everything
                    else out in the high plains it expanded rapidly until the agricultural
                    depression of the twenties, the big depression hit in the thirties along with
                    the devastating drought. It was a very prosperous area to begin with and my
                    grandfather became quite a well to do farmer because there happened to be very
                    high prices for grain during World War I and some time before. Crocker was
                    founded in 1910 and it almost immediately started declining. It had three
                    saloons at one time, a newspaper, two banks, a dance hall, three general stores,
                    and five grain elevators. By the time I was growing up most were empty
                    buildings. This experience made me a life-long pessimist.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you didn't go to high school there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: No. There never was a high school. My older brother went to a school
                    eight miles away. I was delayed in getting to high school because I was sick a
                    year with rheumatic fever and then moved. My father was a railway agent and when
                    they closed the station at Crocker because there was no business he used his
                    seniority and chose to go to Iowa where it rained more often. He picked a place
                    that had a good high school for his children—five boys. That is how I ended up
                    in Corwith, Iowa from where I was appointed to the career service. I maintained
                    my residence there until my retirement in 1980 out of loyalty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is where you went to high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: That's right. From there I went to the University of Iowa in 1939. I
                    was followed at Iowa by my three younger brothers, all of whom received their
                    B.A.s and M.A.s there on the GI Bill as did my older brother at Berkeley. All my
                    graduate education was courtesy of Uncle Sam as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If that was in 1939 you must have been there when World
                        War II started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes, I was. The war in Europe started the day I left for college in
                    1939. I took advanced ROTC because I was certain we were going to be in the war.
                    I graduated a semester early in December 1942 because by that time we were
                    deeply into the war and I felt rather guilty about not being in it so I went to
                    summer school and entered the Army six months earlier than most of my
                    classmates. Eventually all five brothers were in the armed forces, three of whom
                    served overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you deferred because you were taking ROTC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes. We didn't get commissions but we were sent to Officer's Candidate
                    School in Fort Benning, Georgia beginning January 2 of 1943. I got through that
                    by hook or crook in April and became a second lieutenant in the infantry. I
                    would have much preferred a more pleasant way of life but I was precluded from
                    the glamour of aviation or of the navy because I was color blind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go after you got your commission?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WOODBURY: I was assigned to a newly organized division assembling in the
                    Willamette Valley in Oregon, the 70th Infantry. It is a beautiful place in the
                    summer but in the winter it is cold, foggy, and rainy most of the time but I
                    spent almost half my time there in the high desert of central Oregon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your duties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: I was an infantry platoon leader. I had almost every kind of platoon,
                    mortars, machine guns, then later rifles. The problems of trying to organize a
                    new division—they told us we had to be ready to fight the Germans or Japanese
                    within a year, which I thought was sheer madness because the average officer had
                    been in the army less than a year and the average non-com, of the few we had,
                    had been in less than six months. The rest were draftees or “fillers” as they
                    were called. It was absolute confusion. I remember trying to teach sixty men how
                    to infiltrate a heavy mortar platoon through woods or jungle on a parade ground
                    as flat and bare as this floor; the platoon sergeant and I were the only ones
                    who had ever seen a mortar. I didn't even have a picture of one to show the
                    draftees. I complained to one of my superiors about that and he said,
                    “Lieutenant, use your imagination, improvise.” So I then realized that the
                    United States Army was mad and you just had to go along with it. But as one of
                    my friends said, “We won the war didn't we.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there approximately a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: No, after six months I volunteered for overseas service. I was always
                    being detailed to temporary duty so I spent much time away and every time I came
                    back I had a different platoon. They used these training divisions as a source
                    of replacements. So I went to the Pacific, to Hawaii to a replacement depot with
                    five hundred first and second lieutenants. They had expected heavy casualties at
                    Kwajalein based on the Marines' experience on Tarawa. We had very few
                    casualties, however, because we had learned how to do it, so they took half the
                    surplus officers and sent them to MacArthur in New Guinea where they went
                    directly into the front lines. They went by the alphabet, A to K to MacArthur
                    and the second half stayed in Hawaii. I went to the Seventh Division on Oahu. It
                    had just returned from Kwajalein, so I had another six months of non-combat
                    infantry duty with the 17th Infantry which became my specialty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WOODBURY: I had a rifle platoon which had been in combat twice; a very relaxed
                    organization, a lot of good feeling. They had been together about three years.
                    Because they had miscalculated resulting in a surplus of lieutenants in the
                    central theater, we were up for grabs. They discovered that I had a college
                    degree, which was extremely rare among second lieutenants in those days. We were
                    establishing another logistics command in Hawaii to handle the Army operations
                    in the central Pacific under Admiral Nimitz—Nimitz had his own army just as
                    MacArthur had his own navy. So I became part of Nimitz's army. When I was
                    interviewed for the job I never thought I would get it because I was only
                    twenty-three years old and the only experience I had had outside of the army was
                    as foreman of a dishwashing crew at the University of Iowa hospital. My
                    competition was a lawyer who was thirty-two years old. I suppose I was more
                    trainable, for to my great surprise I was transferred there as a general staff
                    officer. I had to ask the only other second lieutenant there what a general
                    staff does. I'm still not sure.</p>
                <p>After another six months in the Central Pacific Base Command I volunteered again;
                    by that time I was a trained general staff officer in logistics; one learned
                    fast in those days. I had learned the different logistics systems for the army
                    and the navy because we were under overall navy command and the ground forces
                    were a mixture of marines and army, even the languages used were different. So
                    in January I went to the Tenth Army, which was to take Okinawa; because of my
                    understanding of our hybrid logistic system, however I never got to Okinawa
                    until the war was over. I stayed on Okinawa until the last of April, 1946—I
                    wasn't actually on Okinawa but was supply officer for the garrison force on Ie
                    Shimada where Ernie Pyle was killed. It was also the closest territory to Tokyo
                    that we had taken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were discharged in 1946 did you have plans to
                        further your education on the GI Bill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Oh yes but I resisted the idea. I was twenty-six when I was discharged
                    as a captain; I had been overseas for twenty-seven months and wanted to live the
                    good life for a while so I really resisted going back to school, I wasn't
                    anxious to return to the classroom and library but I found out that a bachelor's
                    degree in economics from the University of Iowa didn't open many doors for you
                    nor did amphibious logistics. I realized I had to go to graduate school. Of
                    course the GI Bill was a tremendous opportunity not to be missed. I decided I
                    would stay in economics.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>There was one major influence in Okinawa that I have left out. In the last
                    months, there was nothing to do. It was a miserable place, it was like living in
                    a charnel house; there were a quarter of a million people killed there in a
                    small area. There was nothing left but mines, shell holes and dust (or mud), and
                    about half a million Okinawans who had survived held in concentration camps. The
                    University of the Ryukyus was established for service men who wanted to expand
                    their education and I made several friends there on the faculty. One was a
                    middle-aged (over thirty) signal corps officer who was a Harvard graduate. He
                    suggested that I ought to apply to Harvard after I got back, and I did and was
                    accepted to my surprise. I spent a semester at the University of Chicago first
                    because I didn't hear from Harvard immediately. After two and a half years there
                    I passed my generals for the Ph.D. After four years absence from academic work,
                    it was a difficult and grinding effort but I took the time to court my wife
                    Elizabeth Delano, who was an undergraduate at Radcliffe. We were married in
                    Tokyo October 9, 1950.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you had a notion that you wanted to join the Foreign
                        Service long before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Not really, I just took advantage of an opportunity open to all to take
                    the FSO exam as a hedge. I intended to teach, to finish my Ph.D. dissertation
                    and become an assistant professor somewhere. But then I also found out that
                    economics had become very mathematical and I had limited mathematics, just
                    barely enough to get through. I had to teach myself differential calculus to
                    understand statistics and courses in theory. I realized I had to go back and
                    take several years of mathematics or be obsolete at the age of thirty. After I
                    passed the Foreign Service exam, I was called for the oral and passed that too
                    but I thought I could leave it open because it took about a year in those days
                    to get in after passing the exam. Unfortunately, I was called into the Foreign
                    Service just before December 1948 when I was due for my generals. I got a delay
                    because if I had gone in then I would have thrown away that two and a half years
                    of hard work. So they extended me for the next class which they thought would be
                    the next summer. So I started a Ph.D. dissertation just in case I changed my
                    mind again, and I was called up in June of 1949. After at least a decade in the
                    Foreign Service, I remembered the professor of European history had recommended
                    I apply for the Foreign Service because of my aptitude for history. It seemed so
                    farfetched, I immediately forgot to, but times changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in the Foreign Service class of 1949. What
                        could you tell us about the class, its composition, outlook, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: I think there were about twenty-five or so in the class. Only about
                    fourteen or fifteen were career Foreign Service officers.</p>

                <p>WOODBURY: There were four women who became Foreign Service officers, a record at
                    that time, only one survived the first assignment. The other three were married,
                    and they then had to resign. The survivor attained the rank of Ambassador four
                    times, and retired just recently—Patricia Byrne. One of the women, Lucille
                    McHenry, married a classmate, Cleo Noel, who was at Harvard with me. After his
                    tragic murder by PLO terrorists in the Sudan and her children were older, she
                    accepted reappointment in the FSO corps. The last time I saw Lucille, she was
                    sternly lecturing Under Secretary Habib that if he wanted his staff promoted, he
                    had to get their ERs in on time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other minorities in the class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Well, I always considered myself one being from the rural Midwest.
                    Maybe, Phil Habib; he was treated like a minority because he was Lebanese. It
                    was mostly a white, male group, probably Protestant. Most of the males and one
                    of the females were veterans so we were older than many, between twenty-five and
                    thirty-five. One of the women became a Danish countess—certainly a minority on
                    several counts. (No pun intended)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What training did your class receive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: In those days, before the cone system, junior officers were expected to
                    do consular work, so we got heavy training in that: visas, passports,
                    immigration, citizenship questions, etc. We had some economic training which
                    Phil Habib and I thought was pretty jejune. For creative writing we were told to
                    count the parts of speech and work toward the ideal proportions which I thought
                    a bit weird.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find this training, such as it was, of some help
                        to you in your career?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WOODBURY: Not really. I think there was a cultural and generational problem
                    there. First, we were older and most had had a lot of responsibility before. As
                    a platoon leader and a general staff officer, I probably had much more
                    responsibility in the Army than I did for my first years in the Foreign Service.
                    Phil Habib was a captain in the Army engineers building temporary airfields
                    right behind the lines in Europe; another member was a major in the Air Force in
                    charge of all the weather service in the Mediterranean; we had a decorated
                    artillery officer, the Silver Star, who was a forward observer in Europe and has
                    just published a book about it; a couple of Navy officers who had commanded
                    small ships. Many of us believed that we were talked down to by the lecturers
                    and especially by FSO's about our age who had spent World War II in such hot
                    spots as Costa Rica. There was also a certain generational conflict. I myself
                    thought after the first euphoria about being admitted to “the elite service”
                    wore off that the members of the examining board for the orals were stuffy,
                    naive, knew very little about the U.S. and showed a very remarkable cultural
                    bias for representatives abroad for all Americans. My classmate Phil Habib and I
                    agreed that the FSO in charge of economic training in FSI was a pompous ass
                    whose knowledge of the subject would not get him a passing grade in a good ECON
                    A undergraduate course.</p>
                <p>I knew our mentor my last year at Harvard and never saw him take a note or
                    participate in seminars. A dean at what is now called the Kennedy School told me
                    later that the Harvard faculty was seriously considering not accepting any more
                    FSO's for economic training because most of them did not have the academic
                    training to benefit from graduate work.</p>
                <p>I was amused that even after he had become an ambassador, Habib never forgot our
                    “advisor.” Phil had just been awarded his Ph.D. from California in economics
                    that summer. At a “seminar” about the current economy by our professor, Phil
                    took a mild and respectful (for Phil) exception to the politically current line
                    on economic policy only to be told that junior officers were to be seen and not
                    heard. When Phil was appointed Ambassador to Korea, I asked if he was going to
                    ask for this obscure officer as his Economic Counselor, he erupted violently
                    until he realized I was teasing him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you mean by cultural bias?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WOODBURY: It has been over a year since I gave this interview and I had to think
                    hard why I was so vehement because these biases such as still existed never had
                    an important impact on my career or personal relations. But we were talking
                    about 45 years ago, not now. The cultural bias was to white upper middle class;
                    east coast, good family, private university snobbishness. To put it bluntly,
                    many of us were rather unimpressed by the State Department and the “elitism”
                    claimed by the Foreign Service. There are many brilliant individuals and the
                    average is high for a government agency but that is largely irrelevant because
                    we have conceded to other agencies a lion's share of foreign policy. The country
                    team concept and the political ambassador patronage system puts an impossible
                    burden on the Foreign Service to excel and lead. As Napoleon said about the
                    British regiment to their front at Waterloo, “The best cavalry in Europe—and the
                    worst lead.”</p>
                <p>I realize that I have often mentioned Phil Habib in this interview, and I know
                    that one cannot speak for the dead. I believe he had died shortly before this
                    interview so a flood of memories of 45 years ago came back. He was my best
                    friend in our class and our paths kept crossing even after he became mythic. I
                    do think it useful to recall that before he was canonized, the way was not made
                    smooth for him nor was he welcomed into the exclusive club with open arms.</p>
                <p>I first met Phil when the class of 1949 met in July 1949. Our common interests
                    deepened into a long term friendship, in part because we thought a lot alike and
                    we shared fairly rough backgrounds—by Foreign Service standards only. In
                    comparing notes with Phil, I said I was irritated by my orals board when they
                    grilled me about my Norwegian grandparents and my South Dakota birthplace. I
                    never knew my grandmother, and my grandfather died when I was eight so neither
                    was a seminal influence in my life to my regret. I actually had little interest
                    in Norway until World War II.</p>
                <p>The chairman informed me later that despite some doubts about a Norwegian accent
                    some had heard they had passed me. Years later my “pronounced mid-Western
                    accent” was mentioned as a criticism in an ER so I suspect that is what the
                    board thought they heard. At that time I thought it grotesque because I could
                    not speak a word of Norwegian. And after all, we are a nation of immigrants. My
                    father's English speaking forebears landed on Cape Ann in New England in 1624,
                    while my Norwegian grandparents settled in Dakota Territory in 1880. What weight
                    did one give—plus or minus—to refugees from the Norwegian diaspora as compared
                    to refugees from English religious wars?</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>In relating his experience, Phil said I was lucky because I had vaguely blue eyes
                    and a respectable WASP name while he had an Arab/Jewish name with the map of the
                    Middle East on his face. His board had really worked him over about his origins
                    even questioning his command of Arabic. His chairman let him know that they had
                    reluctantly accepted him as the first Arab American FSO but he must understand
                    he could never serve in the Middle East. That vastly amused me when in the
                    1980's he shuffled between Tel Aviv and Damascus in trying to get the PLO out of
                    Lebanon. At the time he told me that he was the only American both Begin and
                    Assad would speak to. I'm sure Phil was not oblivious to the irony but he never
                    mentioned it to me again.</p>
                <p>Our experience with the oral boards in 1949 made me wonder just what was the
                    paradigm of a model American diplomat in those days. I asked a slightly younger
                    friend from Galesburg, Illinois at the last Foreign Service Day, about his
                    experience. He said his oral board must have made a close ethnic study of
                    Galesburg because they asked him if he identified with the Irish or Swedish
                    communities there. He had a bemused smile as if to say he hadn't figured out the
                    answer yet. Another classmate of mine and Phil's volunteered that his board
                    wondered how he had ever heard of the U.S. Foreign Service in Nebraska. He had
                    been an infantry platoon leader in combat in Europe and had spent most of the
                    interim in the graduate school of the University of Chicago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first assignment was Tokyo. Were you given any choice
                        in that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes, some choice. I was very much interested in the Marshall Plan in
                    Europe and I assumed that because I had so much training in that area the
                    Foreign Service would consider me for a position where I could use it. Incurably
                    naive! Hence, I put down Europe first, then Latin America because I thought
                    Spanish would be easier to learn and I am not a great linguist, and last Japan.
                    I had spent three years working to defeat the Japanese Empire, but I had never
                    gotten there (except Okinawa). Perhaps, because it was the only specific country
                    requested, I was assigned to Japan, something that I hadn't really thought much
                    about even though my war-time service was directed there.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>The occupation was still in force and was the entire time I was there. If I had
                    thought about that, I probably wouldn't have gone. I had already served under
                    General MacArthur as a soldier. They had the Office of the Political Advisor
                    from State, but MacArthur wouldn't allow it to be called that; he called it the
                    Diplomatic Section of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, his Foreign
                    Office so to speak. He wasn't about to take advice from anybody, especially the
                    State Department. There was really no role for us to play except for the
                    consulates doing consular work and routine liaison with foreign missions. I
                    helped eight hundred G.I.'s marry Japanese girls, and then I issued two thousand
                    visas to Japanese wives and their children after I went down to Yokohama. SCAP
                    was very upset by the thought that we might be doing any political or economic
                    reporting not under their control. Our role as the nucleus of the future U.S.
                    Embassy was especially troubling as a threat to their pleasant life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was no embassy there because it was under
                        occupation and you just had the consular functions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: It wasn't quite like that. In Europe, you may recall, the State
                    Department ended up running Germany. So far as I know this worked relatively
                    smoothly as the military was glad to give up the political functions. But not
                    MacArthur, it was his world out there; he was the blue-eyed Shogun. So after a
                    year in Tokyo, I asked to go to Yokohama. There I did consular work only, a sort
                    of hazing process to teach us humility. It was interesting applying the 1940
                    immigration act to Japan. It didn't go into effect until January 1, 1942, just
                    after Pearl Harbor. There were many questions of comparative law because the
                    Japanese had no nationality law per se; the Japanese are Japanese are Japanese
                    and everyone knows they are Japanese. There was no requirement, for example,
                    that you had to be a Japanese citizen to be Emperor or Prime Minister. According
                    to United States law, if you had dual citizenship and accepted a job of trust
                    where you had to take an oath of allegiance to a foreign government, you were
                    expatriated. Such a concept was completely unknown to the Japanese, one race,
                    one people, one nation, and one language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we just get your dates straightened out. You went to
                        Tokyo in 1949?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Late 1949, just in time for Thanksgiving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You stayed in Tokyo about a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes. Then I went to Yokohama at my request because I wanted to get
                    married and they didn't have housing in Tokyo but they did in Yokohama.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>I took the job of a language officer who was going up to the consulate in
                    Hokkaido. I took over his job, his house and his staff of five servants who were
                    furnished us by the Army. Incidentally, he was a Harvard law graduate and his
                    legal training was put to good use. He did some very complex work in comparative
                    law on nationality questions while he was a very junior officer, a third
                    secretary and a vice-consul (Richard B. Finn), relating to the initial
                    application of 1940 U.S. Immigration Act. His daughter also graduated from
                    Harvard Law 40 years later and he was wryly amused that her entry salary was
                    higher than his FSO-1 final salary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Japan at that time? It was still
                        under the occupation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Just a week after we left in April 1952, the occupation ended
                    officially. When I arrived there in 1949 Japan was still devastated; Yokohama
                    was almost destroyed, about 25% of the people in Japan had active TB, there was
                    general malnutrition. But then in June 1950, the Korean war started. I was up in
                    Hokkaido when I heard about that, sitting in a hot bath in a country inn. Our
                    Japanese interpreter, a graduate of Northwestern and a Presbyterian minister,
                    stopped talking to us for a while and listened to the Japanese bathers. He told
                    us they were excited because a war had started in Korea. We were far out in the
                    mountains and forests of this largely wild island. He said that the Japanese
                    reported that the North Koreans had attacked and asked if that could be true? I
                    said, “I am sure that is a wild rumor.” It took us three days to get back to
                    Sapporo where we found out that yes, it was true. That changed a lot of things;
                    the Japanese became a valued resource because they had the industrial manpower.
                    They were often used illegally; they not only built the minesweepers, but they
                    manned them in Korean ports which was contrary to the treaty. That was the
                    beginning of the Japanese prosperity, which was also helped greatly by the war
                    in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If there was no embassy that you were responsible to, who
                        was your superior?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: The U.S. Political Advisor, (U.S. POLAD) was its formal designation.
                    Bill Sebald was POLAD with the rank of ambassador. He had been a naval officer
                    before the war, a Japanese language officer, and he had made the mistake of
                    marrying a woman who was half Japanese—her father was English. The navy was
                    incredibly racist in those days so he was forced to resign. He got a law degree
                    and went into partnership with his father-in-law a well-known lawyer just in
                    time for the war. He went back into the navy then and came into the Foreign
                    Service after the war because of his linguistic abilities. He started as the
                    deputy U.S. POLAD. A very experienced senior Foreign Service officer, was U.S.
                    POLAD initially. Apparently, he was one of the few FSOs that MacArthur liked or
                    trusted so he had considerable influence. He disappeared when his plane was lost
                    flying back to Japan from Hawaii. We never learned what happened to him.
                    MacArthur used that opportunity to say that Sebald was perfectly satisfactory—a
                    nonentity with no diplomatic experience. Whatever influence State Department had
                    on policy pretty much went out the window.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the man's name who disappeared?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Atcheson, I believe; not quite Acheson. I never knew him. Sebald went
                    on to other ambassadorships and to be assistant secretary for East Asia; he was
                    a competent man, but not somebody who could stand up to MacArthur. Most
                    occupation officials thought it would have to go on for a hundred years to teach
                    the Japanese democracy and how to run trains and build ships. When people told
                    me this I couldn't believe it. I don't have many kind words for General
                    MacArthur but in many ways he was a great statesman. I thought Forrestal summed
                    it up brilliantly in his diary when he first met MacArthur in the
                    Philippines—”Enormous ability mortgaged to his vanity.” That covers it, both the
                    plus and the minus. He insisted that despite the Korean war the occupation
                    should end as scheduled because no one ever taught a country self-government
                    under military rule (especially under a man as authoritarian as he was). He was
                    absolutely right; he went ahead and got Truman to appoint John Foster Dulles to
                    get the support of the Republicans, the Dewey-Rockefeller Republicans, which
                    would be enough to get the treaty through the Senate. Dulles did great work on
                    that, he had the prestige. MacArthur, always a partisan Republican, let it be
                    known in 1948 that he would gladly take over and clean up the mess in Washington
                    but even more openly in 1952, an unusual situation to put it mildly, shades of
                    General McClellan!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The peace treaty was being negotiated while you were there
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Dulles came out when I was still in Tokyo. George Kennan was there too.
                    He had a famous comment which I don't think he ever put in any of his books. Any
                    official who came to Tokyo would be briefed by MacArthur's staff about how
                    everything was coming up roses. This went on for two days. Kennan was asked his
                    view of the situation in Japan after his briefing and he said, “It all began to
                    blur one chart after another; all I remember is that all the statistics and
                    charts were going up and up and up, except that of the venereal disease rate of
                    U.S. troops was going down and down and down.”</p>
                <p>The occupation of Japan was a great success, I think largely due to the Japanese.
                    They were horrible in war but they were wonderful in the occupation because when
                    they change, they can change absolutely. As far as I know, there was never an
                    attack on an American soldier, even in the earliest days when they went ashore
                    with their weapons loaded and cocked. MacArthur landed at Atsugi airfield and
                    went to the Grand Hotel in Yokohama which fortunately had not been hit by
                    American bombs—neither had the nearby American consulate. He had a food taster
                    there just in case. That suspicion lasted only a few days and within a week
                    Americans were wandering alone all over that huge city.</p>

                        nature—consular work—give you a different insight into Japan? Did you have
                        more contact with the Japanese people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes, but only for business. It must be remembered that
                    non-fraternization orders were in effect until MacArthur left Japan, long after
                    they had been lifted in Germany. There was a constant stream of people with
                    everyday problems especially when our soldiers were given permission to marry
                    Japanese nationals. In a way it was more interesting. As a trained economist,
                    though, I worried I was wasting my time.</p>
                <p>I was first assigned in Japan to handle natural resources; the economic counselor
                    there, my boss, came from the Commerce Department and he addressed mainly
                    routine commercial work. He sent the press releases of SCAP to Washington
                    without comment or analysis. He had only one other officer working for him who
                    did the trade negotiations; Japan could not trade or deal directly with other
                    countries so SCAP had to do it for them and they needed a diplomatic officer for
                    that. His staff doubled when I came on board, but he didn't know what to do with
                    me. So I didn't have much of anything to do for about six weeks. He promised to
                    take me over to the Natural Resources Section of SCAP because that had not been
                    covered at all; it had agriculture, fisheries, forestry and mining—none of which
                    were top boiler issues. My boss was so busy sending in his press releases he
                    never got around to take me over so for six weeks I read everything; it is
                    amazing what comes over your desk. I was learning a lot, but I didn't see much
                    point to it so I kept after him. Finally he said, “I'm just too busy, why don't
                    you go over and introduce yourself to Colonel Schenk,” who was head of the
                    section.</p>
                <p>Of MacArthur's section chiefs Colonel Schenk was the junior man, the only one who
                    was a colonel, the rest were all major generals—and not entirely by coincidence
                    he was the only one who had any qualifications for the job. So I went over to
                    see Colonel Schenk who had been a professor of geography at Stanford. He was
                    pleased that U.S. POLAD, the future U.S. embassy was interested enough to assign
                    an officer to his section. He invited me to his staff meetings and briefing, and
                    I won his heart at a meeting in which Colonel Schenk was explaining the basis
                    for the land reform in Japan. A newly arrived colonel said he thought this was a
                    terrible thing, pure socialism. In Nebraska if you worked hard you could
                    homestead and then acquire more land than others as his grandfather had done. It
                    was a matter of hard work and that is the way it should be in Japan. There was
                    and is no question in my mind that Japan has (or had up to now) a conservative
                    pro-American government because of the land reform; it was the foundation of
                    parliamentary government because people had a vested interest in the system. I
                    told the colonel that my grandfather had been a homesteader in South Dakota as
                    his grandfather had been in Nebraska but that the situation in Japan was
                    entirely different and explained why. When they left Colonel Schenk said he was
                    most grateful, “You explained it perfectly but I couldn't say that.” So because
                    of that incident, I became a friend. Fortunately, civilians do not wear rank on
                    their business suits so the good colonel did not realize I was a lowly third
                    secretary.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Colonel Schenk later asked me if I could help get a SCAP population report
                    released. Professor Ackerman of Harvard had come out to Japan to study Japan's
                    scarce resources in relation to its population problem. His report stated that
                    for the economy to be viable, there would have to be population control but he
                    made no recommendation as to means. There was a great fuss over that comment
                    because MacArthur had refused to let the public health officer introduce any
                    family planning in Japan—he was running for president and didn't want that issue
                    raised—so the whole report was ordered sequestered, fifteen hundred copies of
                    it. I wrote a report to Washington and there was some pressure from there so
                    they finally let the report out but they took out the addendum that contained
                    the reference to population. I got a copy of the original report and reproduced
                    that section for the Department. This would be just a mildly amusing story of
                    military heavy-handedness except for one thing; when the Japanese finally did
                    begin to control their population, to catch up with the lost years they had to
                    resort to abortion, free and unlimited abortion; they had no experience nor
                    training in family planning at the end of the occupation. The Japanese
                    government is always embarrassed by this in international meetings.</p>
                <p>It shows, at least, how much influence a third secretary can have or can't have.
                    It took me weeks to get that report out of the office because my boss knew it
                    was a hot potato so he just kept it in his in box. Finally he went on home leave
                    and his temporary replacement came to me with my report and said, “Let's get it
                    out, he isn't going to be back for two months.” So it went up to the DCM and I
                    got called up to see him, a starchy gentleman out of the old Foreign Service. “I
                    understand you wrote this and from your conclusion I understand you to believe
                    that censorship has been improperly used to keep this report from being
                    released.” I thought I was in for it but managed to say, “Yes sir, that is the
                    conclusion that I draw.” He smiled suddenly, a rare event, and said, “Well you
                    are right, but you have got to write it more clearly so that people will
                    understand it.” That was one of my best days. So I polished it up and it went
                    out but by this time it was too late to have had much influence. Once MacArthur
                    made his opinions known it was like an encyclical from the Pope. At least the
                    Pope admits that he is a man, MacArthur never did.</p>

                        That was quite a change, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: It certainly was; that is the way they keep you off balance, I
                    guess.</p>

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WOODBURY: I might add here that I liked Japan; the occupation was coming to an
                    end. It ended two days after I left with massive riots. I told my wife that
                    “when I leave everything goes to hell.” Imagine having the occupation end on May
                    Day, when all the communists were out with their red flags! It is a holiday in
                    Japan. Only we Americans could have picked that time instead of a week later or
                    a week earlier. It was just a “blip” it turned out, but at the time we were
                    scared to death. The last thing in the world we wanted was to use U.S. troops to
                    reassert control; the Japanese police maintained control and Japan was a
                    sovereign nation again. Because I went back to Japan later I thought I had
                    better add here that I was urged to take Japanese language specialization, but
                    at thirty-two and having spent all my adult life either in the military or in
                    graduate school I just didn't want to go back to school again for two years.
                    Training in Japanese would have worked well with my economics it turned out. So
                    to the Dominican Republic.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: August 1952. I had home leave first—I had married in Tokyo, Lee came
                    out there in October 1950. We had a time getting her into Japan because of the
                    Korean War; it was hard in any case to get a permit for her to come to Japan to
                    visit a single man. She got to Japan before the worst happened in Korea; for a
                    while after the Chinese came in we were not sure we could hold south Korea and
                    they talked of evacuating the dependents from Japan. They shortly stopped that
                    talk because it was logistically impossible and they didn't want to start a
                    panic.End tape 1, begin tape 2.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: From November of 1949 until the end of April of 1952. Then after home

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went as an economic officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes. There were three officers in the economic section and I was the
                    junior officer. I found out, for all my economic training, that I was in charge
                    of routine commercial work, world trade directory reports, trade lists, and that
                    my chief was certifiably mad. It was really the nadir of my experience. The
                    Dominican Republic was a vicious dictatorship. It was less vicious than it had
                    been because, as a Puerto Rican friend told me, all the people with any guts
                    were either dead or in exile. It was a very efficient totalitarian regime, in
                    every sense of the word; probably worse than Nazi Germany except in scale.
                    Germany was a large country and they couldn't keep track of everybody, but the
                    Dominican Republic had only three and a half or four million people at the time
                    of whom only ten to twenty percent were the literate middle class; the rest were
                    campesinos, so everybody who counted knew each other. They were afraid even to
                    think, for fear of letting it show on their faces. Trujillo was a megalomaniac,
                    efficient and with enormous energy. He was not the typical “caudillo,” he was
                    much more able. Most military dictators enrich their family and they are
                    satisfied to leave with their loot.</p>
                <p>Trujillo put his younger brother Hector in as President while he took the
                    honorary title as Benefactor de la Patria, but he still ran everything. At the
                    inauguration for Hector, there was a five day celebration, but the only head of
                    state that they got to come was Anastasio Somoza of Nicaragua. At one of the
                    ceremonies, I saw a jaunty, middle-aged man surrounded by people and having a
                    good time telling stories. It seemed so “un Dominican” that I asked my Puerto
                    Rican friend who that was. “Oh, don't you know him? That is Somoza.” He was in a
                    business suit, telling jokes and laughing. A few minutes later Trujillo came in
                    in his Admiral's uniform with medals and gold all over and with his fore and aft
                    hat with plumes. Everyone fell absolutely silent. He was announced and walked in
                    as the band struck up. I tell this story because on the way home Somoza stopped
                    in (pre Castro) Cuba to tell the American Ambassador, “You have got to watch
                    that man, he is a madman.” That was the difference between Somoza who was the
                    conventional caudillo, corrupt and authoritarian, but with a sense of reality
                    that Trujillo had completely lost.</p>
                <p>Trujillo told one of the American ambassadors there, it may have been Ellis
                    Briggs who loathed him, that, “It was a pity I was born in such a small country,
                    I could have done so much for your country.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: We had two. The first a wealthy political appointee from New York named
                    Phelps Phelps (really). When the Eisenhower Administration took over from
                    Truman, William Tecumseh—not Sherman but Pheiffer was named. He came from
                    Oklahoma and was called “Wild Bill,” but he was actually a New York corporate
                    lawyer and sometime politician.</p>

                <p>WOODBURY: Well, he was basically senile. A strange old bachelor to whom Senator
                    Lehman owed something or other. He was very naive and unknowledgeable. His whole
                    policy was to apologize for the United States being the colossus of the north.
                    He was an absolute zero which made it difficult for us to deal with a dictator
                    who was extremely aggressive, shrewd and energetic. Pheiffer was an intelligent
                    and amiable fellow who knew nothing about diplomacy and cared less. He let the
                    DCM pretty much run the embassy but he backed us up (at least at first).
                    Unfortunately, after I left, he got involved on the wrong side of the Galendez
                    case—the man whom Trujillo had kidnapped from Columbia University and murdered
                    because he wrote an unflattering book about his regime. In covering it up
                    Trujillo's minions also had to murder the kidnappers, two pilots one of whom was
                    American and one Dominican. It was fully reported in Life Magazine and I believe
                    the document published on U.S. foreign affairs for those years. Pheiffer, a
                    former congressman from Manhattan thought himself a man of the world and
                    Dominican politics was like the Republicans and Democrats back home. He could
                    not accept that his friends were murderous thugs.</p>

                <p>WOODBURY: Outside of the fact that we didn't like to have Americans murdered?
                    There was another American citizen murdered earlier, an Episcopal priest who had
                    reported about the massacre of the Haitians in 1937; 13,000 sugar cane workers
                    were killed on orders from Trujillo. The priest made the mistake of writing to
                    his sister about it through the open mail. He was buried in front of the alter
                    and on Memorial Day I would have that in mind watching Trujillo's deputy, who is
                    believed to have ordered him murdered sit in full dress uniform between the
                    American and UK ambassadors, in the Anglican church in the capital.</p>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>WOODBURY: Sugar, sugar, sugar. The Dominican Republic had a very small sugar
                    quota—Cuba pre-Castro had a huge one—and that made an enormous difference in the
                    price they got for their sugar. The other two main exports were cacao and coffee
                    but they were minor compared to sugar. Our main concern was the treatment of
                    American investment; the two largest sugar centrals; United Fruit's northernmost
                    banana plantation; the telephone and power companies, the major petroleum
                    companies were all American owned. Trujillo would harass them all intermittently
                    to shake them down or try to buy them on the cheap. Johnson believed it was a
                    substitute for Haiti. Trujillo was afraid we would not sit still for that.</p>
                <p>I started out as the third man in the economic section but with the change of
                    administration and the McCarthy period, nobody could be replaced until they had
                    a full field investigation. They were throwing people out right and left, not
                    for security reasons but to cut down personnel. They decimated the staff corps
                    because they could get rid of them easily but could not fire FSO's without due
                    cause. So I got a rapid series of promotions—my boss was finally selected out,
                    he hadn't been promoted for twenty years—so I went from number three, to number
                    two and agricultural attach�, to number one in the economic section and at the
                    same time I became the junior political officer. At the very end the DCM went
                    off to the War College and he convinced the ambassador that his replacement
                    would be coming from Austria in about two weeks and that I could handle it until
                    then. So I became the acting DCM and chief political officer and the two weeks
                    stretched into three months. It may have been the nadir of my career but I have
                    never been promoted so fast. Promoted only in title and responsibility—as Acting
                    DCM I was the lowest paid officer on the diplomatic list.</p>
                <p>The DCM was really my mentor in Latin American affairs and we became very close
                    despite our very different styles.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Richard A. Johnson, one of the Galesburg Swedes. He was writing a
                    detailed analysis of the history and political structure of the Trujillo regime:
                    the Trujillo apparatus, the Partido Dominicano, the extended Trujillo family and
                    their interrelationships, how he actually operated, etc. One thing that Trujillo
                    always did was to make sure that nobody was ever sure of their job. Even Paulino
                    who was number two and the only one who could make even a small decision on his
                    own, was suddenly found to be a traitor my last month there. Trujillo didn't
                    kill them off as many dictators do; in almost all cases they were sent into
                    exile, sometimes with jobs, sometimes not. But if they didn't complain, if they
                    didn't try to undermine him or join the opposition, they had a chance to come
                    back again. Johnson was absolutely fascinated by his cold-blooded Machiavellian
                    operations.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Trujillo was, as I said, tremendously aggressive and energetic but he was stuck
                    with this little country, sharing an island with Haiti. Haiti had invaded them
                    twice for long periods. The Dominican Republic is a mulatto nation but they
                    regarded themselves as part of the Spanish heritage, loyal Catholics at the
                    frontier of western civilization against the black pagans of Haiti (who of
                    course are also Roman Catholic). The Catholic bishop of Haiti said that the
                    Haitians were 90% Catholic and 100% voodoo. Well, the Dominicans were voodoo
                    too, but that was never acknowledged. Haiti was the great enemy and that was one
                    reason, probably, that he ordered the massacre of the Haitians. He needed the
                    Haitians to cut the sugar cane but to ease political tensions, he turned on them
                    and drove them out—temporarily. Johnson always felt that if we didn't make our
                    position very clear, that we would never allow it, the Dominicans would march
                    into Haiti some day. He thought that from the political point of view that was
                    the main danger we had to worry about.</p>
                <p>The political problems could not be separated from the economic. The Trujillo
                    family dominated the Dominican economy except for the foreign interests,
                    primarily American and Canadian. Aside from the sugar companies, the American
                    owned power company and the telephone company were the big capital investments.
                    Johnson felt that if Trujillo was frustrated in his ambitions to take over Haiti
                    he might turn inward and take measures against American owned companies. I never
                    took this too seriously because Trujillo would know that trying to run Haiti was
                    just asking for more trouble. Johnson thought that Trujillo was acting more and
                    more irrationally, becoming more and more of a megalomaniac. I disagreed after
                    reading Ellis Briggs' reports from years back; Trujillo's personality and
                    actions seemed to have changed little over the years. That was really our only
                    major disagreement: Dick thought the “Jefe” had crossed the borderline of
                    psychosis; I thought he was still as rational as he ever had been.</p>
                <p>Johnson asked me if I would try to find out how much of the country Trujillo
                    owned, how much his income might be and how much money he was getting out of the
                    country. I found out that many of the companies that were agents for American
                    imports were owned by the Trujillo family. They controlled one-third of the
                    arable land. Also that the family levied a tax of 10% on all goods coming into
                    the country, over and above the tariff. The army acted as Trujillo's police
                    force and sometimes the work force for his enterprises. That was the atmosphere
                    of the place. I wrote a 70 page report on all aspects. Surprisingly, most of my
                    material came from published documents—reading between the lines of course.
                    Johnson had hoped that our detailed studies would help any successor
                    regime—especially the disposition of the vast properties of the Trujillo family.
                    I have a book “Trujillo—Caribbean Caesar” in Virginia whose author obviously had
                    access to our reports. In the “Plus ca change” department both Johnson and I
                    knew President Balaguer when he was a “respectable” toady for Trujillo.</p>

                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes. I wanted a European post and they gave me Algiers. That turned out
                    to be interesting because in a sense it was a colonial backwater, the last of
                    the French Empire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went out there as an economic officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes, in February of 1955. This was just after the beginning of the
                    Algerian War, on November 1, 1954. On home leave, I had seen newsreels of trucks
                    and tanks running around in the desert, and had gotten the impression that the
                    French had taken care of the uprising in short order. When I got there the
                    French said that they had put it down easily, a few Frenchmen had been killed
                    but for all that, it had been a complete fiasco, the FLN (Front Liberacion
                    Nacional) was completely defeated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have French language training before you went
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Only in college. I could read it fairly easily but it took me about six
                    months before I could work in it orally. I do remember, “S�tif ne bouge pas,”
                    (Setif doesn't budge) and, in English, “the Arab is like a child, when he acts
                    up you strike him hard.” These sayings dated from the uprising on VE Day in
                    1945, which is why most of us had never heard of it. It was followed by savage
                    reprisals—the shooting of hostages and bombing of civilians. Fortunately, the
                    order to bomb Moslem towns was given by De Gaulle's communist Minister for Air,
                    Pierre Cot, for which the FLN (the rebels) never forgave them despite French
                    efforts to tie the rebellion to the communists.</p>
                <p>Algiers was a quiet consulate general and Algeria was part of France in those
                    days. The slogan of the colony was “l'Algerie c'est la France,” because it was
                    legally a part of France. The difference was that they had eight million
                    Moslems, mostly dirt poor and primitive, and one million Europeans, of whom the
                    French were actually a minority. There were several hundred thousand Jews many
                    of whom were there when the Arabs came about 800 AD. The west was settled mostly
                    by the Spanish—Spanish was the lingua franca of the Oran area rather than
                    French. The east, the Bone area, was predominantly Italian and Maltese. It was a
                    very polyglot European population. The hierarchy was not based on religion or
                    race but on the degree of civilization. The French had a civilizing mission.
                    They were not colonists but pioneers. I have neglected the Berbers, who were
                    pre-Arab and were about half the indigenous population. They are not Semitic. St
                    Augustine was a Berber, and I believe at least one Pope.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>There were two electoral colleges; the first college was mostly European and the
                    second college, mostly Moslem—the less civilized, shall we say. From the
                    democratic point of view they unfortunately had the equal representation in
                    Paris and in the local assembly, but a first college vote was worth eight of the
                    second. With their superior economic clout and education, the first college
                    obviously ran things. There were Moslems in the first college; a Moslem could
                    join the first college if he would accept French law, basically the Napoleonic
                    code, instead of Koranic law—there were separate systems of courts, property
                    rights, etc. There were a number of Moslems in the first college, they called
                    them “evolu�,” but they could only have one wife rather than the four permitted
                    by Koranic law. There were no restrictions on mistresses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they determine what college you were in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: It was complicated but I believe that admission to the first college
                    was restricted by level of education (in French of course) and by acceptance of
                    French civil law as opposed to Koranic law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a certificate or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes. If you were born to French, Italian, Jewish, or Spanish
                    immigrants, of course, you were in the first college almost automatically. It
                    was a very complicated situation especially for mixed marriages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had a consulate general there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes, but we reported directly to the Department of State, through the
                    Paris embassy. The Consul General was an old China hand. He had been an
                    inspector, had once had the rank of ambassador, was a career minister and was
                    supposed to have been the ambassador to Thailand. His name was sent up to the
                    Senate but then there was a change of administration and “Wild” Bill Donovan,
                    former head of OSS and a staunch Republican, wanted to go there so Lewis Clark's
                    name was withdrawn. They offered him Burma, but his pride was affronted so he
                    turned it down. He would have been retired but for the fact that he was a career
                    minister. He had spent almost his entire career in China. He was a wise old man
                    but here we had another split, a generational split. He was always looking for
                    the middle ground, as the French were, looking for somebody to mediate between
                    the two sides, but we younger officers believed the time for that was long past.
                    It might have been possible to keep Algeria in the French commonwealth but the
                    political strength of the colon made the necessary concessions impossible.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Ferhat Abbas, a moderate with a French wife, was one of the leaders of the
                    nationalists who wanted a separate nation, but in the French commonwealth. He
                    could have easily gotten along with the colonial French, and they could have
                    worked out something but not as a part of France: that was an unworkable
                    situation. When de Gaulle came in, he saw immediately that France's
                    sophisticated and expensive social security system and its equally expensive
                    education system could not bear the cost of the introduction of eight million
                    poor Moslems. They were largely illiterate, had a primitive way of life and a
                    very high birth rate. This would never be accepted by the French people. The
                    people who wanted it, of course, were the grand colon, the big landowners, some
                    of whom had incomes of over a million dollars a year. They had all the advantage
                    of the high French wheat and wine subsidies. They had a vested interest in
                    Algeria. Algeria was, however, a dreadful drain on France trying to come back
                    after the war and with all its political upheavals. The colon and their far
                    right allies hoped rather openly for a “South African” solution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the consulate actually reported to Washington instead
                        of to the embassy in Paris as one would expect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes, probably because it was so different; actually Paris never took
                    much interest in us until they found out our reporting was calling the
                    Department's long-range policy into question. The U.S. was desperately trying to
                    keep France in NATO and nobody disagreed with that, but because of that they had
                    accepted as doctrine the French view that the problem was soluble if they could
                    just get enough troops over there with enough economic development. This may
                    have been true early on but not by the time we arrived.</p>
                <p>The revolt spread rapidly within the next year. Our consul general insisted that
                    we travel—it was a good thing that he did because we weren't able to at the end.
                    We went all through the east in the spring and the French had lost control (at
                    night) of many areas we had to go through to get back to Algiers. Leon Dorros
                    was the political officer and spoke fluent French. He was very aggressive and
                    badgered the prefect in Constantine into admitting that there was an uprising in
                    the north along the coast where there had never had been one before. From then
                    on it went from bad to worse.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>The FLN used terrorism very effectively to get the counter-terrorists, the French
                    colons, into action against the Moslems. Wherever there was an incident, say an
                    ambush, any male Moslem over the age of fifteen in the area would head for the
                    hills so as not to get shot. Many were shot (or lynched) and afterwards it was
                    always announced that documents had been found on them that showed they were
                    part of the rebellion. I always wondered why they carried so many documents that
                    would sentence them to death if they were stopped, particularly since many were
                    illiterate. We began to keep track of this unrest as it spread. A little more
                    than a year of that and it went from the French having virtually complete
                    control of Algeria to their being besieged in Algiers and other major cities.
                    They went out of the city only in the daytime and then with an armed escort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you couldn't get out of Algiers either?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Only by flying. It was slower in spreading to the west and we were able
                    to get to Oran and other areas until just before we left in 1957.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you doing anything on the economic side? What
                        economic interests did we have there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: We had practically none by then. I concentrated on the impact of the
                    rebellion on the Algerian economy. As my French got better I found out that in
                    the report of the Governor General there was a balance of payments calculated
                    between Algeria and France. It was very revealing; it showed what it cost for
                    the subsidies, etc., which were coming into the country from France, shocking
                    figures. I wrote a couple of reports on that and then I made a horrendous
                    mistake at one of the few social events that we had in those days. There I met a
                    Madame Tixier and said, “Are you connected with Monsieur Tixier, the Director of
                    Finance for Algeria.” Oh, yes, she was his wife. So I said, “I admire very much
                    the fine report he publishes, the greatest mistake I ever made in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>He came in later, and said she told him that I was an admirer of his. He asked me
                    why, and I told him that I found his report very useful in understanding the
                    economic situation. Because Algiers was an integral part of France it had taken
                    me a while to realize that this report addressed the balance of payments between
                    the two entities. He said, “You're right,” and that was the last time they ever
                    published it! But they didn't need to, I had gotten the main points on the
                    magnitude of what Algeria was actually costing the French economy. It was a
                    terrible strain and did not count the cost of the French military. They had
                    600,000 soldiers there by the time we left—they had to increase the draft, call
                    up reserve officers, pull troops out of NATO, and use American equipment
                    designated for NATO contrary to their commitments.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Neither the consul general or his deputy understood the force of nationalism nor
                    that this nationalism was why the French were going to lose. The French were
                    fond of saying that there never was an Algerian nation. I always wanted to reply
                    that there never was an Algeria until they created it by taking over in 1825 and
                    running it as a unit. The French created nationalism and now these people from
                    diverse tribes and peoples thought of themselves as Algerians and they were not
                    going to be French, they didn't want to be French. The French liberals believed
                    that there was a middle way in which Algeria could be a part of France or
                    related to it in some way. Lewis Clark believed that too; he thought that the
                    moderates on both sides could get together. But the colon was absolutely adamant
                    and they largely controlled the Radical Socialist Party, a Centrist Party that
                    was by necessity in any French government formed. The weak French governments
                    that resulted could not act. De Gaulle faced it by saying it was either France
                    or Algeria and as a French nationalist, he was willing to say goodbye to
                    Algeria—and had the strength to carry it through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where had this situation gotten to by the time you left in
                        1957?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Let me first finish on the subject of the split in the consulate. The
                    consul general and his deputy were on one side while the junior officers almost
                    entirely agreed that the French cause was hopeless. When we left, I stopped in
                    Paris at the request of Jack Tuthill, Economic Minister there. He couldn't come
                    to Algeria himself because the French were so paranoid about American
                    interference. He asked me to tell him what was happening on the economic
                    front—they had discovered oil in Algeria about this time just to add complexity.
                    There was something worth fighting over after all. The colon used to accuse the
                    U.S. of being after oil and I used to reply, “There is no evidence that you have
                    any oil here.” The American, Dutch and British petroleum engineers had all
                    assured me there wasn't any oil in Algeria, but they proved wrong as I was. The
                    embassy had no idea of the economic impact of the rebellion and its drain on
                    France. Tuthill wanted to see my report on this that I had just completed in
                    Algiers.</p>
                <p>In passing, Tuthill asked me what I thought of the military situation. I said,
                    “Of course that's hopeless.” He jumped up from his chair and said, “What! Do you
                    believe that?” “Of course I believe it.” “Do the others believe it.” “Lewis
                    Clark doesn't nor his deputy but I think all the junior officers there believe
                    it is just a matter of time, a matter of how much punishment the French are
                    willing to take.” So he said, “I think you better see the ambassador, Amory
                    Houghton was the ambassador then Charlie Yost was his deputy, newly arrived.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>It seems that Jack Tuthill was the naysayer in the embassy. He had recently come
                    from Germany, he had never served in France before, and he disagreed with many
                    of the officers in the embassy about Algeria. I did talk with the ambassador and
                    with Tuthill. Charlie Yost gave me a good cross examination but I stuck to my
                    position. The ambassador thanked me afterwards but said that I had ruined his
                    day. It was the first time he had heard such a negative assessment contrary to
                    what his political section and the military attach�s had been telling him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went back to Washington, in 1957?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes, and there I took Phil Habib's place in INR. I became chairman of
                    an inter-departmental intelligence working group on the Sino-Soviet Economic
                    Offensive. My dislike for research as a way of life was one reason I left
                    graduate work and it was confirmed in INR. Fortunately I was chairman and other
                    people, mostly in State and CIA, did the research.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling in general about INR? Did you feel
                        it was not a place a Foreign Service officer would want to be assigned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Well this was part of the Wristonization program and there was a lot of
                    misunderstanding about it. I was recruited for the job by Phil Habib because
                    they insisted on another economist. He was one of the very first FSO's that INR
                    deigned to accept from the Foreign Service because of his Ph.D. in economics. As
                    Phil said, they thought we were cocktail party types, smooth and superficial
                    with no intellectual depth. They also insisted on high academic credentials. INR
                    had a lot of former OSS people, it was full of eccentrics. Phil Habib wrote that
                    I was going to have to come to the Department sometime and while it was not the
                    most exciting job, it had substance. Lewis Clark, who was a wise old guru, said
                    it was better to go to someplace where they want you rather than where they did
                    not, so I accepted Phil's offer. I practically went crazy there the first few
                    months after Algiers where bombs were going off every night and we were
                    practically besieged. Although considered a backwater by FSO's at that time, I
                    met many of the most dynamic and successful FSO's there including Dean Hinton
                    and Tom Enders to begin with.</p>
                <p>Our first child was born in Algiers, right in the middle of the battle of
                    Algiers. It took two French parachute divisions and a brigade of the Foreign
                    Legion to suppress the rampant terrorism in the city. Contrary to the well known
                    Italian movie on the subject, which was generally quite accurate, the FLN was
                    badly defeated in the city but won the war in the countryside a la Mao. Our main
                    worry was the curfew strictly enforced. Fortunately the baby cooperated.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>This was the first time I had worked for the State Department in Washington, so
                    there was a lot of adjusting. It was a different world. My job was more
                    operational than research. I took over from Phil Habib, my classmate and fellow
                    economist. We worked closely with the CIA, who did the operational part, putting
                    out a biweekly publication and semi-annual summary. The analysts in CIA did part
                    of it and the analysts in INR did a part, the country specialists. I worked with
                    probably thirty or forty people every week to turn out these publications.</p>
                <p>At that time the so-called Sino-Soviet economic offensive was considered the
                    economic version of the domino theory. There were two approaches to it; one,
                    that the Russians couldn't do anything right because they didn't know borsch
                    from lubricating oil, and secondly, that they were absolutely superhuman in the
                    efficiency of their organization—all run from station Moscow. Of course, there
                    is a basic contradiction in those approaches but one had to live with that. I
                    found it interesting and got to know the economic problems of virtually every
                    developing country in the world; I also learned a lot about the Soviet Union and
                    Marxian economics. I became known as a Soviet economic expert over the years. It
                    doesn't take much in the land of the blind. I was approached three times to see
                    if I would be interested in going to Moscow as economic counselor. I always used
                    the excuse that I didn't speak Russian to which they replied that they would
                    send me to the Bertchesgaden language school. Then I had to fall back on the
                    fact that I was approaching forty and was getting too old to learn a rather
                    complex language. Of course, sometimes to friends I gave the real reason: that
                    my wife would probably divorce me if I went to Moscow. So I never became a
                    Soviet specialist.</p>
                <p>Although INR tends to be one of the more obscure places in State, Douglas Dillon,
                    then Under Secretary of State, took an active interest in our bailiwick. He set
                    up a special advisory group and brought Phil Habib back from his overseas
                    assignment to head it. We were doing one of the few things in INR that was top
                    drawer for the policy makers, probably the early economic one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At one time wasn't part of INR spun off to CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: That was part of the integration program. The biographic section was
                    spun off because that required a rather narrow specialty and the Foreign Service
                    officers were not particularly good at it, nor interested in it. It was
                    transferred bodily over to CIA. Since that time I think other things have been
                    phased out. INR was one of the children of OSS, the other child was CIA. The
                    covert side went to CIA and the overt side initially went to State. But it was
                    much easier to get money for CIA, especially for long term specialized research,
                    and so I think the State Department became much more dependent on CIA after
                    integration. We got along very well in our working group. It was a quiet four
                    years and we became deeply entrenched in the United States again. It was a
                    wrench to go abroad again with two small children.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you request to go back to Japan then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Because of my background on developing countries, I was recruited as
                    Technical Secretary for the Colombo Plan when we hosted it in Seattle. Secretary
                    of State Dulles went out for a whole week to chair it after two weeks of
                    meetings at the lower level. I was one of three technical secretaries under the
                    secretary general. So I developed another specialty—in multilateral diplomacy
                    and international organizations, and I got to see the Secretary of State close
                    up. It was basically a British Commonwealth organization for South and Southeast
                    Asia. The Japanese were hosting it two years later and they asked for some help
                    because it was the first international meeting they had hosted after the war.
                    They were worried about their command of English and they wanted some people
                    with experience to help out. They asked for four people from State, and
                    particularly asked for me because the Japan delegation knew me from the first
                    meeting in Seattle. It ended up that they only got me from the U.S. There was
                    also a British financial commissioner from New Delhi who spoke Japanese, and an
                    Australian and a New Zealander. We were assigned to the Foreign Office for three
                    weeks as members of the Japanese delegation. The Japanese didn't really need
                    much help because their post-war foreign service officers are great in English.
                    The pre-war English of officers was generally pretty awful, even after a thirty
                    year career because they learned their English from other Japanese. They taught
                    it to each other so just replicated the accents and awkward usage. Now all
                    entering officers are sent to American or British universities for two years and
                    become very fluent but with either American or English accents.</p>
                <p>My friends in the Foreign Office told me I was the first American since the Meiji
                    Restoration to serve in the Foreign Office. My British colleague Stanley Charles
                    from New Delhi and I acted as integral parts of the Foreign Office and sat with
                    them on the dais which caused a few raised eyebrows. The Japanese did not need
                    our help on English, but we earned our per diem by advising on Robert's Rules of
                    Order and in an all night session helping draft the Prime Minister's speech.</p>
                <p>As a result of this assignment through Ed Doherty, my former boss in INR who was
                    economic counselor in Tokyo, I got to know the economic minister, Phil Trezise.
                    I indicated an interest in coming back because I wanted to see Japan from an
                    Embassy instead of under military occupation and my wife loved Japan. So after a
                    quiet four years in INR, this provided an opportunity to get my foot in again in
                    post-war Japan. As the result of my unusual assignment to the Foreign Office, I
                    had friendly relations with several dozen Japanese diplomatic officers at all
                    levels which stood me in good stead not only in Tokyo and Washington but all
                    over the world at international meetings until my retirement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Tokyo in 1961 as an economic officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes, as division chief of the internal division. We did the economic
                    analysis of Japan and conducted the diplomatic negotiations on bilateral
                    economic issues. The first thing I got into was textiles, so that became my
                    temporary specialty; but my primary responsibility became the analysis of
                    Japan's economy. It was an interesting time. They were just beginning the ten
                    year doubling the income program; this was when the tremendous rate of growth
                    started. Trezise, Doherty and I were among the few who believed they could do
                    it. Actually, we were too conservative. The Japanese had to revise the plan
                    after the third year because they were already so far ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a large economic section there at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Oh yes. It was one of our largest embassies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we had large economic interests there at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes. Trade was growing by leaps and bounds and the Japanese had
                    worrisome problems that were politically sensitive. One was cotton textiles; we
                    were enforcing the voluntary quotas—the Japanese used to call them the
                    “involuntary” voluntary quotas. They were right, of course, but that was the
                    payment of President Kennedy to South Carolina and North Carolina because they
                    elected him after Ohio went for Nixon. The other sensitive point was the balance
                    of payments deficit—theirs, not ours. In was about $100 million a year. They
                    complained that we wanted them to restrain their exports when there were few
                    things they could make and sell to us. We used to tell them that they should
                    look at the balance of payments in the context of global trade, not bilaterally;
                    also that a country developing as fast as Japan should expect a large deficit on
                    the balance of payments. So they worked hard to overcome that and they sort of
                    over compensated for it—by a factor of ten.</p>
                <p>I used to do a briefing on the textile issues for the political and public
                    relations types who usually are not interested at all in something as mundane as
                    trade, except when it becomes a sensitive item between governments and
                    peoples—in the headlines in other words. The average American had practically no
                    interest in foreign trade, but every Japanese knew virtually everything about it
                    and was extremely conscious of it. My complaint about our political officers was
                    not so much that they didn't know anything about business or economics but that
                    they said it as if they were proud of it. That attitude sometimes infuriated
                    hard-pressed U.S. businessmen.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I have never met a Japanese foreign service officer who is not able to talk
                    intelligently and vehemently about complicated economic issues. As an
                    introduction to my textile briefing, to show how things turn around, I used
                    material that my wife, who is interested in Japanese history, found and knew
                    would interest me. During our Civil War when the cotton imports were cut off we
                    used to import raw cotton from Japan. While I was in Japan, we were exporting
                    huge quantities of raw cotton to Japan to make into cloth and telling them that
                    they should not send the finished product back to us. On trade, I have always
                    maintained vis-a-vis Japan that we were and are more sinned against than sinning
                    but are too ready to resort to petty protectionism weakening our efforts to open
                    up their markets.</p>
                <p>Their economic growth was absolutely incredible; we could hardly believe it;
                    seventeen percent for one year in real terms. I remember there was a steady
                    change in the composition of the trade, both imports and exports, which
                    foreshadowed future problems. We could see even from quarterly statistics how
                    the exports to the United States were changing from conventional things like tea
                    and raw and manufactured silk, simple machinery, etc. to much more sophisticated
                    products. That was the beginning of what they called their star export system.
                    Japan never had an overall economic plan like most developing countries, but
                    MITI and the Finance Ministry would work together with industry and the banks
                    and decide where the credit and resources should go, concentrating on foreign
                    trade, while largely ignoring Japanese consumer interests, a pattern that
                    largely obtains today although it can no longer be justified on any grounds.
                    Japan's consistent huge surpluses on their balance of payments threaten the
                    stability of the international trade and financial system on which their
                    prospering depends.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Edwin Reischauer</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was he as Ambassador? Did he do well at running the
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Personally he was a charming person. At first he had a DCM, Bill
                    Leonhart, who ran the embassy like a Navy ship. Reischauer was really only
                    interested in the U.S.-Japan relationship long range. He was born in Japan of a
                    missionary background—he had a Japanese wife who is a descendant of the Meiji
                    aristocracy. He had a deep emotional attachment to Japan and I think the war
                    must have been a traumatic experience for him as it was for the Japanese who had
                    a foot in both camps. After the occupation ended we showed our finesse by
                    sending out a Foreign Service officer by the name of Douglas MacArthur II; I
                    think that was about the dumbest thing we have ever done. Many of my friends
                    told me he was a terrible man to work for and his wife was even worse. So after
                    them, Reischauer and Mrs. Reischauer seemed like saints. Everybody liked them,
                    in fact he was almost revered, especially by the language officers.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>MacArthur II, while unlovable was such a strong man that he made the American
                    ambassador The President's representative in Japan rather than the commander of
                    U.S. Forces, Far East. We still operated pre-Reischauer pretty much as if there
                    was a senior/junior relationship. I found out recently while working on some
                    files for publication that an American ambassador, John Allison in the 1950's,
                    called over the senior man on American affairs in the Foreign Office to read the
                    riot act to him regarding Japanese export controls to the Soviet Bloc. This
                    amazed me because an ambassador always goes to the Foreign Office; you don't
                    call over a senior Foreign Office man to report to you. Imagine trying that with
                    the Europeans, even a small country! The Japanese let it be known that that was
                    going to end when Reischauer came out there. From then on only the Ambassador
                    would deal with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, and he would do the
                    calling, not the Japanese. That is exactly what happened, Reischauer treated the
                    Japanese as equals.</p>
                <p>Reischauer's analysis of the political situation in Japan was that as Japan
                    became more prosperous, country people would be moving into the cities to work
                    in industry. Instead of voting conservative as they had before, they would join
                    trade unions and vote for the more left wing anti-American or neutralist parties
                    which might gain control thereby. This could bring into question our base
                    agreements and alliance. I have been thinking a lot about what went wrong. A
                    friend, a former FSO and noted Japanese scholar, questioned it then; he said the
                    Ambassador was wrong. He thought the extremes, the nationalist right and the
                    communist left would become less and less important and it would be impossible
                    to form a government without a coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party which
                    would act as a brake on any move to the left or isolation. As it happened he was
                    right but he has just told me that Japan still does not have a viable
                    opposition. It is a too complicated an analysis to bring up here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There must have been a huge difference in Japan in 1961
                        from the Japan of the occupation, was there not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Well, they are always rebuilding Japan but the people and culture
                    change much more slowly. It is hard to make a comparison, but I liked it much
                    better the second time. There had been a lot of racism and condescension in the
                    occupation. The Japanese were segregated on the railroads and other places as
                    late as 1951 until MacArthur was relieved and Ridgeway took over. Ridgeway saw
                    the long lines of Japanese waiting for the trains and next to them a yellow and
                    black pipe and next to a large empty space. He said, “What the hell are these
                    things? and was told that the empty space was for Americans. “Take them down!”
                    was his reply; you should have heard the wailing. So all that had gone and the
                    atmosphere was much better. You dealt with the Foreign Office as equals, and
                    that is very easy for Americans because they all speak good English there
                    now.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>One of our deep, dark secrets is that most of our language officers are not
                    really capable of carrying on technical discussions in Japanese although that
                    may be changing. I have been gone a long time.</p>
                <p>We take advantage of that too. One of my biggest responsibilities was the Joint
                    Annual Economic Committee meetings of cabinet ministers of both countries. That
                    came in with the Kennedy administration; Secretary Rusk used to attend with six
                    cabinet members with economic responsibilities. They would meet for three days
                    in alternate capitals and discuss every subject of mutual concern. After the
                    first meeting in 1961, I was responsible for the organization and coordination,
                    both substantive and administrative, at the next five meetings first in Tokyo
                    and later in the U.S. They included wives so programs had to be arranged for the
                    spouses, and all the advisors. It got to be immensely
                    complicated—transportation, social events, etc. Substantively, there were the
                    briefing books and at the end negotiating the communique, always an all night
                    session. That was a liberal education in the operation of the United States
                    government in diplomacy. I don't think I could have recruited any of our Foreign
                    Service officers from around the world who could have negotiated the communique
                    in Japanese. We always did it in English and it was translated into Japanese
                    later. So much for equal treatment; it is an enormous advantage for us to be
                    able to do that. I had a brush with history in Tokyo in late 1963 when I was
                    coordinating the Joint Committee meeting at that end. I had buttoned down the
                    last loose end and had gone to bed early in preparation for the early morning
                    arrival of Secretary Rusk and party. About 3 a.m. I was awakened by a telephone
                    call from the head of TIME/LIFE for the Far East asking about the effect of
                    President Kennedy's death on the meeting. Of course, Rusk ordered Air Force One
                    to turn back to Washington. Five of the six cabinet members were aboard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you went back to the Department of State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes, in 1964. There used to be an Office of Northeast Asian Affairs and
                    I was assigned there as economic advisor. My predecessor was a civil servant who
                    had been a senior official in the occupation and I was the first FSO who came
                    back they thought knew enough about the economic side to relieve her. She went
                    to Policy Planning. Then they abolished NEA as an office and I became a special
                    assistant to the Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs who was Bill Bundy,
                    brother of “Mac”. He was never exactly fascinated with economics; a corporate
                    lawyer, he came from CIA and the Defense Department and was deeply involved with
                    Vietnam at that time. The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs was
                    Bob Barnett and I worked for him about nine tenths of the time. Occasionally I
                    did work with Bill Bundy on military hardware things but I tried to stay out of
                    Vietnam, that was where careers were being made in those days and so almost
                    everybody wanted to work on that. I thought some attention ought to be paid to
                    Japan and Indonesia and maybe even China.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>It was a fascinating but demanding job. One of the first things I got into was
                    China. I didn't even know there was a major study project underway looking to a
                    future opening to Mainland China. In those days you could be hung, drawn, and
                    quartered for even thinking about it. It was one of the most comprehensive
                    projects I have ever seen with studies on all facets. Everything was there. When
                    the Nixon administration came in and decided to do the unthinkable—which they
                    could being conservative—they had the scenario. Phase one and phase two, the
                    easy things first, the harder things to follow. It never got past State at that
                    time. CIA did most of the detailed factual research and EB did the economic
                    analysis while we did the political spade work.</p>
                <p>We got all the clearances at the working level except for that of Assistant
                    Secretary for East Asia, Bill Bundy. Bob and I went in one Saturday after he had
                    seen it for the first time and he was angrily picking it to pieces and demanding
                    changes. Finally he said to make the changes and he would sign off on it. I said
                    to Bob, “What is the matter with him?” “Why is he so angry?” He answered, “He
                    signed it because he knew he should but he is angry because he knows what the
                    Secretary is going to say about it.” So it went to Secretary Rusk and he gave it
                    to Katzenbach who had just come in as Under Secretary and said, “Here, Nick,
                    this is something for you to cut your teeth on.”</p>
                <p>Katzenbach had just addressed a Foreign Service Association lunch challenging us
                    to come up with new and daring ideas, new thinking, new approaches to problems,
                    the works. On hearing of this I said, “Wait until he reads what is in his in
                    box.” It was like handing him a live hand grenade.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I left shortly after for Denmark, a good place to hide. This was 1968. Anyway
                    that was the last I heard of it, Katzenbach may have deep-sixed it. But it was
                    apparently kept on the shelf, the back shelf. I can't prove this, but when I
                    read about the Nixon/Kissinger new approach to China, it fitted beautifully. If
                    you have a good idea in foreign affairs, never throw it away. I understand that
                    the idea for Point Four came from somebody in the Economic Affairs Bureau who
                    had been trying to sell that idea for years. When Truman needed something for
                    his 1949 State of the Union speech, or Inauguration speech, he took his idea
                    over to the White House (not through channels) and the President said, “Oh, this
                    is a wonderful idea.” So suddenly we had the President saying we were going to
                    have a technical assistance program; Point Four because it was point four in his
                    speech. I had lunch with Bob Barnett recently for the first time in many years
                    (June 1994). I told him that when I read about Kissinger's bold new policy on
                    China, the only thing that he had omitted from the original scenario was the
                    ping pong diplomacy which had initiated it. Bob smiled but modestly refused to
                    confirm (or deny). The China paper was probably the most important project I
                    worked on though it didn't go anywhere on my watch. Indonesia was next. That was
                    right after the communist uprising which Sukarno was running behind the scenes.
                    Suharto had a division of troops outside of Jakarta which he marched in to
                    protect the “father of the revolution.” So Sukarno switched sides immediately
                    but everyone knew he tried to use the uprising to get absolute power. Indonesia
                    was very close to becoming a communist satellite at that time. So there were the
                    tremendously complicated problems of rescheduling Indonesia's debts, getting our
                    AID program going again and getting multilateral economic assistance started.
                    There were large debts to the communist bloc, mostly for military equipment,
                    primarily to the Soviet Union but quite a bit to communist China. It was
                    enormously complicated, we couldn't get the Congress or our Allies to go along
                    with rescheduling the debts, unless the Soviets and the Chinese did. The Soviets
                    told the Indonesians that they had to get the Chinese to make equal
                    concessions—and they did. I suppose both still hoped to keep a foot in the door.
                    We asked the Dutch to coordinate this; they chaired the meetings of the
                    multilateral group of the western countries. Then when the debts were
                    rescheduled so that debt repayment wouldn't take all foreign exchange earnings
                    we got the IBRD, the IMF and the Asian Development Bank to help Indonesia. And
                    it worked.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>I worked on virtually everything in East Asia, but I stayed out of the
                    Philippines; our relations there are too complicated. In many cases we acted as
                    economic advisors to the desks, so I got involved in most countries. Bob
                    Barnett, Bill Thomas and I were in effect the senior economic policy officers
                    for EA except for Japan where the country director and my replacement from Tokyo
                    ran things; but several of the country directors wouldn't touch economic issues.
                    I didn't think ours was good organization; everything should have been
                    concentrated at the country director level and they should be involved in all
                    major policy matters. When I came back from Denmark in 1971, I made a
                    recommendation that was accepted: that there be an economic policy planning
                    office at the bureau level which could handle highly complicated technical
                    issues that come up occasionally; integrated to do economic analysis for the
                    Bureau, and to act as a resource for the smaller country desks. After I left for
                    the Senior Seminar this was implemented and is still operating, very well as far
                    as I know. So in my last five years before retirement I had the dubious honor of
                    creating two new offices: dubious because maybe one shouldn't boast about
                    creating more bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>There is a basic problem in integrating policy. The political bureaus see
                    everything from the point of view of how best to accomplish their country
                    objectives; political-military for the most part. Japan is an extreme
                    example—the question of keeping our bases and our defense alliance has been the
                    all consuming issue which has led to the current stalemate. The economic affairs
                    bureau used to be run by specialists and had some outstanding people, but with
                    integration the economists came into the Foreign Service and so they had to
                    create a program to train junior officers in economics on a systematic
                    basis.</p>
                <p>The regional bureaus and Policy Planning often regard EB as the enemy, trying to
                    circumvent the Secretary's, and their, political objectives. EB has to think
                    about the domestic constituencies which are the main concern of the Congress and
                    often the White House. Someone has to go up and justify these things to
                    Congress. You have to have someone who can handle the special interests. It
                    should not be two warring constituencies if both mandates are interpreted
                    properly and both are highly political. Senior FSO's must understand both. As a
                    Japanese FSO replied when asked why when our Embassy had fishery questions to
                    discuss with the Foreign Office, sometimes we dealt with the political bureaus
                    and other times with the economic. The answer is easy to remember: the political
                    bureau handles live fish, the economic bureau handles dead fish.</p>
                <p>That was brought home to me in Denmark when our press officer assured the Foreign
                    Minister not to be too concerned about U.S. complaints about the Danes taking
                    Atlantic salmon on the high seas because it was just the sport of such rich fat
                    cat celebrities as Bing Crosby, Ted Williams, etc. He made the mistake of
                    reporting his effort to smooth relations with the Danes as a feather in his cap.
                    We got one of the worst blasts, quite deservedly, from Washington I could recall
                    “to educate the embassy” that this was probably the most sensitive fisheries
                    issue we dealt with, both domestically and diplomatically, with Japan and the
                    USSR. Needless to say, the press attach� had never served in any other post.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get from East Asia to Europe—to Copenhagen in
                        1968?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Do you want the truth? Because I couldn't get a decent job in East
                    Asia. I was the EA candidate for a long time to be the deputy U.S. director of
                    the Asia Development Bank at the request of the Director because I helped set it
                    up. Then EB came up with a candidate and Phil Habib told me, “You are not going
                    to get that job because EA doesn't have any clout and Tony Solomon does in EB.”
                    He was quite right, but EA hung on for almost a year keeping me on tenterhooks.
                    I then got vetoed for the job of economic counselor in Taiwan because the
                    Ambassador, an old China hand, suspected that I was soft on Chiang Kai-shek. I
                    got the assignment because of a man I had never met, the personnel officer for
                    Europe, who knew my record in EA and in Tokyo and didn't care for the other
                    candidates for the job. Logic sometimes has little to do with personnel
                    assignments in the Foreign Service and the “Peter Principle” is alive and
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador to Denmark at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Actually we had three. Mrs. White, a political appointee, was there
                    when I was appointed. Then Angier Biddle Duke, who had been chief of protocol,
                    wanted to go abroad again so he intervened with the President who called her up
                    at the airport on her way back to Denmark and said, “Kate, I am afraid you are
                    going to have to resign because Angie wants the job.” This was September or
                    October of 1968 with a presidential election coming up in November, which you
                    may recall, the Democrats lost. So Duke was ambassador for only a little over a
                    month when he became a lame duck. However, he convinced himself that he might be
                    held on by President Nixon because his name was Duke and Nixon went to Duke
                    University law school on a scholarship. It is amusing how people can kid
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you got another political appointee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes, a Goldwater Republican from Tennessee, Guilford Dudley. He was an
                    international playboy and president of the insurance company that his father had
                    founded. He brought the jet set to Copenhagen. He was a pleasant enough person
                    but he didn't have the slightest idea of what an Ambassador is supposed to do.
                    He was really a socialite playboy; he had an attention span of about ten to
                    thirty seconds. His main concern was whether to wear miniature or full
                    decorations when he called on the King and he would not accept our unanimous
                    view that American Ambassadors do not wear decorations on their formal wear.
                    They do now in Denmark! I think Dudley got his impression of diplomatic life
                    from vodka ads.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a large embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Much too large. There were one hundred Americans there but they kept
                    cutting the State Department side, mostly economic positions. BALPA program, the
                    balance of payments hassle, remember that? The chancery became the Copenhagen
                    branch of GSA, the housing for USG agencies operating in Denmark and related
                    services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the economic problems that you were involved in
                        with Denmark?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Most of them we caused ourselves, but we really didn't have any major
                    problems with Denmark. That is another of my theories; I think it would be much
                    better in small, quiet embassies like that where we have mostly multilateral
                    relationships to have a permanent Charg� d'affaires, because most of our
                    problems are created by our ambassadors. You don't need a great big house, you
                    don't need a chauffeur, etc. The Foreign Office doesn't care, in fact they would
                    rather talk with someone who knows something. I think Ambassador Dudley went
                    there because being a constitutional monarchy, Denmark has a King and there are
                    many people around with titles. None of them have any power whatsoever and
                    normally the American Ambassador deals with Social Democrats. I was the acting
                    DCM for about seven months and had to deal with the Ambassador daily. Our
                    relations were quite cordial, but it was very difficult. He had to be in charge
                    and make the decisions, but I had to make sure he made the right decisions since
                    he didn't know anything about the problems. He was completely dependent on his
                    staff. We were always walking on eggs. It was not a happy relationship to put it
                    mildly. I now understand why the failure rate for DCMs is so high. International
                    diplomacy is a breeze compared to internal relations with amateurs in
                    charge.</p>
                <p>When I learned accidentally that the Ambassador had never met the head of the
                    Social Democratic party, Mr. Krag, who had been Prime Minister for five years
                    just previously and was only a hair's breath away from coming back again, I
                    asked the Ambassador if he didn't think it might be a good idea to invite him to
                    his house so he would know the man he might well be dealing with in the near
                    future. “Well, I asked him, and he wouldn't come!” was his reply which shocked
                    me. I went to see the Danish national who acted as our protocol advisor and told
                    him what the Ambassador had said and asked, “What gives?” “Did he tell you the
                    whole story?” “He had his secretary call Mr. Krag the night before and asked him
                    to a reception.” And the Social Democrats came back to power next election! Not
                    that it made much difference. His relations with Prime Minister Krag could
                    hardly be worse than with the conservative coalition that he dealt with during
                    most of his incumbency. The Foreign Minister refused to receive him for weeks at
                    a time, and Dudley refused to call on the career Vice Minister so we often had
                    gridlock on urgent problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was a pleasant posting, nonetheless, was it
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>WOODBURY: Of course, except for the embassy and going to work. I said that after
                    the places I had been—the Dominican Republic under Trujillo, Japan during the
                    Korean War, the Algerian war with its terrorism—I thought the Department was
                    rewarding me for the past by giving me a sinecure. I found out, however, that
                    when there is not enough to do, “the devil has work for idle hands.” I won't go
                    into some of those details, they are too sordid. They were troubles mostly
                    caused by just plain foolishness and lack of leadership on the part of too many
                    of the key members of the career staff with a vacuum at the top. Speaking of
                    vacuums, I served six ambassadors, all political. That must be close to a
                    record. I hasten to add we never put Reischauer in that category.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So from Denmark you came back to the United States and
                        were in the Department from 1971 until you retired in 1980, is that correct?
                        First in the East Asian Bureau as an economic advisor and then the Senior
                        Seminar. But most of your time was in the Bureau of International
                        Organizations and I think that was the one you wanted to speak to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOODBURY: Yes. This was a new field for me, though I had been involved in a
                    number of multilateral negotiations. I was in charge of the regional economic
                    commissions, ECOSOC. This was just after the Sixth Special Session of the UN
                    General Assembly which was led by the Algerians after the OPEC embargo when the
                    LDC's thought they had the economic and political clout to change the terms of
                    trade and power relations with the developed, industrial countries. The LDC's
                    thought they should have special consideration, specialized trade preferences,
                    debt forgiveness, special access to capital, and what have you. That special
                    session turned out to be a great fiasco for the United States because we were
                    completely opposed to this so-called new international economic order (NIEO), as
                    were the Europeans and Japan. We had an absolutely ambiguous position; we didn't
                    vote for it; we didn't vote against it, we didn't abstain; it supposedly was
                    passed by acclamation but we said no we didn't approve it. That was when I came
                    into IO, which was not a very good time, and was put in charge of preparing for
                    the Seventh Special Session which was to implement the NIEO. I cursed the USDEL
                    at San Francisco for not insisting on a veto for ECOSOC as well as the Security
                    Council.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>I was outraged when I read the new international economic order. It was an
                    ultimatum to the developed world. So that was the basic issue. Here was an
                    opportunity to make the most important contribution that I ever could make to
                    policy in the Department. It seemed hopeless at the time; we were just going to
                    take another beating. The Europeans wanted to pretend they were going along with
                    it without being committed to anything. The Japanese as usual were hiding in the
                    woodwork being all things to all men. Then I found out that Tony Solomon, former
                    EB Assistant Secretary who was out of the government had been taken on by EB to
                    look at our overall commodity policy. He decided our ostensible laissez faire
                    policy on commodities was not always in our best interest nor consistent. It had
                    led to instability with the wild gyrations in prices making debt problems almost
                    impossible in the developing areas because they could never count on their
                    foreign exchange earnings. He thought that maybe if we could compromise a bit on
                    that issue it would be in our own interest in the long range as well as the
                    short range to take each commodity by itself, trying, of course, to keep control
                    of the process—not letting it imitate our own awful agricultural policy of
                    building up butter mountains, etc. I sent that up to IO Assistant Secretary Bill
                    Buffum saying that it was a great opening for the next special session. Why
                    shouldn't we ride along on that idea and take credit in the United Nations for
                    something we might do anyway! It would indicate that we were willing to
                    compromise, to move in that direction. And we could find other things on which
                    we could be flexible and take away the initiative from the LDC's. Some of Bill's
                    advisors said it was premature and impractical but the next thing I heard about
                    it was that Tom Enders had sent it up to the Secretary of State with a
                    recommendation along these lines that interested Henry Buffum. They decided to
                    jump on the bandwagon. He asked Alan Neidle, his senior advisor and me to work
                    with EB on a strategy paper which became our basic policy position for the
                    Seventh Special Session. Kissinger was convinced by a number of people that this
                    was politically wise and would cost us very little compared to the political
                    gain.</p>
                <p>Of course we had a real reaction over in Treasury. Bill Simon said, “I will die
                    first,” according to Kissinger. Kissinger said to get on with the work and that
                    he would take it up with President Ford. Ford overruled Simon and approved this
                    complete change of policy. Someone also in EB realized that the gold we had put
                    in the IMF at $35. an ounce in the 1940's was now worth $350 or more. It
                    belonged to the USG still but we couldn't use it for anything except currency
                    stabilization and by extension economic assistance. So it was suggested by Paul
                    Boeker of EB that we use this to give aid to the least developed countries.
                    Kissinger was to make the big speech up at the UN but he had to go shuttle
                    between Egypt and Israel, as usual, so Moynihan, our new Ambassador to the UN,
                    made the speech. It was so unexpected that it took the air out of the NIEO
                    sails; here we came up with sixty-six separate proposals, and we were willing to
                    meet with the LDCs and discuss almost anything on their agenda. To confirm my
                    cynicism and to my great amusement, Moynihan in his memoirs about his UN
                    experience took virtually full credit for this complex initiative although he
                    had probably been completely unaware of it until he was invited to the final
                    meeting with the Secretary.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I have managed to cover my 5 years in IO in a few paragraphs seeming to confirm
                    the snide joke that the complexity of UN issues is only equaled by their
                    unimportance. So to conclude, I will report on my own learning experience at
                    high level. I was appointed by Secretary Kissinger to take verbatim notes for
                    two of his breakfast briefing meetings, with about twenty Senators and
                    Representatives each, followed by his final strategy meeting, before he went to
                    the President, with Deputy Secretary Robinson, Under Secretary Sisco, Policy
                    Planning Director, Winston Lord, Ambassador Moynihan and Assistant Secretaries
                    Buffum (IO) and Enders (EB).</p>
                <p>I knew the rules very well—note takers are not participants and shall not say
                    anything. Moynihan who was new and completely unaware of this complex initiative
                    until that day, undertook to commend Enders on his good work. Kissinger
                    interrupted to say, “Don't praise Tom too much Pat, he's too full of himself
                    now.” I laughed as I looked up from my notes to meet the cold eyes of Henry at
                    about four feet distance with the most malevolent look I have ever received. I
                    wanted to explain that no one had told me not to laugh at his jokes either. The
                    fact that Tom Enders had worked for me as an FSO-8 in INR and Bill Buffum was my
                    classmate probably contributed to my relaxed attitude, but I could not explain
                    without further violation of the rules.</p>
