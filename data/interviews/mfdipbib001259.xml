                <p>SUE WHITMAN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Jewell Fenzi</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 9, 1990</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Jewell Fenzi on Friday, March 9, 1990. I'm
                        interviewing Sue Whitman at her home in Washington, DC. I've come
                        principally to talk to Sue about an experience she had in Karachi, Pakistan
                        in 1955-58 on the organization of Embassy wives, and also to talk to her
                        about the role she played in the preparation of the draft of the 1972
                        directive for release.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You had started to tell me how Personnel got involved in the 1972 directive.</p>
                <p>WHITMAN: The State Department Personnel office had heard nothing about the
                    directive. They were called one afternoon by AID Personnel office, which said,
                    “How is it that you people are approving that directive?” We had not seen it. So
                    we scrambled around to find a copy. It had been approved by Mr. Macomber but had
                    not reached the Personnel office.</p>
                <p>Both State Department and AID Personnel were in a state of shock over rather
                    confrontational language in the directive. I was assigned to work with Mary
                    Olmsted and Jean Joyce, the two people who we knew had had considerable to do
                    with the directive. When we called them down to our office to review the
                    directive with them, they were quite understandably very annoyed. They had
                    worked this out to their satisfaction and Macomber had approved it. Who was this
                    low level in State Department Personnel who was challenging what was being said?
                    [Jean Joyce recalls working with the narrator on the reappointment of women
                    Foreign Service employees after marriage. She believes her involvement with the
                    '72 Directive was limited to cheering on her friend and neighbor, William
                    Salisbury, who was one of the principal drafters. Mary Olmsted referred all
                    queries about this era to Jean Joyce.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position in Personnel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: Personnel Policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It doesn't soun(she laughs) very low to me.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WHITMAN: It wasn't very high. I worked together most of one afternoon with Mary
                    Olmsted on one side and Jean Joyce on the other, going over the directive word
                    for word. My attempt was to tone it down so it was not so confrontational. I
                    lost track of what happened after that but my bos(she laughs) met me in the hall
                    several days later, perhaps a week later, relatively soon afterwards anyhow. She
                    was as white as a sheet becaus(laughing again) it had just been announced that
                    Mary Olmsted was now the Director of Personnel! So she was our boss. This is the
                    kind of thing people have nightmares about in the Foreign Service! And it
                    happened to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Carol Laise was Director General at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: She came quite a bit later and I had nothing to do with women's
                    directives or what happened in the women's field from that initial experience
                    with Mary Olmsted until Carol Laise was appointed Director General. I had known
                    her in UNRRA days, and when she made the rounds of the Department to see who was
                    in Personnel, there I wa(she laughs) in the basement level. She thought that I
                    was the right person for a task force she was forming which was going to make
                    over Foreign Service personnel policy, and she wanted me to represent the Civil
                    Service. I had been hired in the Foreign Service but I took the examinations to
                    qualify for a Civil Service appointment.</p>
                <p>At that point, when the small task force was founded to make some fairly
                    substantial changes in personnel direction in the Department, I was, as I say,
                    the Civil Service group's representative. I'm not quite sure of the date here,
                    but it happened very shortly after the Carol Laise appointment, for which there
                    would be a record; I'm rather poor on dates. I then got back into the women's
                    lib problem in the State Department because at that point the women were coming
                    directly to Carol Laise, and I was assigned to see what I could figure out about
                    the situation.</p>
                <p>This was a difficult spot to be in because the women were trying to cultivate me
                    to assist them in their presentation to Carol Laise, and on the other hand the
                    word from her office was “be very cautious and very quiet and say nothing and do
                    nothing.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the group that led to establishment of the FLO
                        office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: I'm not sure. They were concerned about women's rights in the State
                    Department, I don't think it was about the AAFSW Forum report. I wrote for Carol
                    Laise a statement of what I understood their position to be, what their problems
                    were in the State Department. This was fairly soon after Carol Laise came on
                    board, whenever that was. I was not allowed to show this to the women themselves
                    but somehow a copy of it came to them and I was told that they approved the
                    statement, that they felt it was an accurate representation of problems of women
                    in the Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought I had a copy of that but I don't; I have a copy
                        of something much earlier, in 1971.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: The person who was the leader, as far as I kne(interruption of phone
                    call, then resuming). I drafted a statement for Carol Laise which was an attempt
                    to tell her what the problems were for wives in the Foreign Service as the
                    wives' group now were interpreting them. And this piece of paper did get to Hope
                    Meyers, who said that she approved the statement, that in fact it was a good
                    statement of how the Foreign Service wives felt. I had nothing more to do with
                    the wives' problems in the State Department. That ended it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what I need to now find is that document that must have
                        gone back to her over Carol Laise's signature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: I don't know. It was from me to Carol Laise and I don't know whether it
                    leaked to them or not. It was supposed to be held Secret, because Carol Laise
                    was unsure of her position with these wives; this was a brand-new problem as far
                    as she was concerned. She was not basically sympathetic. Like many people who
                    are very successful in their careers, they're not necessarily sympathetic with
                    people who haven't been so successful. Women like her didn't find that being a
                    woman had handicapped them and could not see that it was a handicap otherwise.
                    Carol wasn't sympathetic initially, but she tried to get a handle on what the
                    problem was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody was sympathetic, because the Family Liaison
                        Office (FLO) was established. These were just the nascent efforts to get
                        some sort of liaison between the Department and the families and it happened
                        rather quickly. This must have been around 1976 and the FLO office was
                        established in 1978. So someone in the Department moved with record speed to
                        do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: Wasn't Joan Wilson involved in the FLO office?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, she was involved in the Overseas Briefing Center, and
                        that of course is in the Department, at the Foreign Service Institute, and
                        that is the organization that now briefs people before they go out to posts
                        — all sorts of people; it's over in Rosslyn in one building, along with the
                        post reports and little boxes of all the material from posts. That's what
                        the Overseas Briefing Center does.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>The FLO office is located in the Department building as you enter on C Street and
                    then turn left immediately, after running that gauntlet of machines that buzz
                    because of your keys and whatnot. They have an educational counselor, they take
                    care of evacuations, education, employment; if someone is getting a divorce,
                    he/she goes there. I think people who don't know where to go for an answer go to
                    the FLO office, which, hopefully, either takes care of them or refers them
                    somewhere else. Joan was involved in the training. The first person to take care
                    of the FLO office after its establishment in 1978 was Janet Lloyd, who did a
                    lovely job and is now director of admissions at Holton-Arms School, I believe.
                    So what you were involved with, really, was Carol Laise's response to the women
                    on the very first effort at getting the FLO office established.</p>
                <p>WHITMAN: And there was a large meeting of women — there could have been 35 women
                    there in her office; that was the first, I think, confrontation between the
                    State Department and the wives that I knew of. I wasn't involved in anything
                    else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That could have been either before or after — it was
                        probably before the Forum report. The AAFSW Forum issued a report stating
                        the concerns and the need, because at that point the perception was,
                        probably true to a certain extent, that the relationship between the State
                        Department and the women had been fractured by the '72 directive. It really
                        had.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: It was very sad. Well, as I say the Personnel office had not been
                    involved before, nor was it involved after that directive. They just dropped the
                    whole thing, they didn't regard that as part of their responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, because wives aren't their responsibility.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: They weren't. Well, they did get into problems later, particularly
                    problems of equity for wives who had been divorced when the second wife received
                    all the benefit and the first wife had served for 25 or 30 years. That was taken
                    care of in 1983. But while I was there in the 70s they began to be involved in
                    such a problem but they tried to brush it off, they didn't consider it their
                    responsibility. That's why we didn't follow up on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And was it really a Personnel responsibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: I think it certainly was. They should definitely have been involved. But
                    I noticed, after Mary Olmsted was appointed as head of Personnel, there was
                    published in the entry hall to the Department a statement that this group, this
                    ad hoc committee which I believe she had headed, had been given an award by the
                    White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And which then became the Women's Action
                        Organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: But we didn't look into it because as I said we dropped our interest in
                    it immediately. But it seemed to me, in just glancing at the list of committee
                    members at that time, that those women were largely single women employed in the
                    Department, not wives; I'm not sure if that was the case but it was certainly my
                    impression. And that the wives were really taken by surprise by what was being
                    done for them tha(she laughs) they didn't necessarily want to have done for
                    them; that they were sort of written out of any responsibility in the Foreign
                    Service when they felt that they were doing useful work and were very happy to
                    be “two for the price of one”; that they were not feeling hurt by that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're absolutely right. One of the things that the
                        Women's Action Organization became the watchdog for abuses at post. I have
                        some letters written by Annette Buckland, who was later president, to
                        various admin officers telling them that their protocol directions for the
                        Embassies were not in line with the '72 directive. And I thought it was very
                        interesting that WAO took care of that, because obviously the ...</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would think so. I mean, if you're going to hand
                        down a directive, then the Embassy should follow it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: And she is not a government employee. It has no right to levy any duties
                    on her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is the tone of that original documen(thepause to look
                        for the document and Whitman's draft) which went out at one point over
                        Charles Thomas's signature.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: We obtained a copy of the original draft, it never was sent to us, we
                    obtained it after we heard about it through AID Personnel, who were very
                    critical of the draft and asked why in the world we were approving it. At that
                    point we realized we'd never seen the draft and raced around, got a copy from
                    Macomber's office; and were told that the people in charge of this were Olmsted
                    and Joyce. So these were the two women whom we called, saying “We would like to
                    talk to you about this draft.” And they were as I suggested earlier
                    understandably annoyed that Personnel was getting into this now, when they had
                    it ready to go and approved by Macomber.</p>

                <p>WHITMAN: “To all Foreign Service Posts: Joint State/AID/USIA Message. Drafted by
                    the Open Forum Panel” whatever that was. This was not what that was called.
                    Initially it was called an ad hoc committee, I think.</p>

                    ... who freely choose to assist their husbands and in so doing make a valuable

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because, as Rick Williamson said on his tape, the women
                        didn't know how to do it themselves, so they went to the Ad Hoc Committee,
                        which sent them to the Forum, and that was the platform that they used. I
                        call them “the young Turks.” They were young officers — USIA and State —
                        whose wives were so offended by management bulletin No. 20, the one that the
                        “traditional” wives put out. So what I really need to know is who those
                        traditional wives were, and how they put out a document like that in 1972, —
                        no, it was 1971 — considering that Betty Friedan had written The Feminine
                        Mystique nine years earlier, Gloria Steinem would establish MS a year later;
                        the ERA Amendment was sent to the States for ratification and the New York
                        Times headline said women are of two minds about “lib”, they want better
                        status but they aren't sure they want to go all the way with lib. And how in
                        an atmosphere and an aura like that a group of State Department wives could
                        put out that document which I gave you a copy of — the one about the
                        representational duties — is just rather extraordinary to me, really. It
                        just doesn't seem to be in synch with the times at all. It was the thing
                        that led to this, (indicating various papers) and that led to thi(Whitman

                <p>WHITMAN: I thought that the experience we had in Karachi was extraordinary,
                    because it was very much a hardship post at that time. It really had nothing to
                    recommend it. It was terribly hot, there was no air-conditioning, there was a
                    housing shortage, there was no place to go, no shops in which to buy anything.
                    It was just a desert. One thing that recommended Karachi was that Pakistan was a
                    new country and they were very open and supportive and willing to meet with
                    Americans. They often entertained Americans in their homes and so forth. From
                    that point of view it was an exceptionally good post. Otherwise it was quite a
                    hardship. Nevertheless for many of us who served in Karachi, it was one of our
                    greatest experiences, and a post we enjoyed most, because we were all so
                    involved. My husband was Deputy Director of AID and Economic Counselor of the
                    Embassy. He almost always wore these two hats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you wore two hats too as a consequence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: And at that time the thing that brought us all to life was the fact that
                    Americans were pouring into this post. The State Department staff increased
                    somewhat, the AID staff increased enormously. There was also a MAG Mission, a
                    Military Assistance Mission, which began its activities at that point. There was
                    also a Harvard group which was supposed to help Pakistan with long-range
                    planning.</p>
                <p>So day after day these American families with their little children were pouring
                    into Karachi and no provision, really, made for it. This was before the date
                    when State felt any responsibility for education. If we wanted a school, we'd
                    have to make one ourselves, and they didn't feel very much responsibility for
                    anythin(she laughs) about coping with the post.</p>
                <p>It was not leadership on the part of the Department that pulled this mission
                    together. I think Ambassadors' wives really knew almost nothing about what was
                    going on at post. I say that because after school started, when we were all so
                    deeply involved, our Ambassador's wife scheduled morning coffee. When there was
                    no wa(laughing heartily) the Embassy wives involved in the school could take
                    time off for Morning Coffee at the Embassy. I think the Ambassador's wife really
                    didn't know what was happening at the mission.</p>
                <p>People who took responsibility, actually, were David Bell, head of the Harvard
                    group that came in for long-range planning. Parenthetically, he was at one time
                    head of AID, I think after the Pakistan experience; he was also head of the
                    Budget Bureau and a natural leader who didn't hesitate to say “let's do
                    something at this post quickly before the whole thing falls apart.”</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>He had brought two children with him, and there was a whole group of people all
                    of whom had two or three or four children. They realized there was a serious
                    problem at the post which they had not anticipated, so they were eager to put
                    together something quickly. So we put together a school, including a high
                    school. We started from kindergarten on. The other person who was very helpful
                    was John O. Bell, head of the AID mission. He realized that there was an
                    important problem here.</p>
                <p>The school was a great experience for most of us and there were a great many
                    people from all walks of life who served in it. But what really happened in the
                    post is that the wives, realizing that this situation was really going to fall
                    on their backs as much as on anyone if there were to be any school at all, just
                    informally interviewed everyone who arrived at post. We wanted to know something
                    about them in depth — what kind of people they were, what they had to offer,
                    what they thought they were going to get out of the Foreign Service, what they
                    liked to do, what would interest them at the post to do, etcetera. Each of us,
                    whenever we met these people — and we made a point of meeting them all — tried
                    to find out who these women were and what they had to offer, and then to guide
                    them into something at the post because so much needed help. It was not only the
                    school but a lot of other problems.</p>
                <p>So the majority of women were involved one way or another. If not in the school,
                    we told them about the refugee camps — people who were medically oriented, had
                    social service connections, and so on really got involved deeply in those
                    terrible refugee camps, where there was no water, no food, no medical services,
                    nothing. It was a terrible situation. And many of these women mixed up the dry
                    milk in their washing machines and took it out to the camps. Also, anybody who
                    had any medical background at all gave medical services. There wasn't enough
                    water in the camp to wash off the sore before you put a Band-aid on it; it was
                    miserable.</p>
                <p>Many people who day after day, week after week, year after year helped in the
                    refugee camps tried to ameliorate the situation. There were others who got
                    interested in what the Pakistani women were trying to do in promoting crafts.
                    The Pakistani women had opened a shop — a brand-new idea on their part — and
                    were trying to develop new kinds of crafts the villagers could produce that
                    would be saleable. The American women who had had an entrepreneurial experience
                    helped them establish these outlets in the village and the shop itself, and
                    tried to give guidance on what kinds of things would sell.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Then there was another small group of women who through some personal connection
                    — say, they met the head of the museum at a dinner party or something of that
                    kind — got involved in doing over the museum in Karachi. The museum was located
                    in an old English church in the park. Nothing had happened to it — you have to
                    remember that the nation of Karachi was by then eight years old and museums were
                    not of top priority, but two women with help from several others, I think,
                    really made over that museum. They made it very attractive . They used some of
                    the new fabrics the Pakistani women were trying to develop and sell. They found
                    in the church building all the relics, things that were museum pieces. They
                    educated themselves on Pakistani archeology and became quite experts. They
                    produced, really, in a very quiet, very low key, never mentioned kind of way, a
                    charming museum which hadn't been there before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to ask you, in all these volunteer efforts, did

                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: No, they were working always with Pakistanis. The refugee camps were run
                    by the Pakistanis, so they worked with them. The crafts shop was all Pakistani
                    except for some American women who were married to Pakistanis and living in the
                    country; there was a group of them. In the school, we were working exclusively
                    with Americans. In view of the problems we had, we did not invite anybody else
                    to join in the school. We had enough problems of our ow(laughing heartily)
                    without anything else. We had no Pakistani teachers, we were just using the
                    women who were at the post at the time. I think those were the major
                    projects.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But interesting ones, really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: Well, I thought so. People were so involved in what was happening in
                    Pakistan, what was happening in the school. It was not self-centered involvement
                    just with the post or just with post families. That happened with the school
                    group, but otherwise people were deeply involved in what was happening in
                    Pakistan and trying to move it forward. It was a very stimulating time, and the
                    friendships we made there have been lifelong friendships. I think the
                    friendships you make are the people with whom you work, more so than in social
                    connections and so forth. If you work together then you become good friends.
                    Remember, we've just had another “Pakistani Party” — we've been talking the 50s
                    and this is 1990! Once a year this Pakistan group tries to get together, 40
                    years later. These were all teachers in the school, came to know each other so
                    well, like each other so much.</p>

                <p>WHITMAN: It doesn't. That's what I'm saying. Leadership came from off center. It
                    came from David Bell of the Harvard group. It had nothing to do with the post.
                    As a matter of fact, David Bell's group were quite sticky in not wanting to be
                    involved with the Embassy group at all. They didn't want to be seen as Embassy
                    parties, they didn't participate in Embassy parties. They felt that their
                    strength would be their independence of the Embassy in long-range planning, so
                    they never were involved. But they were a very intelligent, very interesting
                    group of people.</p>
                <p>The DCM's wife was involved with a totally different group. In Pakistan there
                    were minority peoples. Zubin Mehta the symphony orchestra conductor is a member
                    of one such group, I can't recall its name. This is a minority group in Pakistan
                    which was very influential. They had money, were highly educated, owned the
                    hotel and the movie house, and so forth. The DCM's wife was very much involved
                    with that group, which was another important area though it was largely social.
                    She was also, I think, involved in the arts/museum project, not taking any
                    leadership role in the school.</p>
                <p>You see, it doesn't really work the way you assumed. It was a spontaneous thing
                    from within the group itself. It was just the few wives who got the school
                    started. We undertook to be sure that we could pick up for the school everybody
                    whom we needed and who had any talent for the school, then we incidentally led
                    them into other directions if we couldn't use them in the school. This is really
                    what happened and it had nothing to with ambassadorial or State Department
                    leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting that this is the second example I have
                        recorded of leadership coming from, as you say, off center. That wasn't
                        really a crisis situation in Pakistan but it could have been one if the
                        women hadn't had anything to do, and hadn't been involved. It would have
                        been horrible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: It was terribly hot. We had one air conditioner for the master bedroom
                    and I think we were rather privileged. When we left two and a half years later
                    other families were getting a little air-conditioning, but there was absolutely
                    nothing to do and no place to go. And yet, it turned out to be everybody's
                    favorite post. Just because of involvement.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>I think this is what's so seriously lost now. There isn't any feeling, or I don't
                    sense any feeling, on the part of the wives that involvement is the way to go.
                    You're not supposed to be “involved,” you're supposed to be concerned with your
                    own individual careers, what you were doing back home. You don't necessarily see
                    a post as an opportunity for new ways of involvement, new things to learn, new
                    experiences to have. I don't sense that there is much emphasis on that now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still I sympathize with the wives in two respects. When
                        one looks at the cost of housing, and the cost of educating children now,
                        and competing in a two income world, really. Most of the bright young
                        couples in Washington, like our bright young Foreign Service people, who are
                        here all the time, they both have careers, they have two incomes. And you
                        need it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: You do. And so they're feeling oppressed all the time because they don't
                    have the second income abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think they must feel a little out of the
                        mainstream.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: Oh I'm sure that's true. I was struck not so long ago in meeting a lot
                    of young Foreign Service wives at a party: you say that they're out of the
                    mainstream at home but I felt that the Foreign Service offered the most
                    extraordinary opportunities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh I did too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: Extraordinary opportunities. I met this nice young woman who had just
                    divorced her husband. He had been head of the CIA in Iran at some point — this
                    is quite a while ago — but she felt that she had been very much imposed upon. He
                    was always bringing home people from lunch unexpectedly, always asking to have
                    lots of entertainment in the house, and so forth. She felt she was just being
                    imposed upon. So I said, “Tell me, what are you doing now?” “Well, “ she said,
                    “I'm working for an S&amp;L in Bethesda.” Now she's in the mainstream! (she
                    laughs heartily) But the difference between her life as wife of the head of the
                    CIA in Iran, and living alone and working for an S&amp;L in Bethesda — (she
                    breaks up) I would say was quite considerable. And I don't really understand why
                    these women don't see that when they have enormous opportunities to see the
                    people who are leading the world, who are making changes in the world, who are
                    affecting policy, and they can entertain them in their own home. And they have a
                    chance to know their wives, come to know their families — that strikes me as
                    being quite “mainstream” itself. This little job with an S&amp;L in Bethesda
                    ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't understand that myself.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>WHITMAN: I don't know, I think there has to be a positive look at their
                    opportunities in the Foreign Service. I'm talking about spouses now, their
                    opportunities in the Foreign Service, new learning opportunities, new
                    participation opportunities, new this, new that. And make it a very positive
                    thing. I think we've been put on the defensive for a very long time and that we
                    shouldn't be on the defensive. You don't have to oblige them to give tea parties
                    and coffee parties and things. If they want to do that that's fine, but somehow
                    emphasize that they are a part of the picture. What has happened to them now is
                    they're not part of the picture, they're totally out of it. Nobody expects
                    anything from them, nobody's going to ask them to do anything, they can just sit
                    there and talk to themselves for the next four years. And they're in very bad
                    shape because of that. I think you have to find ways for involvement.</p>
                <p>I couldn't think how to end that thing and it's not ended properly now, but
                    somehow the post has to emphasize opportunities for involvement in those
                    countries and I'm not sure how that would work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reason I asked earlier about the great involvement in
                        Pakistan and the women working with Pakistanis is because there are some
                        countries that don't want us to volunteer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: Oh yes, there's not question about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then that puts the woman in a real bind, it really
                        does. And then of course what they're dealing with today that we didn't deal
                        with is the fortress mentality because of security.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: Which is awful, just horrible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I would question in a situation like that, should they
                        really be there? If there really is a security risk, maybe it would be
                        better — it would certainly save us a lot of money — if we just sent an
                        Officer over on an 18-month tour and not subject the families to that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: It's possible...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it could be that things are changing because of
                        communication and Fax-in(she laughs) — I mean, you can get a written
                        document from here to there in seconds now. Maybe we don't need all of that
                        representation abroad.</hi>
                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hate to think that that's the case, I'm not endorsing
                        that at all. Because I think we did a great deal in our traditional role. We
                        did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: We did, we did a tremendous amount. And it's still there to be done, I
                    think. I was in Yemen last summer. The more primitive country you could not
                    find, it does not exist. So what was happening? Well, we went to the Embassy
                    parties and there gathering night after night were the same women who were
                    allocated to a room because most of them were Arabic and they didn't want to mix
                    with the men. The women were all there talking to each other night after night,
                    except for some of these Arabic women who really didn't have anything to talk
                    about and you could just sit by their side in silence. You could see how deadly
                    a post that could be.</p>
                <p>The husband of my next door neighbor is the Ambassador and she does not go to the
                    post. She stays here instead, and has a job, although they don't exactly need
                    the money, but however, she enjoys it more. On the other hand, here was a group,
                    all their children were in this school — an international school I guess it was
                    — so they sat around in evenings talking about how bad the school was without
                    ever making a single gesture to do anything. They were driving the Ambassador
                    right up the wall because they would fuss, fuss, fuss about this school. He was
                    so mad he was about to close it, (laughing) he felt if you don't like it, do
                    something about it. There was just a feeling of sort of inertia. Somebody else
                    was supposed to do what was needed to be done about the school. It must be
                    somebody else's problem, especially the American Ambassador. What was he going
                    to do? The whole Diplomatic Corps was coming to these parties — we went to two
                    or three of them and you could see the same people coming night after night, and
                    all of their children were in this school, the only school there was. So, there
                    are still opportunities for involvement. But they would be limited, I would say,
                    in Yemen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I found at our last post that any wives who weren't
                        employed felt that if they went out and did the volunteer work while
                        everyone else was being paid, they were being taken advantage of. I wonder
                        if that mentality doesn't exist now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: It very much does exist, very much. In this little paper I gave you, I
                    give a definition of happiness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I saw that. I think this is very good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: I think that the definition of happiness needs to be kept in mind.
                    That's one reason, I think, that that money is never going to be satisfactory.
                    It'll never be enough, it'll always be a source of contention, a feeling that
                    it's demeaning because it's so little. “Back home what I could have done” —
                    etcetera etcetera. So, although I'm not opposed to trying to get some money for
                    these women, I don't think it'll solve anybody's problems or make anybody
                    happier at the post.</p>

                        to give her recognition was to have her in her husband's Efficiency Report

                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: What was crystal clear to I think women in my era is that even though we
                    were included in the his Efficiency Report, it really made no difference on your
                    husband's career.</p>

                <p>WHITMAN: Yes, that's right. And being recognized for that. But it didn't make any
                    difference in what happened to the husband.</p>

                    has been involvement of some kind. Something that is so interesting for me that

                    principal of that school. I knew nothing about Education. I went down to the
                    USIA library and just spent days there, I read every book on education the USIA
                    library had imported, down one shelf and into another. I learned from that most
                    of it is just trash we're saying about education. It is so flimsy, s(groping for
                    adjective) unstructured, so poor.</p>

                <p>WHITMAN: Yes but we were looking for standards for grades, for standards for
                    arithmetic for third, fifth, ninth grade and so forth. You couldn't get that out
                    of any of these books on education, they were full of garbage. Theory. So
                    boring, and so useless. You know, if you were looking, if you were taking a
                    teacher who'd never taught before and were putting her in charge of fourth
                    grade, you jolly well had to come out at the end of the year that represented
                    fourth grade at home so that the child could move to the fifth grade when he got
                    home. You couldn't fool around with all this theory. You had to have something
                    very substantial to go on. So we did find some things substantial to go on. And
                    people who had never taught before found this one of the most interesting things
                    they ever did. The money was nothing. $l00 a month we got.</p>

                    General, he issued something that came to be known as “Crockett rockets.” These
                    were something somebody was supposed to do somewhere along the line. These left
                    his desk an(almost unable to speak for laughing) frequently flowed from one desk
                    to another until they reached bottom in the basement level. I would pick up on
                    Crockett's rockets, there was no place else for them to go. One of the rockets
                    was that we needed a “retirement book.” He had seen something that had been
                    issued by one of the departments which was “The Law and Retirement” or “You, the
                    Law and Retirement,” something like that. And he thought how interesting that
                    somebody's doing something about retirement. So I picked up on Crockett's
                    rockets because nobody else wanted to, that is for sure, and began to explore
                    the subject of retirement — something that I had never thought about before.You
                    could hardly believe it but in the 70s there was almost nothing written on
                    retirement. Nothing! I went to all the libraries in town and you couldn't find
                    any guidance or role model or anything else to follow. There was a woman writing
                    a book in New York on the same subject. She and I commiserated with each other
                    and she used mine and I used hers. In any case I produced this book, and it was
                    a good seller so we produced it three different times. It was always the same
                    pamphlet but we gave it three different names and we updated it. So that this
                    project, this Crockett rocket retirement pamphlet, went on and on. And when I
                    left the Department, they gave me a contract to rewrite it for the third
                    time.</p>
                <p>This gave me an opportunity to — but the emphasis in the pamphlet, again, was on
                    involvement in retirement. What are you going to do with the time? What can you
                    do that will be interesting? So I talked about all the kinds of opportunities
                    that there were for retirees in employment, but largely also in volunteer work.
                    So, I had talked to the Volunteer Clearing House and all these other agencies
                    over the phone and never had time to go out and talk to them personally; we got
                    all the stuff we could from the telephone conversation. But when I was finally
                    retired, I thought here was a good chance for me to go around and really see
                    what these places were all about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughing) See if it's all I said it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITMAN: Right. And one of the places I interviewed was the Volunteer Clearing
                    House. They were just established: they had one desk, one telephone in a big
                    bare room in that library that's at about 22nd and Pennsylvania Avenue. Just
                    starting out, they were trying to put a board together, and one thing that
                    happened at that point was that we had the first recognition for volunteers in
                    the Washington metropolitan area. So they asked me if I would head that up,
                    which was interesting.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I had never been interested, really, in volunteer work. My mother was very
                    heavily involved in leadership ways in Chicago. She said, “Don't get involved in
                    this volunteer work, you should work for a living.” She really didn't even want
                    me to be married, she thought it would be so interesting to have a career.
                    “Feminism” didn't really start with Betty Friedan, it started with my
                    grandmother, and my mother. They were very interested in independence for women
                    and so forth.</p>
                <p>So, I had not ever paid any attention to volunteer work. I was so amazed at what
                    was going on in this city with volunteers. I was touched to tears, I couldn't
                    believe the activities, the successes people had, the impact they were having on
                    the society, the effect on change in social policy that these volunteers had.
                    They saw a problem, just as my mother had, in her era. They saw a problem, they
                    started a committee, they produced a program. In Chicago in those days it became
                    a neighborhood project, it became a city project, then a county project, then a
                    state, then became a national project when we got Franklin Roosevelt. This is
                    how change occurs in the society, and I was suddenly thrown into with this
                    Volunteer Recognition Day and discovered how much was happening in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>So I was enormously impressed. Anyway, this was a connection with the Volunteer
                    Clearing House. They were looking desperately for board members in order to form
                    this organization, so they said, “You be Vice President” and I said, “Okay, I'll
                    be Vice President.” Very shortly after that the President decided she'd go back
                    to work, so that's how I became President right away. (both laugh heartily) It
                    was a very interesting experience. We were looking for funding, we got accepted
                    by United Way, we developed a lot of interesting projects and programs. I found
                    it a very interesting job, so I was in it for about six years. Yes, it's the
                    happiness.</p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>SUE WHITMAN - MARCH 9, 1990</p>
                <p>The March 1990 AAFSW News highlights the continuing frustrations among Foreign
                    Service wives regarding their role in the Service, and their dissatisfaction
                    with some of the proposed solutions, such as tandem couples, functional
                    training, residence manager, unless paid.</p>
                <p>Was it so different, I wonder, in the 50s when many of us felt blessed to be in
                    the Service, though keenly aware of the State Department's then indifference to
                    our status and negligible assistance in helping us cope abroad.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I wonder if the answer lies in a definition of happiness. And for this I look to
                    Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the University of Chicago Professor of Psychology
                    and Education, who has devoted his career to the understanding of life
                    satisfaction. What makes it? Who enjoys it? He concludes that happiness comes
                    from such deep involvement in an activity that nothing else seems to matter, an
                    activity so compelling that one does it for the pleasure of doing it. Such an
                    activity might be a challenging job or mountain climbing, bringing up children
                    or learning snorkeling, a science experiment or building a house.</p>
                <p>Involvement was surely the reason for the satisfaction many of us felt in Karachi
                    in the 50s — a post which by any normal standards had few if any pluses and
                    innumerable problems. It was hot, hot, hot with very little air conditioning.
                    There were water and food problems. The shopping center was two blocks long. The
                    one escape was the beach. But access to that crossed the open sewer leading to
                    the sea. There was no place else to go.</p>
                <p>The factor which changed life for all of us was the sudden huge expansion of the
                    American colony for which little preparation had been made. The Embassy itself,
                    a huge AID mission, a large Military Assistance Group, a Harvard group to help
                    with long range planning, all poured American families into Karachi. Pakistan
                    was then about eight years old.</p>
                <p>The school was the major problem. There were 60 school age American children when
                    we arrived, around 250 two years later. The State Department was not providing
                    schools, or even money for education at that point. We were on our own.</p>
                <p>We kept track of every arrival, and thus began the informal interviews to
                    identify the talents and interest of every wife. Wives interviewed wives. What
                    could they contribute to the post? What did they like to do? How could we
                    trigger their involvement in Karachi?</p>
                <p>The school we developed — kindergarten through four years of high school —
                    absorbed the largest group of wives. Compensation was $100 a month. Many had
                    never taught before but were willing to try, had ideas of their own how to teach
                    art, math, music, reading, hadn't liked the way it was done where they came
                    from. The school used the Calvert system for the grades and a similar university
                    based system for high school, so there were standards for every class every day.
                    However, the intelligence, sophistication and dedication of the moms who were
                    doing the teaching would have been hard to match anywhere.</p>
                <p>For those who weren't absorbed into the school, there were innumerable projects
                    which needed help. The refugee camps were appallingly short of food, water and
                    medical services. A large contingent of women worked daily mixing dried milk in
                    their washing machines for distribution in the camps. They helped the sparse
                    medical personnel and developed social services.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Other wives interested in the arts joined a group of Pakistani women to help them
                    with a shop the group had opened to sell Pakistani fabrics and to develop
                    saleable crafts.</p>
                <p>Others helped redesign the Karachi Museum, using the new Pakistani fabrics,
                    researching the artifacts they found scattered around the church which housed
                    the museum. They themselves became experts in Pakistani archeology.</p>
                <p>Still others made successful efforts to know the Pakistani women who were
                    involved in family planning, education, social services and health, and
                    introduced them to the rest of us. The new country of Pakistan was eager to
                    learn and to move ahead in every direction.</p>
                <p>This self activating post influenced the children who themselves devised numerous
                    programs with minimal adult assistance — a school year book, snack shop, style
                    show, art projects and a Christmas pageant using live camels and sheep and a
                    nomad tent on a piece of the desert near the school. The need for discipline and
                    psychological problems was rare.</p>
                <p>It was the absorbing involvement of so many in community projects in Karachi that
                    led to high morale at the post in the 50s.</p>
                <p>I am not sure how this relates to present day foreign service life. Does each
                    post explore and formalize opportunities for involvement? Is the focus on the
                    needs of the embassy family or on the community at large? Is recognition given
                    to wives who make a significant contribution to the community? Which of the
                    proposed solutions to wives' frustrations qualifies for consideration under our
                    definition of life satisfaction?</p>
