                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Rountree it's a great privilege for me to have
                        this opportunity to converse about your incredible Foreign Service
                        career—one of the most distinguished of recent years. If we could begin at
                        the beginning, we're interested in how you got interested in foreign affairs
                        and how you entered the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: My first employment with the United States Government was with the
                    Treasury. And in the course of my work in the Treasury, I was put on a task
                    force to set up the system of accounting for lend/lease funds which were later
                    appropriated by the Congress, and organizing methods for the procurement of
                    supplies by the various departments of the Government. When we completed our
                    task and the Lend/Lease Act was passed by Congress, I was asked to remain in the
                    Office of Defense Aid Reports which was a forerunner of the Lend/Lease
                    Administration. I did so and became involved in our program of giving aid to our
                    friends engaged in World War II. At the time of Pearl Harbor, I decided to leave
                    the Lend/Lease Administration and apply for a commission in the Army. When I
                    discussed this with Lend/Lease Administrator, Edward Stettinius, and his Deputy,
                    Tom McCabe, they asked me to delay my application because they wanted me to
                    undertake a mission to Cairo to join the British in the Middle East Supply
                    Center. At that time the British organization was engaged in the provision of
                    essential supplies to Middle Eastern countries and stimulating new production in
                    the area to contribute to the war effort. Initially I was asked to go over for
                    six months, after which Mr. Stettinius agreed to consider my application for the
                    Army.</p>
                <p>I went to Cairo in 1942 as the Assistant to Fred Winant, who was the principal
                    American representative on the Middle East Supply Center, and became engaged in
                    activities throughout the Middle East. Our area of responsibility was
                    essentially that of the Office of Near Eastern Affairs in the Department of
                    State, but included also the Sudan, Ethiopia and Iran. After six months I
                    received telegraphic instructions to remain for another six months. And so it
                    went for the duration of the war.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>When I left Cairo after my work with the Middle East Supply Center, I met for the
                    first time Loy Henderson, who at that time was the head of the Office of Near
                    Eastern, South Asian and African Affairs and told him of my intention to leave
                    the Foreign Service. Loy dissuaded me from this course and pointed out that the
                    United States, by virtue of our leadership in the free world, had to assume far
                    greater responsibilities in the Middle East than before. Before the war, United
                    States interests in the Middle East had been limited, but with the reduced
                    influence and capacity of the British and French, a vacuum would be created
                    unless the United States engaged more actively in Middle Eastern Affairs. The
                    Service urgently needed officers with area experience, and my war-time service
                    had uniquely qualified me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can I just ask here if before you went to Cairo, had you
                        had any special interest in foreign affairs or the Middle East or were you
                        planning to practice law or stay in the Treasury Department, have a
                        Government career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Before talking with Loy, I considered my options to be either to return
                    to the Treasury and remain a Government official or accept an offer in private
                    industry, which I was also seriously considering. My pre-war interest in foreign
                    relations was that almost of the average informed citizen. I followed
                    international matters closely, but I had never given thought to joining the
                    Foreign Service. This all came about, in my case, because of my experience in
                    the Middle East and my involvement in many matters of international importance
                    during the war.</p>
                <p>I think my decision to remain in the Foreign Service, while not taken until I met
                    with Loy Henderson later, might have begun to germinate when, for example, I
                    went with Alexander Kirk who was our Minister in Cairo and accredited also to
                    Saudi Arabia, and lived in King Ibn Saud's tent camp for a period of five or six
                    days during which I negotiated with the King's ministers the first lend/lease
                    agreement with his country. This first agreement with the Saudi Arabs was for a
                    limited amount of supplies, primarily trucks. The agreement was undertaken at a
                    time when Saudi Arabian financial resources were extremely limited. The budget
                    was met primarily from revenues derived from pilgrims coming to Mecca,
                    supplemented by a grant of about $10 million a year, as I recall, from the
                    British. The negotiations took place while American oil facilities were being
                    prepared in Dhahran and nearby areas, but before oil production was actually
                    begun. And so the appreciation of the Saudi Arabs for our supplies was far
                    greater than would have been the case when oil revenues began to flow in
                    substantial volume.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>In those days, Arabian costumes were worn when one entered the interior of the
                    Saudi Kingdom. We did so, and lived in colorful tents near the King who in
                    theory was there to hunt, but in fact was too weak to engage in this kind of
                    sporting activity which he had enjoyed in his earlier life. Ibn Saud had never
                    left the Arabian Peninsula and was quite uneducated, yet he was an
                    extraordinarily intelligent man. To me, the most fascinating aspect of our visit
                    was to sit in the King's tent and listen to conversations between the King, who
                    often spoke in parables, and our Minister, Alexander Kirk, who was an eloquent
                    speaker and one of the most interesting conversationalists I've ever known. It
                    was extremely rewarding for me to witness at first hand the Saudi Arabian scene,
                    the manner in which the King and his ministers operated, and to recognize the
                    vast differences between the sophistication of United States governmental
                    policies and procedures and those of Saudi Arabia. I became intrigued by these
                    differences and considered how fascinating it would be to pursue a career in
                    diplomacy.</p>
                <p>One of the interesting aspects of the conversation between King Saud and
                    Alexander Kirk was the King's description of his success in overthrowing his
                    predecessor regime, the Hashemites. This was ultimately achieved by a night
                    raid, scaling walls and destroying the enemy. The King told us, in some detail,
                    of the battles to obtain power, and Kirk commented that he had understood that
                    the King had always ridden a white camel. The King confirmed that was so,
                    whereupon Kirk commented that white camels were magnificent beasts. The King
                    said, “Oh you like white camels, Mr. Minister?” Kirk replied, “Oh yes, I think
                    they are....”. He then realized his comment might be interpreted by Saudi logic
                    as suggesting that he would like to have a white camel. He went to great pains
                    to dissuade the King from any such notion. Nevertheless, the following morning
                    the King's aide, a gentlemen by the name of Rushty Bey, called on me in our
                    tents to say that the King had ordered a camel parade after our breakfast. We
                    would assemble at a certain spot when the camels could be driven by so that the
                    Minister could make his selection. They had rounded up all the camels in the
                    neighborhood. It was my assignment to persuade Rushty Bey that there was no way
                    we could convey a camel back to Cairo on our return trip. Finally he understood
                    this, but nevertheless in an exchange of gifts Kirk was given two gazelle, which
                    we did, in fact, take back on the C-47 which had brought us to Bahrain.</p>
                <p>During the course of my assignment to Cairo I visited all the countries of the
                    area and learned a great deal about each. I also became aware of the problems
                    which would confront them after the war. And so by the time I was prepared to
                    make a decision at the conclusion of my service in the Middle East, I think I
                    was strongly disposed to the Foreign Service as a career and I accepted Loy
                    Henderson's offer to become his Special Assistant and Advisor for Economic
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was certainly an incredible introduction to the
                        Middle East, that tour in Cairo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now what year did you enter the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I entered the Foreign Service in 1942. It was appropriate that I go to
                    Cairo as a Foreign Service Auxiliary Officer since I would be doing more than
                    Lend/Lease work. When I returned to Washington and undertook my first assignment
                    in the Office of Near East/South Asian and African Affairs, I reverted to Civil
                    Service status, which I retained for a relatively short time before becoming a
                    career Foreign Service Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, one of your first duties after entering the
                        Department of State after Cairo, as I understand it, was to serve as the
                        Executive Officer on the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine
                        which President Truman and the Prime Minister of England had appointed to
                        recommend steps for what to do, not only in Palestine but about the Jews in
                        Europe as well. Could you tell us a little about the work and the make-up of
                        that committee and the forces driving it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: The committee consisted of six distinguished Americans and six
                    distinguished British. They were supported by a staff of some twenty people,
                    both British and American. The committee first held hearings in Washington, DC,
                    in the old State Department building, now the Executive Offices of the
                    President, over a period of about two weeks. We then went to London where
                    hearings were held for about the same period, going from there to Europe where
                    the committee as a whole or individual members visited many of the Jewish
                    refugee camps in various countries. From Europe we went to Cairo where more
                    hearings were held, and then by train to Palestine where we remained for a
                    month. Through these hearings and visits the committee was able to obtain the
                    diverse views of many organizations and individuals interested in the future of
                    Palestine, and to study in-depth the background of this most complex problem.
                    After Palestine we proceeded to Lausanne, Switzerland where the members spent a
                    month reviewing the testimony and absorbing the information that had been
                    collected from various sources. Slowly, recommendations to the British and
                    United States governments evolved. The report, when completed, was delivered by
                    the chairman of the British component to the Prime Minister, and by the chairman
                    of the American delegation to President Truman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the American chairman?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Joseph C. Hutchison, a distinguished Federal judge from Texas. The
                    committee endeavored to draw up a balanced set of proposals. It was the
                    committee's concept that the proposals arrived at should entail acceptance of
                    all, since the balance involved give and take on both sides of the issue.
                    Fairness and objectivity would be destroyed if only selected recommendations
                    were adopted. Unfortunately, the first proposal, that is that 100,000 additional
                    Jewish immigrants be permitted to go into Palestine, was immediately accepted by
                    President Truman and an announcement to that effect was promptly made. At no
                    time did the balanced recommendations receive the kind of consideration, on
                    either side, that could have rendered successful the mission of the
                    Anglo-American Committee. And so, the practical results from the work of the
                    committee was extremely limited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The British accounts of the committee and the aftermath—as
                        you say the Zionists seizing what they liked, the Arabs taking what they
                        liked and no one agreeing to everything—the net result it seems, from the
                        British point of view, was that the United States because of the political
                        pressures and all involved, really walked away from the Palestine problem
                        and left it up to the British to do what they might. Do you think that's a
                        fair account?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I think, in effect, that is what happened on the American side. I'm not
                    sure that the opposite occurred on the British side. But in any event, the
                    recommendations of the committee were not accepted when they were presented, and
                    with the course of events in Palestine, probably could never have been accepted
                    at a later date.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, even at that time, your opinion was pretty much that
                        events had moved too far against partition against either a Jewish or Arab
                        state in Palestine, that events had gone too far at this late date?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: As a practical matter, they had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that the committee had all the expertise on
                        the Middle East, the members of the committee that would have been
                        desirable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I think, on balance, there was adequate expertise. In some cases there
                    was not adequate objectivity among specialists, but I do not believe that was

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One related issue to this since the committee was to look
                        at the fate of the displaced persons, the Jewish people in Europe in
                        addition to Palestine, a charge that has frequently been made is that while
                        the United States pressed very hard for the 100,000 and continued Jewish
                        immigration, but in fact we did very little in the United States, in the
                        Congress particularly, to open the immigration gates of the United States to
                        bring as many of these displaced persons to the United States at the time—a
                        kind of reverse pressure for Jewish immigration to Palestine. Do you
                        think...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I don't recall the statistics of the number of European Jews who came
                    to the United States but an appreciable number did, and there is no question
                    that the desire of most of the Jews in Europe was to go to Israel. The main
                    objective of the Jewish immigrants was to find means of getting to Israel and,
                    of course in addition to the 100,000 recommended by the Anglo-American
                    Committee, there were many other thousands who by other means and other doors
                    achieved that objective and were there at the time of the war and the
                    establishment of the Jewish state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alfred Lillienthal, in his book “What Price Israel”,
                        alleges that at this very time prior to the creation of Israel, the American
                        Jewish organizations made no effort, no lobbying effort, no testimony before
                        Congress on the immigration laws to open the door and I've never been able
                        to substantiate that one way or the other. What about, at this same time,
                        the other issue or allegation, report, that every United States Ambassador
                        in the Middle East recommended against the American support for the creation
                        of a state by Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I think it's true that opinion in the Foreign Service favored extreme
                    caution in decisions to be made with respect to Palestine, so the interests of
                    the Arab Palestinians would be taken into account in the final decision. You
                    recall at the time the independence of Israel was proclaimed, the new state was
                    recognized almost immediately by the United States, the Soviet Union and many
                    other countries. I think it would be fair to say that the overwhelming majority
                    of Foreign Service personnel, both in Washington and in the field, felt that
                    consideration should have been given to the future of Palestinian Arabs before
                    the decision to recognize Israel was announced. Not that there was opposition to
                    recognition itself, but there was concern that it be done in a manner that would
                    have the least detrimental effect upon the United States influence in the Middle
                    East and take into account the legitimate interests of the Arabs of Palestine.
                    It is evident that our failure to do so has cost us dearly in the Middle
                    East.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Getting away from the Arab-Israel conflict for the moment,
                        it seems from your biography that the period from 1947 through 1955, really
                        a period of eight years, was pretty much devoted to Greece, Turkey and Iran
                        in various capacities, including service in the field in all three of those
                        countries. Could you say something about the main issues beginning with
                        Greece and your participation in the economic delegation that led to the
                        Truman Doctrine?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: During the course of my assignment in the Office of Near East/South
                    Asian and African Affairs, I was appointed a member of the special mission sent
                    by President Truman to survey Greek requirements in connection with the Truman
                    Doctrine. The British informed us that, because of their own financial problems,
                    they would have to withdraw support from Greece. At that time Greece was engaged
                    in a bloody civil war. Their economy was a disaster. It appeared quite possible,
                    if not probable, that in the absence of American aid Greece would fall victim to
                    the tremendous efforts of international communism to take over the country. When
                    the British informed us of their decision to withdraw, there was very limited
                    time, we calculated, to organize alternatives to save Greece.</p>
                <p>The President appointed Paul A. Porter, a distinguished lawyer in Washington, to
                    head a delegation to make a survey, to talk with the Greeks, and see in the
                    first place whether Greece could be saved and, if so, how. We spent some weeks
                    in Greece studying the situation and formulating our conclusions and
                    recommendations. Meanwhile, Washington had proceeded with legislation providing
                    a new departure in American policy. The Truman Doctrine, as you know, was
                    essentially a decision that it would be the policy of the United States to
                    extend aid to countries needing and requesting such aid that were being
                    threatened by international communism. The reaction in Congress to this was
                    overwhelmingly favorable, and initially a sum of $400 million was appropriated
                    for aid to Greece and Turkey. Turkey was included since it also was being
                    subjected to heavy communist pressures, in this case, pressures in the form of
                    Soviet demands with respect to the Kars-Ardahan province of Turkey and control
                    of the Turkish Straits. $300 million was earmarked for Greece, for both military
                    and economic aid, and $100 million for Turkey.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Following the appropriation of the money, the President appointed former Nebraska
                    governor Dwight Griswold to head the Mission to administer the program in
                    Greece. A staff of highly competent people was organized to assist him in this
                    work. A small American military advisory group was organized under the direction
                    of General Van Fleet to handle, under Governor Griswold's direction, the
                    military aspects of the program. At that juncture the military aspects were
                    extremely important because the Greeks needed aid and advice to coping with a
                    very difficult guerrilla war, which at times it appeared they were losing. After
                    Governor Griswold and his mission had been in operation in Greece for a few
                    months, it became evident that having two Ambassadors in Greece was leading to
                    some confusion. There was doubt as to who articulated American policy and who
                    had responsibility for various facets of our operations there. Ideally, the same
                    man should have occupied both positions or clearly have authority and
                    responsibility for all aspects of American operations in the country. To resolve
                    the problem, the President appointed Henry Grady, both as Ambassador to Greece
                    and as Chief of the American Mission for Aid to Greece. When Ambassador Grady
                    went to Greece, because of my deep involvement in the Greek aid program from
                    Washington, I was asked to go as his Special Assistant for Politico-Economic
                    Matters. A Senior Foreign Service Officer by the name of Burton Y. Berry was
                    appointed in a similar capacity as Special Assistant for Politico-Military
                    Matters. We were the two officials assisting Ambassador Grady in his overall
                    capacity, neither in the Mission nor in the Embassy.</p>
                <p>After the program had been in operation for a year, many of the obstacles first
                    encountered were either resolved or on the way to resolution. A particularly
                    favorable development occurred when Tito decided to defect from the Soviet Bloc.
                    An immediate effect was that the border between Yugoslavia and Greece was closed
                    to the Greek guerrillas and thus their maneuverability was greatly restricted.
                    They theretofore had been free to strike, retreat across the border, regroup and
                    come again at some unpredictable place. So militarily the situation came under
                    control and economically Greece was at least held together.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there any author or authors of the Truman Doctrine or
                        was it pretty much a bureaucratic consensus thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Of course, full credit must be given to President Truman, whose
                    foresight and courage made this one of his most important decision. I think if
                    there were another author of the Truman Doctrine, it might perhaps be Loy W.
                    Henderson who headed the staff work leading to the proclamation. However, I
                    think that that would not be correct because of the deep involvement of many key
                    people in the State Department, including Secretary Marshall, Under Secretary
                    Acheson, Chip Bohlen and others.</p>

                <p>ROUNTREE: I don't recall specifically, but many fine officers participated in
                    this establishment of a new departure in US foreign policy. After the
                    legislation passed, the most active officer in the Department in its
                    implementation was George C. McGhee, who was designated Coordinator of Aid to
                    Greece and Turkey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it recognized at the time that the far reaching
                        interpretation of the Truman Doctrine that it later took on that it really
                        kind of applied across the world, rather than just to Greece and
                        Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: The real significance of the Truman Doctrine was exactly that. We
                    embarked on an entirely new policy. The decision here was the forerunner of the
                    Marshall Plan in Europe. The success of the Greek-Turkish Aid Program, I think,
                    stimulated many other efforts in the Truman Administration, such as Point Four
                    Program and the expansion of bilateral and multilateral treaty arrangements with
                    many countries in various areas. All of these things taken together were the
                    most significant aspect of our ability to cope with Soviet expansionism.</p>
                <p>During the course of my assignment to Greece, I was asked to return to Washington
                    to become Deputy Director of the Office of Greek, Turkish and Iranian Affairs.
                    The first director of that newly-created office under a reorganization plan was
                    Jack Jernegan. The newly-designated Bureau of Near Eastern/South Asian and
                    African Affairs under George C. McGhee, included, for the first time, an office
                    to deal with Greece, Turkey and Iran, all peripheral to the Soviet Union. The
                    reason for that is obvious. Those were the countries directly confronting the
                    Soviet Union which had been subjected to the greatest pressures. They had a
                    number of points in common as far as the execution of US policy was concerned.
                    Jack remained as Director of the Office of Greek, Turkish and Iranian Affairs a
                    few months after I returned, and in May 1950 I took over as director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were Greek-Turkish relations a big problem in those
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: In those days relations between Greece and Turkey did not constitute a
                    major problem but, of course, historically relations between the two countries
                    have never been close. During my period as director, I took on a special project
                    to bring about the entry of Greece and Turkey into NATO, an objective which had
                    the full support and participation of my boss, George McGhee. It seemed to me
                    that the strength in NATO was diminished by the absence of those two countries,
                    and that logic required their inclusion. This view was very strongly held by
                    George McGhee as Assistant Secretary and was strongly supported by the Turkish
                    and Greek Ambassadors in Washington. After considerable effort on our collective
                    parts, Greece and Turkey were admitted and, for some time after their inclusion
                    in NATO, relations between the two countries were quite good. It was only later
                    when events in Cyprus created concern on the part of the Turks that Enosis—or
                    union of Greece and Cyprus— might take place that severe strains again
                    appeared.</p>

                        next post was as DCM in Ankara for a little over a year anyway. Were there
                        any big issues by that time during your assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: In Turkey my superior officer was again George McGhee, who left the
                    position of Assistant Secretary of State in 1952 to accept an appointment as
                    Ambassador to Turkey. I joined him as the Deputy Chief of Mission soon after his
                    arrival at the post. I think the most significant aspect of his term of office
                    there, and mine, was facilitating the effective entry of Turkey into NATO, and
                    the negotiation of new agreements dealing with military facilities. The
                    importance of our aid to Turkey, and our continued support for the Turks in
                    building up their defense capabilities and improving their economy as a member
                    of NATO and as an ally became increasingly important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those early years of the Cold War and given the
                        importance of those countries, what were the relations like within the
                        Mission, say with the military, between the Embassy and the military aspect
                        with the Pentagon, with the Economic Cooperation Administration? In other
                        words, the interagency working. Were the State Department and the Ambassador
                        pretty dominant at that period, or more like it is today with some of the
                        other agencies, particularly the military, being dominant?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I mentioned the problem in Greece before the decision was made to put
                    all of our operations in Greece under the direction of a single man, the
                    Ambassador. Once that was done in Greece, interagency relationships were better
                    than good, they were excellent. And although there were inevitably differences
                    of opinion among Washington agencies as to priorities and so forth, I would say
                    in retrospect that difficulties were within very manageable proportions and
                    relationships did not impair the effectiveness of our overall effort. In Turkey,
                    during my tour of duty there, I think we had an almost ideal relationship among
                    the country team, and there were relatively few differences among the Washington
                    agencies. We had a strong and influential Ambassador, as well as able
                    representatives of the military and other government departments. So I'd say
                    that unlike the situation which no doubt has existed in some countries, our
                    interagency problems in Greece and Turkey during this critical period were
                    minimal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it's because there was a strong consensus
                        about what our policy was or did it also have to do with a predominant role
                        that the State Department had under General Marshall, under Acheson, under
                        Dulles, or a combination?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I think it's all those things. There were very few differences among
                    agencies with respect to the main thrust of American policies and certainly we
                    were all operating under the direction of the President who was, as indicated by
                    the Truman Doctrine, deeply interested in and instrumental in the execution of
                    policies to achieve the objectives which he had set.</p>

                <p>ROUNTREE: During my earlier period as Director of the Office of Greek, Turkish
                    and Iranian Affairs, Mossadegh rose to power. The political situation in Iran
                    had been very shaky for several years. You might recall the unsuccessful
                    negotiations between Prime Minister Razmara and the British, with the Iranians
                    endeavoring to amend the terms of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Agreement. Finally, the
                    assassination of Razmara added to the turmoil within Iran. A series of Prime
                    Ministers were appointed by the Shah, including his closest confidant, Hussein
                    Ala, but none succeeded in establishing stability and an atmosphere conductive
                    to successful negotiations with the British. During this tumultuous period
                    Mossadegh, who had always been in opposition and never in power, attracted an
                    increasingly wide audience and supporters. The Shah finally felt compelled to
                    turn the government over to Mossadegh, and I think it was the Shah's general
                    expectation that Mossadegh's inability to come to an agreement with the British
                    or to organize the economy would bring about his early departure. This was not
                    to be the case. Mossadegh's hostile attitude toward the British was manifested
                    in many ways. His unwillingness to meet the British half way became evident. We
                    became increasingly concerned over events in Iran and endeavored in every
                    possible way to be instrumental in bringing about a resolution. President Truman
                    asked Averell Harriman to go to Iran and try to serve as a catalyst to bring
                    about a resumption of negotiations between the British and the Iranians. I went
                    with him and we spent several weeks in Iran, during which he held many talks
                    with Mossadegh. He finally persuaded Mossadegh to receive a British delegation,
                    which was promptly dispatched to Tehran. Various proposals were discussed but
                    all were unacceptable to Mossadegh, who seemed quite adamant in his position
                    that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company would not return. So the Harriman mission
                    left without any substantial progress. The Iranian economy continued to
                    deteriorate. Continued sporadic efforts to find some means of resolving the
                    problem were unsuccessful and it was in this atmosphere that Mossadegh came to
                    Washington for a series of discussions with the President and other officials in
                    Washington, but they also were without concrete results.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Shortly after Mossadegh's visit to Washington, both George McGhee and I left for
                    Turkey. While I was in Turkey various interesting events occurred in Iran, one
                    of which was an effort to unseat Mossadegh, in which CIA was involved. This
                    failed and the position of the Shah became untenable. He was forced to leave
                    Iran for Italy. After his departure, however, an almost spontaneous revolution
                    occurred on the streets of Tehran. It began with a public demonstration by a
                    health club—or exercise club—lifting barbells and chains and that sort of thing.
                    These clubs often demonstrated on the streets. But on this occasion they began
                    shouting anti-Mossadegh, pro-Shah slogans and proceeded to march through the
                    streets. Many others joined them, and soon there was a substantial demonstration
                    in favor of the Shah and against Mossadegh. Shouts of “Long live the Shah”
                    spread throughout the city and the crowd went in the direction of the building
                    housing the Mossadegh cabinet. Meanwhile General Zahedi, who had been one of the
                    principal figures in the earlier attempt to overthrow Mossadegh, came out of
                    hiding and he and other military officers gave leadership and direction to the
                    mobs on the street, and they succeeded. I might say, parenthetically, that one
                    of the reasons for the relatively easy success was that Loy Henderson, who was
                    our Ambassador in Tehran, had complained bitterly to Mossadegh about harassment
                    of Americans on the street by communists and other of his followers. He said
                    that if this continued he'd have no alternative but to order the evacuation of
                    Americans from Iran. This Mossadegh did not want and he instructed his people,
                    including the communists, to stay off the streets. After this tremendous
                    demonstration had gained momentum it was too late for the communists and other
                    Mossadegh followers to offer any effective opposition. The result was the
                    success of the pro-Shah, anti-Mossadegh demonstration, or revolution, and the
                    members of the Mossadegh cabinet were seized. Mossadegh himself, after initially
                    escaping the crowds, was seized but treated far more gently than his
                    associates.</p>
                <p>At this point a situation was created in which the Shah could return. He did so,
                    and appointed General Zahedi as Prime Minister. This created an entirely new
                    situation in Iran. I was asked to transfer directly from Ankara to Tehran and
                    become Deputy Chief of Mission under Ambassador Henderson. I think this was
                    because of my previous experience as Director of the Office of Greek, Turkish
                    and Iranian Affairs in which position I handled various matters relating to the
                    problems of Iran. Ambassador Henderson's former Deputy had recently left, and I
                    was delighted again to be working with Loy, who had become my close friend as
                    well as mentor.</p>
                <p>The main objectives when the Shah returned were to reestablish order, get the
                    economy going again and, very importantly, effect the return of the British
                    Diplomatic Mission, which had been expelled by Mossadegh, and the beginning
                    negotiations which would permit the resumption of Iranian oil production.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get on to that, if I'm understanding you
                        correctly, what you're saying is that the CIA has gotten a lot of undeserved
                        credit for bringing back the Shah and that they really didn't play a
                        significant role.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Oh, I don't think it was undeserved. The CIA did remarkably well in
                    creating a situation in which, in the proper circumstances and atmosphere, a
                    change could be effected. Mind you, they had been working with General Zahedi
                    and his people. Quite clearly the matter did not work out as they had
                    anticipated, or at least hoped, but it did work out in the end, and I wouldn't
                    deprive them of credit for playing a major role if indeed they sought credit.
                    However, it is clear that the responsibility for and the success of the
                    revolution are due to Iranians. Our people could only supplement the efforts of
                    others with the approval of the Shah, and could not replace such efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Turkish attitude toward Mossadegh at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I don't recall any notable aspect of Turkish attitudes toward Iran
                    during this period. Relations between Turkey and Iran during the period were
                    acceptable and the Turks continued to work with the Shah in the context of the
                    Baghdad Pact, but I don't recall any particular demonstration of favorable or
                    unfavorable attitudes at the time of the counter-revolution which effected the
                    Shah's return.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about our American thinking at the time? Was the
                        Mossadegh nationalization and his alliance or use of the Tudeh party, was
                        this Iranian revolution seen primarily in the context of the Cold War and a
                        possible Soviet encroachment into Iran or was the Iranian nationalist
                        movement seen as the primary force? How were we looking at the Iranian
                        revolution at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: From the outset there was no hostility by the United States toward
                    Mossadegh. We were not fundamentally opposed to Mossadegh. We were, however,
                    deeply concerned by his inability to work out an agreement with the British, and
                    get the oil revenues again flowing. We were concerned about the state of the
                    Iranian economy, the extent to which Mossadegh had resorted to the printing
                    press to meet all financial needs. There had been predictions early in his
                    administration that the Iranian economy would collapse within six months. Well,
                    it didn't collapse, and it probably would not have collapsed in a considerable
                    period of time because of the unique character of the Iranian economy and the
                    ability to survive in circumstances which would have been catastrophic for many
                    other countries. There was a reversion to a primitive type of economy. We
                    actually undertook various types of programs to help the Iranian government
                    under Mossadegh. This included a Point Four Program and a willingness to provide
                    Export/Import Bank loans. We were anxious to avoid an economic catastrophe in
                    the Mossadegh regime.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>I think most people recognized that the situation in Iran would be highly
                    precarious until Mossadegh or someone could find a means of resuming oil
                    production in conditions acceptable to the international oil market. Even if
                    they could produce the oil, companies and not countries are for the greatest
                    part the customers, and so long as Iranian oil was produced under the onus of
                    expropriation, big companies which would normally provide the markets for the
                    product were unwilling to take it; thus the economy suffered. We made every
                    effort through the Harriman mission, through discussions with Mossadegh when he
                    came to Washington, through continuous efforts of our Embassy under Henry Grady
                    and, more recently under Loy Henderson, to find the means of rendering the sale
                    of Iranian oil acceptable to the international community. But all of these
                    efforts failed, and it seemed to us that stability in Iran would require a
                    change in government; that Mossadegh simply should not continue
                    indefinitely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the role of the American oil companies? Surely
                        they were very upset by the precedent that Mossadegh's nationalization set
                        in Iran and what it would mean for their concession throughout the Middle
                        East.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: They were indeed upset. American oil companies were initially unwilling
                    to even consider replacing the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. This was a matter of
                    principle. It was a matter that concerned them as businessmen. They were also
                    aware of the likely effects which the successful expropriation of oil facilities
                    would have on their own interests elsewhere. After the Shah returned it was
                    clear that there was no possibility of a return to the status quo ante, that is
                    the return of Anglo-Iranian. It became increasingly clear that the best
                    alternative would be an international approach to the operation of the Iranian
                    oil industry under arrangements acceptable to the British. American firms were
                    not waiting to jump in. The first step in the world's most complicated business
                    negotiations was to achieve the agreement of the American firms among themselves
                    to become a part of an international consortium. You can imagine the difficult
                    negotiations involved in even this one of many steps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the British quite willing to accept them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: The second aspect was discussions and agreement between the Americans
                    and the British with respect to the circumstances under which Anglo-Iranian Oil
                    Company would relinquish its claims in Iran. Negotiations between the five
                    American oil companies and the British, Dutch and French companies were held to
                    complete the international consortium. In order to preclude the appearance of
                    unfair practices, a percentage of the consortium was made available to smaller
                    American oil companies. My recollection is that this amounted to five
                    percent.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>After completing their negotiations, the consortium then sat down to negotiate
                    with the government of Iran. We were very fortunate in many respects, one of
                    which was that Loy Henderson was an excellent negotiator in setting up the
                    arrangements for the consortium meetings with the Iranian negotiators. Secondly,
                    the Administration obtained the services of Herbert Hoover Jr. to help
                    facilitate the negotiations. He came to Iran and remained throughout the
                    negotiations. He was invaluable. Thirdly, the negotiating team designated from
                    the consortium members, was excellent, and was headed by an official of the
                    Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey, Howard Page. Page represented the consortium as
                    a whole—at least he was the principal consortium representative and was
                    surrounded by many officials from other companies. He proved himself to be
                    extraordinarily able. Finally, the Shah and his government desired to find a
                    reasonable and politically acceptable solution which would permit the early
                    resumption of oil revenues. After a period of a good many months this rather
                    incredible agreement was reached, thanks to the outstanding qualities of the
                    negotiators.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the US Government role in all of this a promotion, I
                        mean a normal kind of promotion, protection of American interests, in the
                        interest of American oil companies? Or were there serious differences of
                        opinion between the US Government and how it saw its larger interests and
                        the American oil companies, or were they basically together in negotiating
                        with the British and with the Iranians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: The US Government role in this matter could best be described as one of
                    facilitating agreement among the various parties concerned. Naturally, our
                    interest in the protection of American firms is always there. Once the momentum
                    was created and the basic decisions made, once it became clear that the US
                    companies were comfortable with their prospective roles in the consortium, among
                    themselves and with the British, Dutch and French firms, then special interests
                    were substantially lessened. To a much greater extent the negotiations were
                    between the consortium and the government of Iran, and whatever arrangements
                    they were able to make would likely be agreeable to the United States
                    Government. Throughout this whole process we had the advantage of having Herb
                    Hoover there to help, to advise, to assist. He was very helpful.</p>

                        for the oil companies to work, collude together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I don't remember the exact legal framework in which this was done, but,
                    yes, this was always borne in mind. I don't remember what instrument was issued
                    or what policy statement was made, but at no time were the oil companies
                    operating contrary to US law or contrary to any established policies in the US
                    Government.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the remaining period of your tour in Iran through
                        October 1955, what kind of relationship, if any, did the Embassy have with
                        the religious establishment in Iran—relations with the Ulema, if any?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Our relations were limited, although we did make an effort to keep in
                    touch with all elements in Iran, particularly the leaders of various groups. I
                    met on several occasions with religious leaders. Separately and always quite
                    privately, other members of the Embassy staff did so on a more regular basis. At
                    that time, the importance of religious leaders in Iran was extremely limited.
                    The Shah was at times rather undiplomatic in his relations with the religious
                    leaders opposing his regime. Iranian authorities left no doubt in the minds of
                    the diplomatic corps that they felt the religious leaders presented no present
                    or potential problems in Iran. In retrospect, the Shah clearly underestimated
                    this aspect and did far too little to understand the hopes and aspirations of
                    religious elements.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: It was one of the most interesting assignments that I had in my Foreign
                    Service career. Most of the efforts of the embassy during my period there,
                    either as Deputy to Ambassador Henderson or, following his departure, as Charg�
                    d'affaires were concentrated on economic matters, the resumption of oil
                    revenues, the implementation of development programs, including our extensive
                    Point Four Program, and, generally, efforts to undo the vast damage that had
                    been done to Iran and the Iranian economy under the Mossadegh regime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Shah at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: The Shah was, during that period, filled with renewed confidence. He
                    felt that he had the backing of his people. He displayed a new determination to
                    carry out his development programs formulated over a period of years with the
                    help of a group of American specialists. The Shah was a courageous man, and his
                    intentions were superb. But as one of our previous Ambassadors to Iran
                    commented: “In Iran good intentions sometimes pave the road to hell”. His
                    capacity to organize the government to carry out programs, and to choose the
                    right people for the right jobs, was obviously limited. As a result, much of the
                    progress that could have been made faltered. Later, the Shah concentrated
                    heavily upon military matters and, in the opinion of most, expended far too much
                    of Iran's resources on the military. Apart from that, on the whole, Iran had a
                    leader that in the right circumstances could have brought the country forward
                    from their economic depression. He made a lot of progress, but obviously not
                    enough.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I think there is no doubt that corruption in Iran was one of the major
                    problems that the Shah should have coped with but did not.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you returned to Washington for a period of almost four
                        years, serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near East and Africa, then
                        Assistant Secretary and then Africa gets carved away in August 1958, but
                        those were a period of years full of very significant events. Let's start
                        with the 1956 Suez War and the US role, what it knew, when it knew it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: As you indicated, I returned to Washington toward the end of 1955 as
                    Deputy to George Allen, who at that time was Assistant Secretary for Near
                    Eastern/South Asian and African Affairs. Later, when I succeeded George Allen in
                    1956, we were engaged in an assortment of crises throughout the region. One of
                    these, of course, was the Suez War and its aftermath. We had, during my term of
                    office, some 28 crises of various sorts—difficulties between Greece and Turkey
                    over Cyprus; the Iraqi revolution; the landing of American Marines in Lebanon to
                    prevent an overthrow of the government by outside elements; disputes among the
                    Arabian Peninsula sheikhdoms; quarrels between Pakistan and India over Kashmir;
                    territorial differences between Pakistan and Afghanistan; difficulties between
                    Iran and Afghanistan over the Helmand River; and the crisis in Iran itself, a
                    continuing crisis over a period of years. All of this in addition to the
                    longstanding Arab-Israel conflict.</p>
                <p>During this period there were virtually no crises in Africa except for the war in
                    Algeria, but there was continuing concern with respect to the emerging states on
                    that continent and how the United States could most effectively use its
                    influence to achieve peaceful transactions from colonial status to independence.
                    When I took over there were a hand-full of independent countries in Africa, but
                    there were literally dozens of territories and colonial areas on the road to
                    independence. This deserved more personal attention and thought to the continent
                    of Africa than anyone engaged in the crises of the Near East and South Asia
                    might provide. Part of the problem was met when I appointed a special Deputy for
                    African Affairs. But I felt the continent deserved and should have the undivided
                    attention of an Assistant Secretary dealing with the problems of Africa at the
                    Bureau level. Therefore I proposed, and Secretary Dulles readily agreed, that we
                    should ask Congress to approve the creation of a separate bureau and the
                    appointment of an additional Assistant Secretary. There was no opposition to
                    this, but both houses of Congress did not complete necessary action for some
                    time. We nevertheless proceeded with the creation of a separate African bureau
                    and until an Assistant Secretary was finally appointed, I continued both as
                    Assistant Secretary for the Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, and Assistant
                    Secretary for African Affairs.</p>

                        period, by the European Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: No, African affairs always were handled primarily by the Bureau of Near
                    Eastern and South Asian and African Affairs. My Deputy for African Affairs
                    devoted full time to that Bureau, until the official appointment of an Assistant
                    Secretary. That appointment was delayed, unfortunately, for a period of time
                    because of the difficulty in obtaining confirmation for the first nominee. Time
                    was required for the selection and installation of a successor. Now, turning to
                    the Bureau of Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we do that, could you just say something about the
                        relationship then between your Bureau and the European Bureau over the
                        African questions? Was that a problem? It must have been, I'm sure it was
                        with Algeria, for example, but in some of the other African countries was
                        there a bureaucratic conflict of interest between the European Bureau and
                        the African Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Naturally, there were some problems of coordination between various
                    bureaus sharing an interest or responsibility, but there were no unusual or
                    unique problems between my Bureau and other officials of the Department dealing
                    with Europe. I emphasize, however, that in many matters close coordination was
                    necessary and I think with few exceptions this presented no unusual
                    problems.</p>
                <p>One of the first Middle Eastern crises with which I was confronted, first as
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary then an Assistant Secretary, was the Suez War. As you
                    know, relations between Nasser's Egypt and the United States had deteriorated.
                    There were sharp differences between us. At one point it appeared that matters
                    might improve as a result of our willingness to assist in financing construction
                    of the Aswan Dam. Agreement between the United States, the World Bank, the
                    British and Egypt on the Aswan Dam appeared likely. Then a number of events
                    occurred, including Nasser's changed attitude toward the Soviet Union, and his
                    acquisition of vast quantities of Soviet military goods. This entailed the
                    commitment of Egyptian resources for years to come for payment of the military
                    equipment. This not only changed attitudes, it changed the evaluation of the
                    ability of Egypt to meet the cost of the Aswan Dam and at the same time service
                    its debts otherwise acquired.</p>
                <p>Attitudes were changed also as a result of various unconstructive statements and
                    threats emanating from Egypt. Members of Congress had serious doubts about the
                    wisdom of the United States engaging in this in the then existing circumstances.
                    Secretary of State Dulles was warned by particular Senators and Congressmen that
                    they would oppose the US proceeding. In any event, the collective judgment in
                    the United States government was that we should not proceed, and information to
                    that effect was communicated to the Egyptian Ambassador in Washington by
                    Secretary Dulles.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say it was a collective decision? I can recall hearing
                        at the time that the people on the Egyptian desk, for example, heard about
                        it in The New York Times. In other words, the impression was that it was a
                        unilateral sort of decision by Dulles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: No, I don't think that is correct. I was present with Dulles when the
                    decision was made. I was also present at meetings with the British and officials
                    of the World Bank, as well as at the meeting at which the decision was
                    communicated to the Egyptians. All of this information was conveyed by me to my
                    staff as it occurred. So no official of the Bureau should have had to rely on
                    The New York Times or any other outside source for knowledge that this had
                    indeed been the decision.</p>
                <p>There were people both within the United States Government and outside, including
                    the World Bank, who would have preferred to proceed with the loan, and disagreed
                    with the decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this reevaluation of Nasser that took place within the
                        US Government at your level, at that time did the Lavon Affair play any role
                        or was it taken into account?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: The reaction in Egypt was sharp, and the subsequent decision by Nasser
                    to seize the Suez Canal created a sharp counter-reaction in the United States,
                    Britain and various other countries using the Suez Canal. All of our economies,
                    and particularly the economies of our NATO allies, relied upon oil coming
                    through the Canal. We consulted with the British and French and others as to
                    what should be done in the circumstances following the seizure of the canal.
                    There were some who felt that no option should be eliminated and, if necessary,
                    the military option should be exercised. We were deeply concerned over the
                    premature reliance on force, and gave most urgent thought to more practical and
                    workable alternatives. Secretary Dulles personally conceived of the idea of a
                    Suez Canal Users Association which would provide a mechanism for countries to
                    whom the free passage through the Suez Canal was important, getting together and
                    applying pressure for arrangements under which free and safe passage through the
                    Canal could be assured. The Secretary telephoned me from his Push Island retreat
                    to tell me of his idea and ask that we urgently consider the possibilities. This
                    seemed one of the relatively few peaceful recourses available at the time. Mr.
                    Dulles no doubt felt that, in the absence of some peaceful approach, military
                    action on the part of some friends and allies would be inevitable.</p>
                <p>And so various conferences with the British, French and other users of the Canal
                    were arranged. Great efforts were made over a period of months to put this
                    mechanism into place. Perhaps it was doomed from the beginning as a result of
                    Nasser and Egypt's refusal to go along. In any event, it didn't work, but it did
                    succeed in at least postponing the day of military action.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>The Suez War was the direct result of the closure of the Suez Canal and the
                    failure of what was perceived to be the best non-military alternative. We had
                    not given up hope, and were working very hard on peaceful alternatives to
                    resolve the problem. At one point communications between the British and
                    ourselves, the French and ourselves and the Israelis and ourselves were reduced
                    to a level which caused questions as to what was going on. I received
                    intelligence reports indicating an enormous increase in communications among the
                    British, the French and the Israelis. At the same time there were reports of a
                    substantial buildup in Israeli forces. We came to the conclusion that the three
                    countries were preparing for a military option. I recall my first conversation
                    with Secretary Dulles on this possibility. After listening to my recitation of
                    the evidence, he talked with the President and urgent messages were sent to the
                    Prime Ministers of Great Britain, France and Israel, strongly cautioning against
                    military action. The Israeli military buildup continued throughout the next day,
                    and a second letter was sent to Prime Minister Ben Gurion, as well as to the
                    British and French. Following this second message to Ben Gurion, I received an
                    urgent visit by the Israeli Ambassador Abba Eban, one of the most able and
                    eloquent diplomatic representatives I have known. Ambassador Eban was obviously
                    upset. He said that if we had only called him in to discuss our concern he could
                    have reassured us that there was no significant military buildup in Israel.There
                    had been a localized buildup to meet a particular situation, but Israel had no
                    intention whatsoever of invading Egypt. During the course of our talk, one of my
                    associates in NEA, Fraser Wilkins, handed me a UP ticker. The ticker read,
                    “FLASH-FLASH-FLASH, MAJOR ISRAELI FORCES HAVE INVADED EGYPT AND HEAVY FIGHTING
                    IS UNDERWAY.” I handed this to Ambassador Eban and commented that he no doubt
                    would like to return to his Embassy and find out what was going on in his
                    country. It was perfectly obvious that Eban had no indication of a military
                    buildup or planned invasion; he was flabbergasted.</p>
                <p>As you know, the initial invasion was by Israel. According to the plan, the
                    British and French were to enter as the second phase, ostensibly to separate the
                    combatants and secure the Canal. All of this presented the United States with a
                    difficult and, in many respects, heartbreaking situation. I accompanied
                    Secretary Dulles to his meeting with the President to determine what our
                    reaction to this unhappy event would be. I was very impressed with the attitudes
                    of both of these gentlemen. Their decisions were based entirely on principle. It
                    was later in that day that Dulles made a statement in which he set forth our
                    reaction. He described this with what he said was a “heavy heart”, because we
                    would be opposing in the Security Council our closest allies and good friends.
                    Nevertheless, we would have to insist that the military be withdrawn.</p>
                <p>In the final analysis, the British, French and Israelis felt compelled to act in
                    accordance with the resolution, and the forces eventually were withdrawn.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>One of the incidental effects of these events was to convince Nasser that the
                    United States was not the devil that it had been thought to be. He recognized
                    that we did, in fact, act according to principle. The affair, as sad as it was,
                    served to mellow his attitude toward the United States and create something of a
                    new situation in which more reasonable and realistic negotiations with him and
                    his government could take place. And I would say that in the ensuing
                    period...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In addition to the point you made about improving
                        relations with Nasser, letting him know we acted on principle, what were
                        some of our other rationale that we used with the British and the French and
                        the Israelis against the use of force in the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: There were many considerations, one of which was we did not think that
                    force would achieve the long-term objectives which we sought. We felt that force
                    would present complications, not only in Egypt but throughout the area, that
                    would render our collective positions far more difficult. We had not exhausted
                    the opportunities or the possibilities of a peaceful solution. Although people
                    were not elated with the results of the Suez Canal Users Association approach,
                    there were still other peaceful approaches that could and should have been
                    pursued.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think Mr. Dulles saw this crisis primarily in
                        US-Soviet terms or did he very much see it in terms of Egyptian nationalism
                        and the Middle East?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Mr. Dulles was a very wise man, one of the finest Secretaries of State
                    in this century. Certainly, he and Dean Acheson would qualify for that
                    distinction. I don't believe any single element, such as the effect on US-Soviet
                    relations, was responsible for his decision and his attitude. There were various
                    facets, including the effect on any possible solution to the Arab-Israeli
                    problems, as well as our relations with Egypt itself, that were weighed in this
                    decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another major event that took place during your period as
                        Assistant Secretary was the demise of the Baghdad Pact as a result of the
                        revolution in Iraq in 1958, but could you say something about the Baghdad
                        Pact, the origins of the Baghdad Pact, the rationale for it, why the United
                        States didn't join?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: The United States was not a party to the creation of the Baghdad Pact,
                    although from the outset the members had hoped that we would join. It was a
                    concept of other countries, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and Britain. Many of us were
                    not convinced that the Baghdad Pact could be an effective counter to the UAR and
                    other collective approaches to political objectives in the Middle East.
                    Nevertheless, the members felt that it could be, and placed a lot of credence in
                    the concept. Certainly, we shared the objectives of the Baghdad Pact and made
                    clear our support, but in the final analysis at every meeting of the
                    organization we declined to become a member. Among other things, US membership
                    in the Baghdad Pact would have rendered our effectiveness in dealing with
                    certain other countries in the area, more limited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't the Baghdad Pact more directed at containment of
                        the Soviet Union than the other direction—I mean its concept?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: The concept included both and that was one of the problems of US
                    membership. It was not purely and simply, a collective effort to defend the
                    members against international communism, that is the Soviet Union. This was one
                    of the fuzzy aspects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role did you play in the decision in 1958 after the
                        demise, after the coup in Iraq, in the decision to land the Marines in
                        Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: The revolution in Iraq was an extremely bloody affair in which the
                    royal family and all members of the government not only were killed but were
                    mutilated. It occurred, of course, at a time when Jordan and Iraq were actually
                    negotiating some sort of amalgamation of their military force under a union
                    countering the UAR between Egypt and Syria. It seemed clear that Jordan and
                    Lebanon were placed in grave danger, and there was a genuine concern on the part
                    of the government of Lebanon that the blood spilled in Iraq would flow into
                    Lebanon. There was similar concern in Jordan.</p>
                <p>Before the Baghdad coup there had been a period of relative quiet in the Middle
                    East, that had encouraged me to take the first vacation that I'd had since I had
                    returned to Washington in 1955. My wife, daughter and I had driven down to
                    Atlanta. We actually drove into the city about 8:00 in the morning. I turned on
                    the car radio and heard about the Baghdad revolution, and when I arrived at my
                    relatives' residence I was told that Washington was trying to get in touch with
                    me. I called Secretary Dulles and he said that a plane was standing by at a
                    naval station in Atlanta to bring me back. And so, having arrived at 8:00 in the
                    morning, I left at 8:30 to return and joined the top level of the State
                    Department and other agencies in considering the implications, not only of the
                    Iraqi revolution but elsewhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The decision to move military forces into Lebanon came at the most urgent request
                    of the President and Government of Lebanon. They felt that in the absence of
                    such an action on our part Lebanon would be confronted with major crisis and
                    possible disaster. Again, all aspects of this were considered and it was decided
                    to respond. The details were worked out with very great care and in consultation
                    with other countries. The British, having close treaty relationships with
                    Jordan, decided to respond to the King of Jordan's request for assistance. The
                    decision having been made, the operation was carried out, I believe, in an
                    almost flawless manner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was that decision made? The President made it in a
                        meeting, or over the phone, or with Secretary Dulles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Of course, the President made the decision. Although I don't recall the
                    details, and even whether I was present when he did so, it would have been after
                    seeing Secretary Dulles and other appropriate Cabinet officials. In any event,
                    it was a personal decision on the part of the President based on the
                    recommendations of Secretary Dulles with the concurrence of the Secretary of
                    Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and others. I don't recall any opposition to
                    the decision. At discussions related to the implementation of the decision in
                    the most effective possible way, there were, of course, inputs from many
                    sources.</p>
                <p>As we moved the Marines into Lebanon, the Administration went to great pains to
                    make clear that they were there for a very limited purpose and when that purpose
                    had been served they would be withdrawn. There were a lot of skeptics in the
                    Middle East. Many Arabs felt that this was a mere ploy—that US forces would stay
                    as long as it served US interests—but we were meticulous in making the statement
                    and then acting upon the assurance as soon as the mission was completed. It's
                    certainly my evaluation that the decision was an excellent one. It probably
                    saved a disaster in Lebanon, and perhaps also in Jordan. Our withdrawal as
                    promised was a source of surprise and reassurance to skeptics, not only in the
                    Middle East but elsewhere, who felt that we had motives other than those which
                    we had stated. On the whole, it was a very successful operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's your opinion of the role Ambassador McClintock
                        played in that crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Ambassador McClintock did an outstanding job in keeping Washington
                    informed on all aspects of developments in Lebanon. He was very effective in his
                    meetings with the Lebanese officials, before, during and after the decision was
                    made. He was particularly helpful to the military forces when they arrived and,
                    indeed, accompanied the commander in the lead car as the Marines moved into
                    their positions in Beirut. So his performance was, in my judgment,
                    extraordinarily good.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Rountree, during your period as Assistant
                        Secretary, what kind of relationships or contacts did you have with the
                        so-called lobby that is the Zionists or the Zionists lobby in Washington?
                        How did they affect our Middle East policy, if at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I think that individual Jews and most Jewish organizations go to great
                    lengths to express their views, both to officials in the Administration and to
                    members of Congress. As the years have passed, the extent of lobbying
                    organizations has grown and become more scientific. At no time since the
                    establishment of the State of Israel has any issue affecting to any important
                    degree the interests of Israel been considered in Washington without an input of
                    the Jewish lobby. For example, before any appropriation for aid was considered
                    by the Administration and Congress during my term of office, there would be a
                    slate of Jewish leaders visiting the Secretary of State, the Under Secretary of
                    State, the Assistant Secretary of State and other offices concerned with such
                    matters to urge the position of the government of Israel. The effectiveness of
                    this lobby has certainly increased since my years in the State Department, and
                    probably is the most extensive lobby existing in Washington today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the American oil companies? Were they active in
                        direct relation with you or what kind of impact did they have on Middle
                        Eastern policy during those years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: American oil companies have had, particularly since World War II,
                    considerable investment in the Middle East and, therefore, a great interest in
                    US policies and operations in the region. They maintain an appropriate level of
                    contact with the State Department, and exchange information of mutual interest.
                    In the case of oil companies, it has never been a one-way street. We are able to
                    benefit from their experiences and their knowledge of particular problems. It
                    has been a useful type of relationship which should exist between any business
                    firm with an interest abroad and diplomatic representatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would it be fair to say that during that period, anyway,
                        that the American Government didn't see any contradiction in the interest of
                        the oil companies and the interest of the United States in the region—that
                        they were very parallel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I can't say positively that there has never been a contradiction or a
                    conflict of interest, but offhand I can't remember any. Nor do I recall during
                    my term of office that either I or others in the State Department were pressed
                    to take action or assume positions that would be inappropriate.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another question, this relates to one of my few sort of
                        scoops in the Foreign Service. I went to call on the head of the G2 in
                        Aleppo, Syria, the United Arab Republic at the time, on January 1, 1959,
                        Marwan Thebbi, and he told me that as part of a UAR-wide operation the night
                        before throughout Aleppo, Damascus, Cairo that the G2s government of the UAR
                        had arrested all the leading communists. And Aleppo, as fast as we could
                        work the “one-time pad” anyway, was one of the first to report this, which
                        of course the Egyptians wanted it out anyway. But I wonder what kind of
                        impact the crackdown, not just on this night but other times as well, the
                        crackdown on domestic communist parties in the UAR and Egypt particularly,
                        had in Washington, had on the thinking in Washington? And, of course, it's
                        something that happened not just in Egypt but in other countries where the
                        government seemed close to moving toward the Soviets but was very tough on
                        domestic communists.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Rarely were we concerned that any of the Arab countries, with one
                    exception, was moving dangerously close to accepting anything like a communist
                    ideology. Obviously, many of the Arab countries dealt with the Soviet Union,
                    traded with them, bought military goods from them, got political support from
                    them, but whenever such a relationship began to raise questions as to the
                    ideology of the Arab country, something always happened to demonstrate that they
                    were far from communist. Several incidents in which local communists were
                    slapped down tended to reassure us as to the basic commitment of the
                    governments.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The one exception in which we were deeply concerned was following the revolution
                    in Iraq. As you recall, the military leader of the Iraqi revolution became its
                    president. Qasim headed a government that was operating in rather difficult and
                    highly confused circumstances in which there were, as I recall, three elements:
                    One, a pro-UAR element which urged union of Egypt and Syria and a much closer
                    relationship with Nasser. A second element urged a closer relationship with
                    communists and with the Soviet Union. The third was that element of Iraqi
                    nationalists who felt they shouldn't be unduly tied to relations with the Soviet
                    Union, the communists or with the UAR. After this government had been in
                    operation for a while, a lot of people in Washington felt that the communists
                    were getting the upper hand and that our policies toward Iraq should be based on
                    the assumption that we either were then or would soon be dealing with a highly
                    unfriendly communist government. Some of us felt that this was not the case,
                    that the balance which I mentioned did, in fact, exist. And in order to test
                    this, I decided, with the Secretary's approval, to go to Iraq. My mission was
                    announced—I think it was December 1958—and I prepared to go first to Lebanon and
                    have talks with the President and Lebanese officials, then to Jordan for talks
                    with King Hussein, then to Egypt for talks with Qasim. This trip was announced
                    by the State Department and immediately thereafter the communists in Iraq, as
                    well as the Soviet Union and China, began a campaign obviously designed to
                    discourage the trip. The campaign became very heated during the time that I was
                    in Egypt talking with Nasser. There were signs across all the streets “ROUNTREE
                    GO HOME”. Every newspaper had the upper part of the front page devoted to some
                    slogan such as “ROUNTREE, DON'T DIRTY OUR SOIL” and so forth. Crowds had already
                    begun to appear on the streets and it was clear that this was going to be a
                    hostile reception, and clear also from the character of the buildup that it
                    would be a communist-led demonstration. I recall that when I talked with King
                    Hussein, he brought in his Chief of Staff who had gone through the Baghdad
                    revolution, had been seized himself and put aboard a truck to be hauled across
                    the town with other foreigners of various nationalities. People on the trucks
                    were grabbed one-by-one, dragged off the truck and cut into pieces. Greeks,
                    Britons and several other European nationalities were included. Finally they
                    hauled the Jordanian General off and started cutting him, but he fell to the
                    ground, crawled under the truck, through the legs of people on the other side
                    before they discovered his escape. He hid behind a wall where he became
                    unconscious until the crowds left. He survived and the following morning was
                    taken by a stranger to a hospital. These were the recollections of someone who
                    had gone through a horrible ordeal. His descriptions of the attitude of the mob,
                    of the hatred on the faces of children and so forth as they hacked away on these
                    bodies, were incredible.</p>
                <p>By the time I arrived in Egypt for talks with Nasser, the newspapers, including
                    Egyptian newspapers, had pictures of these mobs and signs. Nasser advised me
                    that it would be unwise to go. I sent a message to Washington reporting my
                    conversation with him. Washington consulted with our ambassador in Iraq who
                    talked with Qasim upon whom he placed the responsibility for my safety unless
                    Qasim asked me not to come. Qasim did not ask that the visit be canceled, and so
                    I went.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>When I arrived at the airport my plane was met by two truckloads of Iraqi
                    soldiers. One truck preceded the car in which I rode with the American Charg�
                    d'affaires and my Special Assistant who accompanied me on the journey, and the
                    other truck followed closely. Without any previous announcement, instead of
                    going out the front entrance where thousands of people has assembled, the convoy
                    went through a hole that had been cut in the fence. Nevertheless, enough of the
                    crowd got over to pelt us pretty thoroughly with rocks, tomatoes and any other
                    objects they might pick up. In driving to the city, we paused on the way for me
                    to sign the book at the Regency Council. This, unfortunately, gave the people at
                    the airport an opportunity to get downtown, and so the crowds to be passed in
                    the city grew to massive proportion. Thousands of people had us circled before
                    reaching the embassy. They had assembled a small herd of cows and as the lead
                    truck passed at a traffic circle, they forced the cows in front of my car.
                    Fortunately, my driver just shot right through them and knocked them out of the
                    way, otherwise my car would have been isolated there; the crowd had cut off the
                    follow truck. We were not stopped, and in passing the crowds I could see the
                    expressions on the faces of these people, including children, which bore out the
                    accuracy of the descriptions which the Jordanian General had given me. I'd never
                    seen human faces bearing such hatred. Now what they hated I'm not quite sure,
                    but having been there I know there are few things as unpleasant as a hostile
                    Baghdad mob. Actually note of that fact has been taken in Arab literature for
                    centuries.</p>
                <p>We reached the Embassy safely, and my evening was spent at dinner arranged by my
                    able host, Charg� David Fretzlar, and attended by most of the Iraqi cabinet. I
                    had the opportunity of having brief but informative talks with each of them.
                    Throughout the dinner, and for the remainder of the night, truckloads of
                    demonstrators passed the Embassy shouting their slogans. A small Iraqi army unit
                    stationed in the Embassy garden prevented them from stopping.</p>
                <p>The next morning I had to be transported by armored vehicle to the Ministry of
                    Defense for my meeting with Qasim. We got out of the vehicle in the courtyard,
                    where dozens of soldiers were stationed at random positions, assuring that all
                    visitors were not more than ten feet from the muzzle of a machine gun.
                    Proceeding up the staircase and through halls, we were never without this
                    coverage. Qasim was obviously a man of questionable mental competence. He had
                    the appearance of a highly unstable person. I was amused that he sat in a very
                    high chair and, like Hitler and Mussolini, had provided his guest with a chair
                    with sawn-off legs. I sat in this and was considerably below his level. But at
                    least we had a conversation, even though a soldier with a machine gun stood in
                    the middle of the floor between the four conferees.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>The main purpose of my mission was to persuade Qasim that contrary to communist
                    propaganda, the United States and Iran or Pakistan were not plotting a
                    counter-revolution. I don't know the extent to which this could be demonstrated
                    but it was my feeling that as a result of our concerted efforts, including this
                    mission and other means, he became reassured that we were not planning a
                    counter-revolution as the communists had charged. He felt comfortable in turning
                    away from support of the communist elements, and in favor of the nationalists
                    and the pro-UAR elements. That is one case where I felt that communists might be
                    on the verge of taking over in one of the Arab countries. My visit reassured me
                    that this would not be the case.</p>

                        of Sakiet Sidi Youssef in Tunisia because the French accused the Tunisians

                        you say something about our relations with France and the Algerian
                        revolution, or NEA's relations, I guess, or approach towards the Algerian

                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Most matters affecting the Algerian revolution were dealt with to a
                    greater extent by EUR than by NEA for the reason that Algeria, theoretically,
                    was a part of France. This is one of those cases I mentioned earlier where very
                    close coordination between the European Bureau and the African Bureau was

                    great elation on the part of the Arab world.</p>

                <p>ROUNTREE: In times of crisis, and when important decisions relating particularly
                    to my area were to be made, I would often accompany the Secretary to meet with
                    the President. I had developed a very great respect for Eisenhower and for his
                    fundamental attitude in setting American policies in the Middle East. Later,
                    when I was Ambassador in Pakistan, he came out for a visit and it was one of the
                    high points of my term as Ambassador in Pakistan, and also one of the truly high
                    points in US-Pakistani relations. It was an enormously successful and useful
                    visit.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Yes, I think he did. Of course, he relied heavily on Secretary Dulles.
                    President Eisenhower was an organization man and to me that was one of his
                    strengths, not weaknesses. He didn't have people around him outside the
                    organizational structure whispering in his ear, telling him to do this, that, or
                    the other thing. He had confidence in Dulles, and rightly so. He could rely on
                    the organization of the Foreign Service and feel confident that he didn't have
                    to know every detail about every problem.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Secretary Dulles, did he have a good
                        understanding, in your opinion, of the Middle East?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I think a remarkably good understanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know he was accused sometimes of seeing the world only

                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I don't think that was a weakness of Dulles. It's one of the aspects
                    that was taken into account in most decisions that he made, but certainly not to
                    the exclusion of other considerations. Dulles was criticized a great deal during
                    his term of office and much of the criticism was, in my judgment, unjustified.
                    You recall that he was criticized for all of his travels. In comparison with all
                    Secretaries who preceded him, he was a traveling Secretary of State. He traveled
                    no more than was essential in the circumstances existing at the time,
                    circumstances quite different from those which existed from all his
                    predecessors. The world had changed, communications had changed, diplomacy had
                    changed. It was no longer possible effectively to exercise the responsibilities
                    of Secretary of State while sitting in Washington. Many international
                    conferences were required, personal contact with heads of states, and so forth.
                    That was one area of criticism. Another one was he was a one-man Secretary of
                    State, that everything came out of his hat and he seldom consulted others. I
                    doubt that there is a Secretary of State in history who was more meticulous in
                    consulting his subordinates than Dulles. I know of no decision that he ever made
                    with respect to my area of responsibility in which I was not informed and
                    invited to participate. This went far beyond just the big questions. It
                    included, for example, advance consultation on the appointment of ambassadors.
                    Though this was obviously a courtesy, and he had no obligation whatsoever to do
                    so, he would never make a speech dealing with the part of the world for which I
                    had responsibility without our input and comment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another area in which I think he was criticized for was
                        his role, or his lack of a role, in the McCarthy period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Yes, and in that I cannot provide an adequate defense. Not only Dulles,
                    but I think the President and the Administration generally, initially and for a
                    good many months were very weak in resisting that kind of totally inappropriate
                    activity on the part of Senator McCarthy or any senator. I think that if I were
                    to evaluate the performance of Dulles as Secretary of State that is perhaps the
                    only significant area in which I would be less than complimentary. It's my guess
                    that if Dulles were to evaluate his own performance as Secretary of State, that
                    would be the area in which he would be self-critical.</p>
                <p>Dulles was criticized for being a hard man, an unfeeling man. He had the
                    appearance of a dour person, but I have never worked with anyone who was more
                    thoughtful and considerate. I used to work very hard in pressing situations,
                    sometimes for days without adequate rest. On several occasions, Secretary Dulles
                    called Suzanne at home and said, “Suzanne this is Foster Dulles speaking. I just
                    want to tell you that Bill has been working too hard and I want you to keep him
                    home this weekend”, or whatever.</p>

                <p>ROUNTREE: If I did something that particularly pleased Dulles, he wouldn't get on
                    the telephone and call me and say “good job”. He'd get up out of his desk, get
                    on the elevator, come down to my office, walk in and thank me. He really was a
                    great man.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: No one close to me professionally. I never met the man. I was never
                    involved in any of the nefarious activities going on in his bailiwick. I happen
                    to know such people as John Service and John Carter Vincent and Ambassador
                    Grady's son-in-law.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Yes, I do. It had a lasting impact on the individual concerned,
                    obviously, and I think for a period of time it discouraged the kind of frank
                    reporting that is essential if a Foreign Service post is to live up to its
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your relationship with other agencies in
                        Washington now that they are all getting more and more, of course you still
                        had Foster Dulles as Secretary of State who was an extremely strong
                        Secretary and you had Christian Herter, too, after he died. Were the other
                        agencies becoming more influential in policy matters yet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: During the Dulles Administration, Dulles was clearly the dominant
                    personality in foreign affairs, and he seemed to work with relative ease with
                    all other agencies of the Government. One factor, of course, in the Dulles
                    Administration was that his brother was Director of CIA, therefore coordination
                    with CIA presented no problem. Relations among agencies in Washington during
                    that period were extremely good. The effectiveness of this relationship very
                    often depends on the strength and influence of the Secretary of State. It's no
                    coincidence that coordination among agencies was better in the Dulles
                    Administration and in the Dean Acheson Administration than in most others.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Some Secretaries of State since Dulles have been among the finest people I've
                    known, awfully good people, but not necessarily strong people. The result has
                    often been that the kind of leadership in foreign affairs which ideally should
                    be exercised by the State Department was diminished. Presidents have different
                    methods of operating. President Eisenhower, as I indicated, was an organization
                    man. He depended upon his organization. If things went wrong he wanted to change
                    his organization or elements of the organization—not devise new organizations to
                    take their place. Other Presidents, beginning with Kennedy, felt that important
                    decisions could not be made down the line in the traditional organizational
                    structure, but had to be made in his office. Many were made in his office with
                    relatively little influence by professionals. Other Presidents also had their
                    own methods. A number operated foreign affairs from the White House or the
                    National Security Council. To the extent that this takes place, coordination
                    among the agencies is rendered more difficult and the influence of any single
                    agency, necessarily is limited.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you Ambassador Rountree for seeing me again to
                        continue your interview. First, I have two questions about the period we
                        covered earlier. One relates to a new book “The U.S.-Turkish-NATO Middle
                        East Connection” by George McGhee published just this year, in which he
                        provides evidently an account of how he led the campaign to get Turkey into
                        NATO with a lot of bureaucratic things, such as holdings a Chiefs of Mission
                        meeting in Istanbul. A reviewer, Dan Newbury, suggests that in his view the
                        main thing that got Turkey into NATO was the performance of the Turkish
                        Brigade in the Korean War which Ambassador McGhee does not dispute but he
                        does not highlight it either. If you could say something about your own
                        views on the importance of Turkey in the Korea War and the battle to get
                        Turkey into NATO in spite of the great cultural gap and all between Western
                        Europe and Turkey.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I have no doubt that the outstanding performance of the Turkish Brigade
                    was a favorable factor in considering the entry of Turkey, as well as Greece,
                    into NATO. But I believe that their admission to NATO would have been achieved
                    in any event in order to complete the membership of countries most logically to
                    be included. Certainly the performance of the Turkish Brigade was a favorable
                    factor and made George McGhee's work, as well as mine under his direction, much
                    easier.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: It might have been a factor in the minds of some of the members of
                    NATO, but I don't think such differences were of real importance. The overriding
                    importance of military and security aspects carried the day in the final
                    determination.</p>

                        Soviet Union was engaged in that period in a lot of “missile rattling”, as
                        it was called, and tried to take a lot of credit for the withdrawal and got
                        a lot of credit in the Arab countries. How important was the Soviet Union in
                        getting the forces to withdraw, and did we have any contact with the Soviet
                        Union during that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Of course, we had contact and followed with great interest the various
                    statements and actions of the Soviet Union. I do not believe that the credit
                    which you mentioned in the Arab states was all that extensive. Some Arabs gave
                    the Soviets credit for making a substantial contribution. I never thought that
                    Nasser, for example, shared that belief. Nasser had a rather realistic appraisal
                    of the extent to which the Soviet Union might influence events in the Middle
                    East. The Soviets sought and, from some quarters, received credit for making a
                    substantial contribution, but it was in fact a very limited contribution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In our communications with the Soviets, did we coordinate
                        or was there any real honest exchange of views with the Soviets about the
                        aggression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I don't recall the details of communication, but there was, of course,
                    contact with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in June 1959, you end your major service in
                        Washington and begin your Ambassadorial career which was a very long and
                        distinguished one. Just for the record, how did you first get appointed an
                        ambassador? What was the process? You were already an Assistant
                        Secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: After I had been in the Office of Assistant Secretary for several
                    years, I discussed with Secretary Dulles my desire, at his convenience, to go on
                    to other things. He very kindly said that he had hoped I would remain with him
                    for the remainder of his term in office; but he understood my desire to move to
                    the field. He discussed the possibility of an ambassadorial appointment,
                    mentioning specifically Pakistan. Later he said that he discussed the matter
                    with the President and they would be pleased if I would accept that appointment.
                    I was delighted, and accepted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Pakistan during a relatively stable period.
                        What were the main objectives of your mission to Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: You're quite right. My service in Pakistan happened to be during what
                    many people would consider to be the best period in Pakistani history. Ayub, who
                    had been Commander-in-Chief of the Army, had taken over in a bloodless coup and
                    had organized his government not long before I arrived. He brought to Pakistan a
                    period of stability and a sense of national direction which had been largely
                    lacking before he took over. Our relations with Pakistan during that period were
                    very good. We had one of our largest economic/military assistance programs in
                    operation in Pakistan. They were listening carefully to the advice of our
                    economic advisors and were making good progress in a number of fields. Generally
                    things were moving in a favorable direction. There was, of course, criticism in
                    the United States and elsewhere of the revolution which had brought into power a
                    military regime in Pakistan, but at that time no other form of government could
                    have provided the stability and progress which were evident under Ayub. I had
                    tremendous regard for his ability as a leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we influence him in his early pledge to return to
                        democracy, or was all that from his own initiative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: We had some influence in that direction. It was our hope that Pakistan
                    would, as soon as possible, return to democratic processes. Ayub no doubt felt
                    pressures from his own people to do that. He instituted what he called basic
                    democracies which, step-by-step, brought Pakistan more into democratic
                    processes, but far short of real democratic choices which were the ultimate
                    goal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The US was playing an influential role in Pakistan at that
                        time, how was that done primarily? Was it through you in Karachi, or was it
                        done primarily in Washington, or were there other channels that worked to
                        exert US influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: There were multiple channels. Our general policies in Pakistan were
                    articulated locally by myself as ambassador. During the period of my assignment
                    to Pakistan, several important events occurred. One was the visit of President
                    Eisenhower, which was enormously successful. It brought about a closer
                    understanding between Pakistani and American leadership than had ever existed
                    before. Eisenhower and Ayub got along extremely well. They talked with great
                    frankness and candor and established a new relationship which was much to our
                    advantage. Later, during the early days of the Kennedy Administration, Lyndon
                    Johnson, who was then Vice President, came out on a visit. Again, relations
                    between President Ayub and Vice President Johnson were excellent from the
                    outset. The two got along extremely well, with the result that it was easier for
                    Washington and Karachi to communicate. Pakistan felt for the first time that the
                    Kennedy Administration was not unduly prejudicial toward India in matters
                    affecting the interests of the two neighboring countries. President Ayub, at the
                    invitation of President Kennedy, visited Washington for very frank and helpful
                    talks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Vice President Johnson on
                        this? I'm sure you also had reason to see him on other occasions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: My impression was very good. I thought he was extraordinarily able in
                    foreign affairs. I was delighted with his visit with Ayub Khan and the
                    contributions he made as Vice President to a better understanding between the
                    United States and Pakistan. You may recall that during the Vice President's
                    visit to Pakistan in greeting people on the street, he met a camel driver, a
                    fellow by the name of Bashir. And as he shook hands with Bashir he said, in
                    effect, “If you're ever in Texas, look me up”. Reporters picked this up and
                    suggested that the Vice President might want to invite Bashir to come to the
                    United States, which he did. I communicated that invitation to Bashir who, as
                    you might imagine, accepted with great pleasure. He came to the United States
                    and was in the company of the Vice President for a number of days in New York,
                    Texas, Washington and elsewhere. It turned out to be a very successful visit,
                    partly because Bashir, although totally uneducated, made some rather remarkable
                    statements which proved to be invaluable from a public relations standpoint. For
                    example, when I extended the invitation to him in Karachi in the presence of
                    members of the press and made comments to the effect that I was happy to make
                    the presentation, I expected no profound response from Bashir. He surprised me
                    and his audience by saying that he accepted with great appreciation the tickets
                    which I had presented to him and he hoped that I would express his appreciation
                    to his friend Johnson Sahib. He looked forward to going to the United States to
                    visit his friend Johnson Sahib. Perhaps he would be introduced to Kennedy Sahib
                    and that would give him great pleasure, as well. But most of all he looked
                    forward to meeting the American people because he regarded the American people
                    as being leaders of the free world. I was ready to commend my Public Affairs
                    Officer for eliciting such a statement, but he assured me that these were
                    Bashir's own words and that he had nothing to do with the comment. This proved
                    to be true over and over again during Bashir's visit to the United States.
                    Wherever he went with the Vice President, he made extraordinary comments and
                    served as an excellent representative of Pakistan. His quotes were reported all
                    over the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that. Did the Embassy have any trouble tracking
                        him down after this thing snowballed into a state visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: No, no trouble at all. Ayub Khan was a little concerned about Bashir's
                    coming when I talked with him about it before extending the invitation. He
                    expressed his preference that the invitation not be extended because he planned
                    himself to come to the United States soon at the invitation of President
                    Kennedy. He thought Bashir's visit might be treated something like a circus.
                    However, Lyndon Johnson had authorized me to assure Ayub that the visit would be
                    treated in a very dignified fashion. On the basis of this assurance, Ayub agreed
                    that Bashir might come. As it turned out, it was very good in terms of public
                    relations, particularly from the point of view of Pakistan, and it contributed
                    to a nice background for Ayub's own visit: From the camel driver to the
                    President; from the common man to the leader.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the U2 incident in May 1960 and the impact that
                        it had in Pakistan, wrecking the Paris summit? I think it had been secret up
                        until then that these U2 aircraft had been even flying out of Pakistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: These flights had taken place for some time under extremely special and
                    secret arrangements with Ayub Khan. In each case before such a flight took
                    place, I had to get his specific approval. And the Gary Powers flight did, in
                    fact, take place from Pakistan. I was asked in mid-April to get permission for
                    this flight and I flew from Karachi to Rawalpindi to talk with the President
                    about it. I communicated his concurrence to Washington. The flight was delayed
                    for several days because of weather and other problems, and actually took place
                    toward the end of April.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember Khrushchev kept it quiet for some time that the
                        Soviets had captured Powers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Before the flight actually took place, Ayub was slated to go for a
                    Commonwealth meeting in London. At the same time, I returned to Washington on
                    consultation. I left Washington, I believe it was the last day of April. When I
                    arrived at the airport in London, I was told that the CIA Station Chief wanted
                    urgently to see me. It was early in the morning, as I recall about 7 o'clock,
                    and I went straight to the Embassy to see him. He told me that the U2 plane was
                    down, there had been nothing said about it by the Russians, and they had no word
                    of the fate of the pilot, Gary Powers. I was fully briefed on the situation as
                    it was known, and then went to Ayub's hotel where I filled him in over
                    breakfast. He took the news very calmly, but expressed the strong hope that we
                    would adhere to the cover story that had been agreed in advance. He asked me to
                    inform President Eisenhower of that, which I did by an immediate telegram to
                    Washington. Both Ayub and I returned to Pakistan, and a good many days went by
                    before there was any announcement by the Soviets. Of course, when it did come it
                    came in a spectacular fashion. Ayub did not seem unduly concerned about this,
                    but Pakistan was subjected to a tremendous amount of Soviet propaganda and
                    threats. You might recall, in particular, the threat of bombing Peshawar, from
                    where the U2 took off. I would say that the decision on the part of President
                    Eisenhower eventually to admit exactly what had happened and to make it a matter
                    of public record, however necessary this might have been, surprised Ayub and
                    rendered it difficult for him to deal with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eisenhower didn't do that until they produced Gary Powers
                        did he? First we denied it, which was the cover story.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: That's right, and then he felt compelled to make it all public. This
                    made Ayub's problem with the Soviets rather difficult. A number of things
                    happened after that which tended to soften Pakistan's relations with the Soviet
                    Union. Ayub acceded to a suggestion by one of his young cabinet officers,
                    Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Minister of Fuel and Power, that he accept a Soviet request
                    to send an oil mission to Pakistan. This had been offered by the Soviets some
                    time before. And so they permitted the Soviet mission to come as one means of
                    relieving pressures between Pakistan and the Soviets. Not long after that, the
                    same minister was instrumental in bringing about a change in Pakistan's China
                    policy. Ayub recognized Red China and expelled the Nationalist Chinese
                    Ambassador and Embassy. So there began at the time of the U2 incident a gradual
                    change in Pakistani policies, which altered the nature of Pakistan's relations
                    with the United States, although the basic friendship and cooperation with the
                    United States remained.</p>
                <p>I left Pakistan in 1962 and went as Ambassador to the Sudan. After I departed,
                    Ayub's position became less firm. He made more and more concessions toward
                    democratic processes under a system which he called “basic democracy”. When he
                    eventually lost power, the young minister I mentioned, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, had
                    a meteoric rise in influence and became a candidate for election to President,
                    and eventually won that post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you gotten to know Bhutto when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I knew Bhutto quite well. When I was in Pakistan Bhutto was a very
                    suave, sophisticated man with a beautiful wife, a very wealthy man of
                    considerable property—many hundreds of thousands of acres of land. He enjoyed
                    western-type entertainment, parties and so forth. Shortly after we arrived, he
                    invited my wife and me to his estate up near Moenjodaro, a place called Larkana.
                    We spent a weekend there with a number of Pakistani leaders and I came to know
                    him quite well, even at the outset of our tour. We continued to see a lot of him
                    socially, as well as officially. When he decided to enter politics he gave up
                    his western dress and lifestyle and became a more traditional Pakistani leader.
                    When we were in Pakistan his daughter was a young child, perhaps eight or nine
                    years old. As you know, now she is the head of state in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the move of the capital to Rawalpindi and Islamabad
                        take place during your tenure?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: It did indeed. That's an interesting story in itself. Shortly after we
                    arrived in Karachi, the new, beautiful chancery building was completed, and my
                    wife and I gave a party to celebrate its opening. We had, perhaps, 2,000 guests,
                    with bands and other entertainment. I made a speech and described the new
                    chancery as indicative of the close relations which existed between the United
                    States and Pakistan, as symbolic of this special association. I then introduced
                    President Ayub who, during the course of his remarks, announced that the capital
                    was being moved from Karachi to Rawalpindi, pending the construction of a new
                    capital city at Islamabad. All this to take effect immediately. This came as a
                    great surprise to Pakistanis and Americans alike. We thus learned that one of
                    the most beautiful embassy chanceries would soon become a consulate general.
                    From that time, Ayub spent most of his time in Rawalpindi. When I had
                    consultations or discussions with him, I would ordinarily have to fly to
                    Rawalpindi. He did from time-to-time come to Karachi where we would always meet,
                    but that was the exception, not the rule.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did he do that? After all, Karachi was by far the
                        largest city and Rawalpindi way up in the boondocks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: He wanted to move away from the sea, and wanted, in particular, to get
                    it into an area which was more home to him. He never liked Karachi, and few
                    Pathans did. His great ambition was to build a new capital city as a monument to
                    himself. So he decided to take the bull by the horns and announce the move, and
                    chose the occasion of our Embassy dedication to do so. We had the good fortune
                    of having one house in Rawalpindi which had been used by our AID personnel as a
                    guest quarters for their rather frequent visits to that part of the country.
                    This was an advantage not shared by any other diplomatic mission. There were
                    inadequate facilities in Rawalpindi for diplomatic missions to rent or otherwise
                    acquire new residences. The President did make it possible for diplomats to rent
                    facilities at a town called Murree, 39 miles from Rawalpindi in the foothills of
                    the Himalayas, up winding mountain roads from Rawalpindi. We rented one building
                    for a Political Officer who I assigned there full-time to be in close proximity
                    to Rawalpindi, and rented a house for myself to be used during the period in
                    which Ayub Khan was in residence in Murree, which generally was in June and
                    July. I saw Ayub frequently during this period, but otherwise my meetings with
                    him would normally require flights from Karachi to Rawalpindi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period too, the Pakistan-Afghan differences
                        became quite serious. There was a severance of diplomatic relations in
                        September 1961, a cessation of transit of goods to Afghanistan through
                        Pakistan, which was their main route and, for some reason I can't figure
                        out, our Ambassador to Canada, Livingston Merchant, came out on a “good
                        offices” mission to try to help resolve the Afghan-Pakistan differences. How
                        did that come about, and how did he do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: This was a very difficult period and one that caused us a great deal of
                    concern. There was, in fact, open warfare at times between Pakistan and
                    Afghanistan. The implications of this, in terms of stability in the entire
                    region, were disturbing. We made an all out effort to assist in resolving the
                    problem, and urged both sides to settle this matter peacefully. We were finally
                    instrumental in bringing an end to hostilities and in reopening the border.
                    Livingston Merchant, who had been our Ambassador in Canada, and at one time was
                    Under Secretary of State, was asked to come out to visit both sides and extend
                    good offices in providing suggestions which might facilitate a settlement. Livy
                    was a good friend of mine whose diplomatic talents I highly respected, and we
                    welcomed his visit. Although he was not immediately successful, he certainly
                    contributed to the final good result.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in November 1962 Averell Harriman comes out, shows up
                        again in your presence with Duncan Sandys. That was on the Pakistani-Indian
                        differences, I guess, particularly over Kashmir wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I had left by then. Averell Harriman came out while I was there,
                    shortly after the Kennedy Administration came into office. His concern at that
                    time was primarily Indochina, not matters related directly to Kashmir or other
                    Pakistan matters. His being in the area did give the new Administration an
                    additional opportunity to have talks with Nehru in India, and with Ayub Khan in
                    Pakistan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move on to the Sudan in about July 1962. The United
                        States was, at that time and had been for a number of years, putting a lot
                        of money into the aid program there, pro-western, largest country in Africa
                        and all, what was the strategy behind the aid program? The overall strategy
                        for developing a backward country like the Sudan? Was there one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: The main strategy was simply to build upon those aspects of the economy
                    giving the best prospects of success, which meant really concentrating largely
                    on agriculture and agricultural industries, and things that support them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And infrastructure, dams, roads.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Exactly. Sudan was a country with virtually no roads. Vehicular
                    transport was across the desert. The vast majority of all goods movement was by
                    water. We did endeavor to begin some kind of road system, and in fact built a
                    road from Wad Medani to Khartoum, though not without extraordinary difficulty.
                    It was built, and it established a pattern. Since then there has been some
                    additional roads, but it remains largely a country with a grossly inadequate
                    infrastructure in transport, except river transport. This has always been a
                    factor in the isolation of the southern regions of the country, populated mainly
                    by blacks.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: The United States endeavored to play a role, with limited success, nor
                    has it been very successful even today. There has always been very deep-rooted
                    hatred and fear between the blacks of the southern part of the Sudan and the
                    Arabs of the north. The Arabs have always dominated. And following the
                    independence of the Sudan from the British and the Egyptians, the country was
                    ruled by the Arab, Moslem portion of the population.</p>

                        difficult in an area of civil war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: There were limited means by which we could exercise influence. In the
                    first place, there was no official representation whatsoever in the southern
                    part of the country. The only Americans in the south were a few missionaries,
                    and shortly after I arrived in the country the Sudanese government expelled all
                    missionaries. This meant the closure of all schools, churches, hospitals,
                    clinics, medical facilities, etc., because only foreign missionaries provided
                    those facilities for the people of the south.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any differences of opinion between you and
                        Washington over what the United States should do, or could do in the
                        Sudan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I don't recall any substantial differences of opinion, although we did
                    have a continuous, active exchange of views. We both felt that apart from
                    talking with representatives of the government, urging them along specific
                    lines, there was very little that we could do in the circumstances, which at
                    that time were extraordinary. You may recall that this problem was enormously
                    complicated while I was there, and incidentally while you were there, by the
                    fact that the initial government of the Sudan had been replaced in a military
                    coup. From the outset of my assignment, Sudan was run by the army, under the
                    leadership of General Abboud. It was a relatively benign military dictatorship
                    but, nevertheless, one that was resented by people who had been engaged in
                    political activity, and particularly by students. The government mishandled
                    several student protests in the course of which students were injured and a few
                    killed. Demonstrations began, first strictly among the students, later with
                    professors, and members of the court, clergy, and leaders from various political
                    elements. Severe measures were taken by the army against these peaceful
                    demonstrations, resulting in a number of people being killed. Incidentally,
                    these events took place in front of the American Embassy which is in the middle
                    of Khartoum, across the street from the Presidency and next to the Central
                    Square. The demonstrations and the measures taken by the government could be
                    seen from the Embassy premises. So we witnessed a revolution, from beginning to
                    end, over a period of several days. We saw student demonstrations met by very
                    strong use of force. We saw the students being joined by faculty and by members
                    of the judiciary, the clergy, businessmen, and then witnesses additional
                    military action by the government. Finally we saw an all-out assault against the
                    demonstrators in which dozens of young people were killed or injured. All of
                    this we saw from the windows of the American Embassy. The government was unable
                    to continue this kind of repression for the simple reason that soldiers and
                    police refused to fire. The position of the government collapsed and the
                    students and other demonstrators won. Initially, a National Front was organized
                    to assume power. This national front was dominated by communists, however, and
                    eventually the traditional political parties in the Sudan forced the communists
                    out and established a new government based more on the traditional political
                    structure. This was a fascinating process for me, as I was in contact with the
                    political leadership throughout and was able to provide continuing input into
                    these delicate relations. The transition was very difficult, but in the process
                    of reorganizing the government, efforts were made to bring southerners into
                    positions of responsibility and into the cabinet. This was a highly commendable
                    step. It could have made a substantial contribution to the settlement of one of
                    the biggest problems in Africa, that of relations between the blacks of southern
                    Sudan and the Moslems of the north. Unfortunately, it did not succeed. There
                    were race riots in Khartoum, resulting from baseless rumors that a leading black
                    Sudanese had been killed by the government. Excited blacks in Khartoum created
                    physical disturbances with a very bloody aftermath in which hundreds of blacks
                    were killed. The basic problems have continued, and still present one of the
                    most formidable dilemmas in Africa.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your tour in the Sudan, too, President Kennedy was
                        assassinated. And in the Sudan, as well as in many other Third World
                        countries, there was a tremendous outpouring of grief and sympathy over that
                        assassination. How do you explain that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: It came as a surprise to me that so many Sudanese all over the country
                    felt a sense of personal loss in the death of President Kennedy. It became
                    evident, not only in the Sudan but throughout the world, that the impact of John
                    Kennedy had been much greater than Americans had imagined. In the Sudan I was
                    attending a basketball game, an American team playing a Sudanese team, sitting
                    next to President Abboud. One of my embassy officers leaned over my shoulder and
                    told me that my secretary was on the phone saying that the President had been
                    assassinated. I said that couldn't be true, the President was there. He said,
                    “No, she means the President of the United States”. I left immediately for the
                    Embassy and turned on the radio to find that the Voice of American already had
                    taken over facilities of BBC, and was broadcasting from the hospital in Dallas.
                    Even as I listened to those early reports before President Kennedy's death was
                    actually confirmed, Sudanese—this was late at night—came to the Chancery door to
                    express condolences. Many of them were weeping. Within hours, every taxi in
                    Khartoum had a black banner on its radio aerial. It was evident that people were
                    not merely giving lip service, but felt his death very deeply and
                    emotionally.</p>
                <p>Later, members of the Economic Mission and others Americans who were in remote
                    parts of Sudan told me that wherever they were, they were visited by Sudanese
                    from all walks of life, many of them literally weeping when expressing their
                    admiration of President Kennedy. We had generally known that Kennedy and his
                    philosophies were appreciated worldwide, but I had no idea that the admiration
                    was so extensive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your own personal impressions of President
                        Kennedy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I admired him. I saw very little of him personally. I was in Pakistan
                    when he took office. Happily, from my point of view, I was among the first of
                    Ambassadors appointed by the Eisenhower Administration to be asked to remain in
                    office. I returned to Washington on consultation and had the opportunity of
                    talking with him at length about Pakistan and my mission. Later, when Ayub Khan
                    made a state visit to the United States as a guest of President Kennedy, I was
                    present to brief Kennedy and to attend various sessions between the two leaders.
                    Incidentally, it was on this occasion that the highly publicized and enormously
                    successful state dinner given at Mount Vernon took place. This was the first and
                    only time that Mount Vernon was used for such a purpose. Of course I met with
                    President Kennedy before I left for Khartoum after my appointment to the Sudan,
                    but I never saw him again. This was unlike my relations with the other
                    Presidents under whom I served as Ambassador. I had more frequent opportunities
                    to see them and to know them. Though from what I saw and heard, I was very
                    favorably impressed with President Kennedy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your view about not so much the missionaries in
                        the Sudan who were expelled, but generally your personal and the Foreign
                        Service view of missionaries generally in Africa and Third World
                        countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: My admiration of missionaries serving in remote and dangerous parts of
                    the world has always been very great. When the government of Sudan decided to
                    expel all foreign missionaries, including a good number of Americans, my wife
                    and I made a great point of receiving these people in Khartoum and entertaining
                    them and assisting them in any way that we could. I learned more about the real
                    sacrifices of missionaries in Africa than I had ever known before. There was one
                    woman, for example, who had gone to a remote part of Sudan as a young woman and
                    had stayed there for 50 years. Her nearest non-Sudanese neighbor was 50 miles
                    away and her function for all those years had been to run a leper camp. She was
                    the only missionary there. When she was picked up and put on a truck and brought
                    to Khartoum for expulsion, the several hundred lepers were totally without care.
                    I've often wondered what happened to them. Then there was a couple. The wife was
                    a surgeon, the husband assisted her and performed various other functions. The
                    day they were picked up and put on a truck and brought into Khartoum, they had
                    three recently operated on patients, with no one to care for them. The children
                    of these people were truly impressive young human beings. The sacrifices that
                    their parents had made and the extremely limited contacts which they had had
                    with the outside world had given them an aspect of life, of humanity, that I
                    found extraordinarily touching. From the point of view of the contributions that
                    these people made and their personal sacrifices, I simply can't say enough. On
                    the other hand, I believe that very often missionaries operating in such
                    circumstances have been able to achieve so little that their service might be
                    questionable.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before moving to South Africa and how that came about, I
                        want to ask, too, how the appointment to the Sudan came about from Pakistan?
                        After all, Sudan was an important African country, but after having been
                        Assistant Secretary and then Ambassador to an important country like
                        Pakistan, it was not exactly a promotion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Not a promotion. I didn't look upon it at the time as a promotion. When
                    I was completing my tour in Pakistan I had, in fact, expected to go to
                    Australia. I was told by officials in Washington that it was the intention of
                    the President to send me to Australia. That was changed and how the Sudan came
                    to be substituted, I've never really known. In any event, it was a challenge and
                    I was happy to accept the appointment. I found it one of my more interesting
                    experiences.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was under the Kennedy Administration. Now the
                        appointment to South Africa is under Lyndon Johnson. How did that one come
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I don't exactly know how the decision was made, but I did know
                    President Johnson had in mind appointing me to some suitable post. I welcomed
                    the opportunity of going to South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your main mission, objective and US goals in
                        South Africa at that time, in 1965?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: The situation in South Africa and US relations with that country at
                    that time were wholly different than at present. South Africa was one of the few
                    independent countries in Africa. We had had a long history of close relations.
                    They were with us in both World Wars and Korea. It was country with which we had
                    done business on highly favorable terms. For example, at that time our favorable
                    balance of trade with South Africa was in the neighborhood of $700-$800 million
                    a year—that is, in our favor. It was a country upon which we relied for many,
                    not only important but absolutely vital, minerals, things which we could not do
                    without in our defense industry and our business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our policy on apartheid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Apartheid had always been repugnant to the United States and our
                    policies were to work toward its end. We expressed our objection in many forms.
                    However, it did not have the enormous opposition of the American public that it
                    later received. I wouldn't say that it was not a factor in domestic attitudes
                    and politics, but the public attention it received was small compared with that
                    which attached to apartheid in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Nevertheless, it
                    has always been our policy to oppose apartheid and to use whatever influence we
                    could to bring about a change in South Africa's race relations. After the 1960s,
                    the willingness of the United States to take progressively stronger measures
                    grew. We joined, for example, with other countries in imposing restrictions
                    against the provision of police equipment, arms, ammunition, anything of that
                    sort, and took initiatives at the United Nations and the International
                    Court.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your period there, did you have contact with
                        prominent black leaders? Mandela was already in jail wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Mandela was already in jail.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You knew about Mandela and he was famous?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Oh yes, he was famous. Our attitude toward apartheid was manifested in
                    many ways, including deliberate efforts on the part of my embassy to meet and
                    exchange views with blacks and members of other racial groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you have mixed racial parties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Yes, of course. This was a real bone of contention in our relations
                    with the South African government. The Fourth of July party, for example, would
                    include a large number of blacks, coloreds, Indians, as well as white South
                    Africans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Afrikaner officials came?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Some Afrikaner officials came, some did not. As time went on, more and
                    more attended, and eventually there was no problem in inviting them and having
                    them attend. Incidentally, particularly at smaller parties where you got various
                    races together, they seemed to enjoy exchanging views and discussing matters
                    among themselves. It has been perfectly evident to me since I've had anything to
                    do with South Africa, that the most constructive influence against apartheid,
                    against repressive race relations, has been exercised by American firms doing
                    business in South Africa. I regret that so many people in the United States,
                    including members of Congress, have insisted that Americans disinvest in South
                    Africa and that American firms operating in South Africa leave. Until recently,
                    most of the really constructive things that were done, such as doing away with
                    job reservations and achieving equal pay for equal work, were brought about more
                    because of the influence of American businesses than any other factor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The argument was that it was too gradual, too slow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: That was the argument and perhaps there is some merit in that, but
                    during the period in which I was serving in South Africa and had responsibility
                    for relations between South Africa and the United States, I felt that this was
                    one of the constructive things that was going on. This was one of the few means
                    by which we were making any impact, and I regret that this was dropped, rather
                    than being supplemented by other measures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have contact, I assume you did, with Robert

                        the other side, things had to change quicker?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Yes, he and his wife came out while I was there. They stayed with us in
                    Pretoria, and we entertained them not only in that city but elsewhere. We
                    arranged meetings for the Senator with white South Africans, as well as blacks
                    and others, but the South African government refused to meet with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Because they objected to the purposes of his visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was invited by a students' organization, a liberal one,
                        and black.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Black and white. He made a series of speeches, and met with people
                    across the political spectrum, including some Afrikaners, but not members of the
                    government. He said from the outset that he was not coming to provide solutions
                    to the problem, he was coming to learn. He made clear his abhorrence of
                    apartheid, of this kind of repressive race relations, and gained a lot of
                    friends and admirers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's quoted as saying during his visit he met Chief
                        Luthuli. Robert Kennedy, I believe, called him “one of the most impressive
                        men I've met anywhere in the world”. Did you know Luthuli?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Yes. A very impressive man indeed. Another impressive man is Chief
                    Buthelezi, who succeeded Luthuli as head of the Zulu tribe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know Prime Minister Verwoerd before he was
                        assassinated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Yes. Verwoerd was the Prime Minister when I arrived and I saw quite a
                    bit of him in my early days in South Africa. South Africa has several capitals.
                    The administrative capital is Pretoria, the legislative capital is Cape Town,
                    and the judicial capital in Bloemfontein. We had recently moved from Pretoria to
                    Cape Town for the parliamentary session. I attended parliamentary sessions as a
                    visitor only infrequently but an Embassy Officer was often assigned to sit in
                    the gallery to observe the proceedings. On this particular occasion a young
                    Political Officer was there. Before the session began—Verwoerd was on the floor,
                    with other ministers and members still coming in. The American Officer noticed a
                    uniformed messenger walk in the door to the assembly room. For some reason the
                    messenger attracted the officer's attention. He was then recognized as a man of
                    Greek origin who had been in the embassy several times to find out how to sue
                    the United States Government. The officer's eyes followed the messenger as he
                    walked across the floor, drew a knife and stabbed Verwoerd. The officer rushed
                    back to the embassy and reported this to me, and we sent a flash message to
                    Washington, reporting the name of the man and the fact that he had been expelled
                    by the United States on at least one and, perhaps two occasions. We knew that
                    while he was in the United States he had been in mental institutions. We asked
                    urgently for background data.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Yes, illegally. We had expelled him. And he wanted to sue the United
                    States because we had deported him to South Africa instead of to Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know he was a schizophrenic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: As so, within minutes intelligence, background from Washington started
                    pouring in, giving full details. I don't know how they had such immediate access
                    to all this information. This, of course, I took immediately to the Foreign
                    Minister. It's an interesting little sidelight to the fact that, yes, I did know
                    Verwoerd who was in office during my early days in South Africa but died soon
                    after.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that embassy officer, just out of curiosity? Do
                        you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: He was a young lawyer who had passed the bar exams and then had applied
                    for the Foreign Service. This was his first assignment, and he was detailed to
                    the Political Section. He was awfully good in ferreting out information and
                    making contacts across the political spectrum. This was the only assignment he
                    had, as he resigned soon thereafter. Verwoerd was replaced as Prime Minister by
                    John Vorster, who remained in that office for the remainder of my stay in South
                    Africa.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vorster had a reputation, I believe, as a ruthless
                        Minister of Justice before he became Prime Minister.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: He had the reputation of being a very strict man and disciplinarian. He
                    was an extremely strong proponent of apartheid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was also a golfer. Did you play golf with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Yes, he was a golfer. No I didn't. I played very little golf in South
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand they have some beautiful courses.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Yes, they do. Suzanne played regularly. I played twice, I think, the
                    whole time I was there. Incidentally, we never even met Gary Player until our
                    retirement in Florida.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In February 1967, the US aircraft carrier FDR was visiting
                        Cape Town. The US Government refused shore leave because of segregated
                        hospitality and apparently the South African government reacted very
                        angrily. Could you say something about your role in all that, the
                        implications of that ship visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Yes, it was an interesting event and in most respects a very sad event
                    for me. I was back in Washington on consultation and I was asked to meet with
                    the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which I did. The purpose of the meeting was for them
                    to impress on me the importance of ship visits to South Africa. At that
                    particular stage in history, it would have been enormously beneficial to have
                    access to South African ports.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>The Secretary of the Navy at that time was Paul Nitze. While I was in Washington
                    we worked out an arrangement which seemed satisfactory to all concerned,
                    including to officials of Defense, Navy and State. Even before I returned to
                    South Africa I was in communication by telegram with my staff setting forth the
                    circumstances in which the visit could take place. I put in motion conversations
                    with South African officials to work out the details. I returned to South Africa
                    and all aspects of this proposed visit were completed in close telegraphic
                    consultation with Washington, which knew exactly what we were going to do, when,
                    where, and for what reason. This was all approved. The FDR was to arrive on a
                    certain day. Twenty four hours before arrival time a large group of congressmen
                    visited the Secretary of the Navy and, as I recall, other officials to protest
                    the visit of the FDR. They exacted from the Administration, despite the fact
                    that all the details had been worked out and previously agreed, conditions that
                    rendered it impossible to go forward with the visit. I asked for and received a
                    visit by helicopter from the Executive Officer of the FDR. We spent the night
                    going over various alternatives and exchanging telegrams with Washington. But
                    finally the word was, indeed, that there would be no leave except for organized,
                    integrated activities. Now the arrangements included many organized, integrated
                    activities which went far beyond the strict apartheid laws of South Africa, but
                    there was such a tremendous variety of activities to render it impossible to say
                    that each and every one was organized and integrated. For example, several
                    hundred volunteers with automobiles were to pick up members of the crew to take
                    them on visits, excursions, home dinners and so forth. Several hotels had
                    canceled their business in order to give dinners and luncheons for members of
                    the crew. There were all kinds of activities, but there was no way that the
                    leave could be granted under the conditions imposed by Washington. Therefore,
                    the result was that all leave was canceled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They insisted that everything be integrated?</hi>

                <p>ROUNTREE: Everything be integrated. Nothing except organized, integrated
                    activities. And there was no way in a matter of a few hours of changing all the
                    tremendous plans that had been made and previously agreed by Washington. Every
                    aspect of it had been agreed. So the next morning the ship came in and the
                    Minister of Defense and the Minister of the Navy, according to the program,
                    called on the Captain. It was then we announced that there would be no leave.
                    The next three days the ship sat at the dock, the crew had put big signs over
                    the side “CAPE TOWN WE LOVE YOU”. 25,000-30,000 South Africans of all races went
                    aboard to visit it. It was truly an integrated activity there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the original plans had explicitly any segregated

                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: No, not explicitly. But it was the sort of thing in which I think
                    everybody lost. The South Africans of all races and political persuasion were
                    really unhappy. The enormous trouble to which hundreds of volunteers had gone
                    was a dead loss. It had all been worked out on such an open, frank basis—and
                    then to have it all collapse was sad, but the saddest aspect to me was that the
                    arrangement under which American vessels could again visit South African ports,
                    collapsed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever find out exactly what happened in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Oh, yes. The decision was made at a high level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been the President.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: The people who had issued the final orders, that is nothing but
                    organized, integrated activities, did not realize the implication of that—that
                    it really meant no leave. Now it's also interesting, too, that after this visit,
                    within a matter of days, there was an American naval vessel passing southwest
                    Africa. One of the crew, in this case a black sailor, had acute appendicitis and
                    peritonitis, I got an emergency call and arranged for this ship to come into
                    Cape Town to deliver the patient. He was put in a hospital and given top flight
                    medical care. And then, within a few days, another vessel coming in from the
                    other side around Durban, had a medical emergency. One of the engineers had
                    metal thrown in his eye while drilling. I had to arrange for this vessel to come
                    in to Durban and deliver this fellow for medical treatment. All this within a
                    matter of days after the FDR incident, before the deep resentment had subsided.
                    So what I'm really saying is that those of us most distressed over the results
                    of the FDR fiasco—and it was a fiasco on our part—fully sympathized with the
                    objectives of the decision. Sometimes in efforts to achieve objectives gross
                    mistakes are made. This, in my judgment, was one of them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: It probably did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did no further ship visits take place then during your

                <p>ROUNTREE: No, and they've never been resumed. Now it may very well be, and
                    probably is true, that the importance of having that facility available was much
                    greater at that time because of our naval activity in the Pacific and Indian
                    Ocean than it is now or ever will be again. But at that time it was worth going
                    to an awful lot of trouble to achieve.</p>

                <p>ROUNTREE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any blacks on your staff, any black officials

                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Not during my time or before. The main reason for that was the
                    difficulty in living arrangements for non-whites and the existence of South
                    African laws which made such assignments highly impractical. But after my tour
                    of duty, we were able to assign non-whites in an atmosphere rendering their
                    service there more feasible. Incidentally, the assignment of diplomatic
                    representatives from black African nations was a strong factor while I was in
                    South African in causing the Government to alter its position with respect to
                    non-white emissaries. The last time I was in South Africa we had a top-flight
                    black Consul General in Cape Town and, more recently, we've had a black
                    Ambassador to South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During 1969 there was, I believe, a very important
                        US-South African agreement on floor price for gold. Did you play a role in
                        that? It was considered at the time a big victory for the United States and
                        the International Monetary Fund. I think it was just before Nixon went off
                        the gold in 1970.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Very much so. It was one of the matters under constant discussion and
                    review during my tour of duty there. Generally, we urged the South Africans to
                    adhere to General Assembly and International Court decisions, but unfortunately
                    the court decisions were not all that favorable from the viewpoints which we
                    espoused.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We really didn't have a lot of means to influence the
                        South African government, did we? We needed them in those years as much or
                        more than they needed us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: We exercised some influence during that entire period, and considerable
                    influence at times. The South Africans of all races were far more concerned with
                    American attitudes than any other. As I said, one of the most constructive
                    aspects of American influence has been American firms doing business in South
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was South Africa, to your knowledge, engaged in a nuclear

                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Not nuclear arms, but nuclear power.</p>
                <p>Another aspect of our relations with South Africa, far more important then than
                    now, was our space program, which simply could not have operated as it did
                    without South African tracking stations. Their cooperation and the technical
                    excellence of their participation were very real factors when I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they take any actions to try to hurt us when we got
                        into conflict over Southwest Africa or others things, or threaten to close
                        the tracking stations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: No. They were always meticulous in this and there was never any threat,
                    while I was there, of if you do this we will do that. Of course, quite
                    naturally, they pointed out the mutual benefits of one policy as opposed to
                    another, but never made threats. Nor am I aware of threats made by the South
                    African government following the imposition of the drastic sanctions in more
                    recent years which rendered it illegal to import almost anything from South
                    Africa or to export almost anything to South Africa. We closed down South
                    African use of civil air facilities, banned imports of the Krugerrand, and so
                    forth. It has never, to my knowledge, been the position of the South African
                    government that if you do these things to us, we will not permit you to import
                    our chrome, platinum, manganese, or other strategic materials without which you
                    can't run your industries. Alternative sources are only the Soviet Union and
                    communist countries. That has surprised me, and pleased me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a change in the domestic interest in South
                        Africa that was reflected in the Congress and the Nixon Administration when
                        they came in as a result of what was happening in the United States, for one
                        thing, during the 1960s, but during that five years you were in South
                        Africa, by the end of your tour, was there a much higher sensitivity to
                        events in South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Oh, I think so. American domestic interests in South Africa increased
                    every year during the 1960s and 1970s. You see my first responsibility for
                    relations with South Africa began in 1955 when I was Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    of State for the Near East, South Asia and Africa, and then from 1956 when I was
                    Assistant Secretary of State for that region. In these early years, public
                    interest of the United States in South Africa and the racial policies of South
                    Africa was relatively small. But since then, and particularly after the 1960s,
                    when so much was happening in this country with respect to our own racial
                    problems, the concern of the American public and consequently, the American
                    Congress has increased dramatically and constantly. The answer to your question
                    really is, when I went to South Africa in 1965 it was still during the process
                    of racial awakening in the United States and demonstrations were leading to
                    fundamental changes here. Naturally, during the course of my five years in South
                    Africa interest in racial matters outside the United States increased.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Afrikaners, Afrikaner officials in
                        particular, during this period? Did they know a lot about the United States,
                        about our system, our racial problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: They did, indeed. All of them made a study of it and, of course, drew
                    parallels between our respective histories. Most of the educated Afrikaners
                    became students, of race relations. Not only in South Africa but in the United
                    States and elsewhere, because they wanted to inform themselves for their own
                    purposes. Every aspect of racial developments in the United States was big news
                    to them. They followed with great interest reports of demonstrations and so
                    forth, and noted with equal interest the consequences of these demonstrations,
                    changes in American laws and practices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Aside from matters of race, when they looked to the
                        outside world, when and if they did look to the outside world, did they look
                        more to Europe? Did they visit Europe? Did they have contacts with Europeans
                        more than they did with the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: English-speaking South Africans constitute about 45% of the white
                    population, and look mainly to England. Many still feel close attachment to
                    their place of origin. Afrikaners, who are descendants of Dutch, French and
                    German settlers, no longer look to Europe. They consider themselves to be white
                    Africans. That's one of the main differences between the Afrikaners and other
                    whites in South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't come to the states either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: They would visit Europe, but they did not look upon Europe as the
                    fatherland, the homeland. The most important foreign country in the world to
                    Afrikaners then and now is the United States, even with the existence of
                    economic and other sanctions.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the South African government established black
                        homelands and pursued the policies with regard to the land, they left the
                        blacks with some of the worst land and a very small percentage of the land,
                        given their population. What was the Afrikaner rationale behind being so
                        stingy with the land distribution, do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Possibly the most ludicrous aspect of apartheid was the decision to
                    assign to such a huge percentage of the population such a small percentage of
                    the land area, most of that being extremely poor land. The homelands concept was
                    merely to establish some rationale for the deprivation of civil rights to the
                    blacks occupying territory in what the Afrikaners considered to be white South
                    Africa. I know of no South African, Afrikaner or otherwise, who has provided any
                    logical justification for this concept.</p>

                        continued when the Nixon Administration continued. They must have asked you
                        to stay on in South Africa because you stayed there quite a while after the
                        change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Yes, I returned to Washington at the change of Administration when
                    President Nixon took office. I met with him and we went over our policies in
                    South Africa. I learned from him his views on our relations with that country. I
                    was very pleased that, at that time and subsequently, I found myself in complete
                    agreement with President Nixon and with the general course of American policy in
                    South Africa. I was told in 1970 that he wanted me to go to Brazil as his
                    Ambassador. I was rather surprised at the change from the Near East and South
                    African area to South America, never having served in Latin America before. I
                    was told that it was his desire to have someone have a fresh look at our
                    policies and relations in South America, and he decided that I was the one to do
                    it in Brazil. I welcomed the assignment and enjoyed it tremendously.</p>

                <p>ROUNTREE: I knew him quite well and had a very good impression of him, a fellow

                    as one of the principal advisors to President Nixon. I did not serve under him
                    when he became Secretary of State. I had retired by then. But I had followed his
                    work with great interest.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to Brazil, one of the big issues, I believe,
                        was personal safety and the threat of terrorism. Was it not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Yes, terrorists were very active in Brazil in those days. As a matter
                    of fact, my predecessor as American Ambassador in Brazil had been kidnaped and
                    was injured in the course of his capture. The Brazilians had embarked on a
                    program of anti-terrorism that created some criticism in the United States and
                    elsewhere because of the extreme pressures they put on terrorists once they were
                    captured. One of my tasks in Brazil was to articulate American concern for
                    safety and security in Brazil on the one hand, but on the other hand concern
                    that the means of coping with prisoners should be civilized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any terrorists incidents involving you during
                        your tour in Brazil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: No, not an incident directly involving me, although there were many
                    reports of plans of assassination or capture. I was provided by the government
                    of Brazil with a strong security guard wherever I went, particularly in Rio or
                    Sao Paulo. There usually were police cars preceding and following mine, with
                    armed guards. A policemen with a machine gun rode in my own car. The embassy
                    premises were strongly guarded. There was never an occasion in which my life was
                    put in immediate danger. Other ambassadors, in addition to Ambassador Elbrick,
                    were kidnaped. The German ambassador and the Swiss ambassador, for example. In
                    each of these cases the government of Brazil agreed to free captured terrorists
                    in return for the release of the diplomats. The United States Government never
                    engaged in negotiations with terrorists in the case of Ambassador Elbrick or
                    others. The decision to meet the demands of the captors was one made entirely by
                    the government of Brazil. As I said, Ambassador Elbrick did suffer injury which
                    could have had a highly detrimental effect on his subsequent health.</p>
                <p>At the outset of my service as Ambassador to Brazil, I announced that I would
                    move the embassy from Rio to the new capital of Brasilia. I was the first
                    Ambassador to make the full-time move. This was not an easy task because we had
                    many hundreds of employees in our Rio embassy, and facilities for our diplomatic
                    establishment in Brasilia had not been completed, and in some cases not even
                    begun. It took a year to make the move from one city to the other, during which
                    I was required to spend most of my time in Rio. Over the months I was able to
                    spend progressively more time, with progressively more staff in Brasilia.
                    Eventually we were there full time. It was a fascinating experience to be a part
                    of this historic move from Rio to the new capital and I enjoyed it.</p>

                <p>ROUNTREE: It is interesting that in three of my Ambassadorial posts, Brazil,
                    South Africa and Pakistan, I had to maintain more than one diplomatic residence.
                    There were only four such countries in the world, to my knowledge, and I
                    happened to be Ambassador to three of them. The fourth was Libya, but Libya
                    ended that practice with the revolution that overthrew the King.</p>

                        visited the White House. What brought that about? Was that your idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: I think it was an idea of a good many people, including President
                    Medici, who wanted very much to meet President Nixon, and Nixon himself who
                    attached great importance to our relations with Brazil. Nixon had a particular
                    interest in our relations with Latin American neighbors. Brazil, after all, is
                    half the land area of South America, has about half the population of South
                    America, and possesses more than half of the natural resources of that
                    continent. Thus its importance in the context of US interests and relations can
                    be understood.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: About Latin American governments, I don't at the moment recall, but
                    certainly there had been other military governments, such as those of Pakistan
                    and Sudan, whose heads have been invited to make state visits to Washington.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: It was a very successful visit and gave us an opportunity to review
                    many things that we and the Brazilians have in common. Brazil, over the years,
                    has been one of the best friends of the United States. It has never been our
                    enemy. Brazil has been consistently with us in military operations, including
                    World War I, World War II, the Berlin Airlift, and various situations in Latin
                    America. We have maintained in Brazil, since 1922, a military mission that has
                    been very important to us, and military facilities established during World War
                    II have been continued in one form or another. Our military have cooperated in
                    many respects over the years, and the Brazilian economy has greatly benefitted
                    by American investments in that country. There had never been a time in which
                    anti-Americanism was a factor in relations with Brazil. We extended enormous
                    amounts of financial and economic help to the Brazilians when they needed it to
                    expand their economy, and the progress which they made rendered it possible
                    greatly to reduce aid levels during my terms of office. I think our relations
                    were at an absolute peak in 1972, the time of the visit of President Medici. So
                    it was a good visit in a good situation. The main problem that we were having
                    with Brazil related to their treatment of captured terrorists but even that had
                    by then greatly abated and the situation had begun to return to normal. The
                    process of transition between the military regime and a return to democracy,
                    which we advocated, had only just begun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was also a period of great economic growth for Brazil
                        and by 1972 they had finished the first 1200 kilometers of the
                        Trans-Amazonian Highway. At that time, was there any concern about the
                        destruction of the Brazil Amazon rain forests and the species and all
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: There was a great deal of concern, but the magnitude of this program
                    and its effects on the world ecology was just beginning to be understood.
                    Perhaps the international community should have been far more forceful at the
                    time, although whether this would have made much of a difference is
                    questionable. We were, indeed, concerned with the ecology. We were concerned not
                    only with the effects on the ecology of the Trans-Amazonian Highway, but also
                    the effects of pollution, which was rampant in Brazil at that time. I was
                    instructed on several occasions to take up with Brazilian authorities, including
                    the President, our hope that the Brazilians would join us in anti-pollution
                    efforts we were making through the United Nations. During this period, Brazil
                    was making the greatest economic progress in its history, achieving solid gains
                    across the board, particularly in industrial and agricultural production. And,
                    for the first time, Brazilians were seeing the benefits of turning more to the
                    interior of the country in their development efforts, capitalizing on lands that
                    theretofore had never effectively been utilized. As I indicated, one of the few
                    differences of real importance that we had with Brazil during my term of office
                    concerned the ecology. Whenever these questions were raised with them, they
                    would reply quite frankly that they hoped the time would come when they could
                    undertake anti-pollution measures but, for the immediate future, their main
                    concern would have to be increased production and improving the economic welfare
                    of the Brazilian people. Their response to American approaches at high levels
                    bilaterally and through the United Nations would, therefore, be simply that
                    they'd have to “reserve their right to pollute”. And that is a term they used,
                    quite literally. I think the pollution problem in Brazil has gotten even more
                    out of hand. Since then the devastation wrought by the development of the
                    Amazon, the Trans-Amazon Highway and all the new projects in that region has
                    increased the alarm of the international community. Hopefully, it's increased
                    the concern of the Brazilian government as well. Clearly, what was a matter of
                    concern to us in 1970-1973 when I was there, is a problem of far greater
                    proportions today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Brazil has the reputation of having one of the most
                        inequitable distributions of income in Latin American, or in the world for
                        that matter. Was that true and noticeable in those years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: Yes, it was noticeable then and it continues to be so. There is extreme
                    poverty in all of Brazil, and particularly in the northeast part of the country.
                    It is this situation that initially prompted the government to undertake the
                    Trans-Amazon program. It was their hope that by opening up new areas,
                    substantial relief could be given to disadvantaged Brazilians in the northeast
                    and other parts of the country, and productivity would be increased. I suppose
                    that this has helped but it is my impression that it has been marginal because
                    of the character of the land. The farming projects undertaken do not lend
                    themselves to the kind of small land holder that originally had been
                    anticipated.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: As you know, relatively few Brazilians have reached high levels of
                    education, but among those who have are some of the most capable people I know.
                    Brazilians excel in various facets of the economy, in banking, in industry.
                    Their engineers and architects, for example, are among the best in the world.
                    Brazilians benefitted from the fact that most American investment in Brazil over
                    the years has been in productive, rather than extractive, enterprises.
                    Brazilians learned from American industrial firms how to produce. They were
                    given on-the-job training and were also trained in the United States over the
                    years. Brazilian educational institutions have excelled in many fields. Yes,
                    they are serious and some are highly competent people. Perhaps, the period in
                    which I served in Brazil was the one in which the Brazilians had more sense of
                    cohesion and direction than ever before. Even though a military regime was in
                    control, more constructive progress was being made. They've lost some of that.
                    One cost of a return to democracy has been the loss of the kind of central
                    direction that moved Brazil forward so rapidly. Right now the Brazilian economy
                    is in terrible shape, and it is difficult to see how it can be turned
                    around.</p>

                        posts and if there were any differences among the bureaus?</hi>

                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: In retrospect, I would say that although I had not planned on the
                    Foreign Service as a career—I came into it by accident during the war years—I
                    would not have exchanged it for any other. One reason is that I consider the
                    United States to have the finest Foreign Service in the world, bar none. My
                    experience with career Foreign Service Officers during the war and thereafter,
                    as a subordinate officer in various embassies, in the Department of State and as
                    Ambassador, confirmed that judgment. There are, of course, degrees of
                    excellence. Some Foreign Service Officers naturally are better than others, but
                    there have been relatively few cases during the course of my career in which I
                    have felt that Foreign Service Officers have been inadequate for the positions
                    to which they have been assigned. And I have felt that, on the whole, the
                    selection-out process has worked well to keep the quality of performance very
                    high.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: The things about which I have felt the greatest sense of accomplishment
                    have not necessarily been those for which I have had primary responsibility.
                    That is, some activities in which I have participated, not necessarily those I
                    have directed, are among my fondest memories. For example, my involvement in the
                    Greek-Turkish Aid Program is a source of very great satisfaction to me. I was a
                    part of a vast new undertaking, a new departure in American foreign policy that
                    proved to be highly successful in containing international communism at a
                    critical time. I felt that my personal contribution made a real difference then,
                    as it did later when Greece and Turkey were brought into NATO. I also take a
                    great deal of personal satisfaction in the resolution of the oil controversy in
                    Iran following the ouster of Mossadegh. Not that I played a major role but
                    because I was a significant part of a mechanism that brought about great things.
                    In my initial assignment to the Middle East as a part of the Anglo-American
                    Middle East Supply Center, we were working with the British in war-time
                    operations that were of considerable importance to them and to us. I claim no
                    credit for miracle cures, but I did feel that I was an important part, however
                    small, of a machine that was highly successful in achieving war-time objectives
                    in that area. And so it is with the Foreign Service, generally, which on the
                    whole has done an enormously good job, has served American interests and
                    purposes extremely well. Being a part of that. That has given me great
                    satisfaction, but never more than during the period of several years in which I
                    served as Assistant Secretary of State in charge of one of the most active
                    bureaus in the State Department. During my term of office we dealt with a couple
                    of dozen crises of various degrees of importance and danger, and I had the
                    satisfaction of feeling they generally were well-handled. Certainly President
                    Eisenhower and Secretary Dulles made me feel so. It is good to be able to say
                    after all those years that I was a part of it, that I was glad I was a part of
                    it, and that I feel I made some useful contribution.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything that as a unique experience tops the
                        week or ten days with King Saud in Saudi Arabia, wearing Saudi dress,
                        negotiating that agreement?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: There are many things that parallel it, but I don't know that any have
                    topped it in terms of the impression that it made on me personally and the
                    influence it had on my subsequent career. But I reflect on various missions that
                    I had in the early days; for example, of trying to find out for the Lend/Lease
                    Administration why so many goods were being damaged or destroyed in transit to
                    Russia and to the British forces in the Middle East. I made an urgent survey in
                    the whole Middle East area, seeing how things were handled, who handled them,
                    and what improvements could be made. I formulated telegraphic recommendations to
                    the Lend/Lease Administration in Washington setting forth my views and those of
                    British and American shipping experts in the region as to what would reduce
                    losses of valuable goods and material. These recommendations were translated
                    into new directives by Washington which came into effect with incredible speed.
                    Then, within a matter of a few months, there was a wholly different situation as
                    new goods arrived in the Middle East. Seeing such prompt and constructive
                    results of one's efforts in Government service is an experience to be savored
                    and in retrospect that's one of the happiest aspects of my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the other side of the coin, what was your
                        greatest disappointment in your career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: One of the greatest disappointments was the result of the
                    Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine. We were given an opportunity
                    by President Truman and the British Prime Minister through the efforts of twelve
                    appointed members, six American and six British, with a staff of which I was
                    one, to find a solution to the Palestine question. The problem of the future of
                    Palestine had plagued the British and others directly involved for generations.
                    The Anglo-American Committee represented one of the last chances for a peaceful,
                    fair and rational solution. It is a great pity that it failed. The post-war
                    history of the Middle East could have been wholly different and far more
                    favorable to our interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that because of the committee itself, or because of
                        the political circumstances that already existed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: It was because of many factors, including the political circumstances.
                    It is highly unlikely that the recommendations of the committee would have been
                    or could have been accepted in their entirety, or that a formula could have been
                    found without substantial additional efforts. But to see the attempt fade and
                    fizzle as soon as the report was filed was a disappointment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your post-retirement activities? Was there
                        anything that you'd like to mention? There was one thing you did after
                        Brazil, but you were still on active duty.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>ROUNTREE: No, I was not on active duty. I had retired. I had come to Gainesville,
                    established residence and begun negotiations for the construction of our
                    retirement home. I was asked by Secretary Rogers to undertake a mission to Rome
                    as head of the United States delegation to an international conference on air
                    security, to be paralleled by a conference of the International Civil Aviation
                    Organization to consider additional measures within that organization to cope
                    with the problem of air piracy. I was initially reluctant, but I'm glad that I
                    agreed. I spent a few weeks in Washington to help organize the staff and brief
                    myself on the mission. I then spent a month in Rome for the series of
                    conferences involved. We explored various avenues for improving air security.
                    Perhaps, the mere fact that meetings were held had some positive value, but in
                    the final analysis we were unable to agree on any new conventions or treaties,
                    or amendments to the charter of ICAO. Most of the proposals on which we and the
                    Soviets, and other larger countries could agree, were opposed by some of the
                    Arab or African countries. Thus the effort was not a huge success, and this I
                    particularly regret since that was the only post-retirement project that I
                    undertook for the Government. Locally, my post-retirement activities have been
                    confined to the things I like to do most, including some small participation in
                    activities related to the University of Florida. A few guest lectures, and
                    participation in such organizations as the Friends of Music, Friends of the
                    Library and the Gallery Guild, occasional speeches, Mostly I have traveled, read
                    and played golf.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you say something about both the importance of your
                        family in your career and also the benefits for the family of your
                        career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROUNTREE: My enthusiasm for the Service was always fully shared by my wife and
                    our daughter. We treated assignments in the Foreign Service as family affairs,
                    and enjoyed what we considered to be our respective roles. Any feeling of
                    accomplishment that I have or satisfaction with the career, is shared equally by
                    my wife who carried out important functions at every post we had. There is no
                    doubt in my mind that the success of Foreign Service Officers has often been
                    greatly enhanced or diminished by their families who, wittingly or unwittingly,
                    are diplomatic representatives of our country.</p>
                <p>In my time, most families felt that they benefitted from the service, though
                    there are obvious disadvantages as well. The excitement and interest of life
                    abroad are broadening and rewarding. Not such favorable factors as these are
                    offset to some degree by such considerations as raising children in a foreign
                    atmosphere, the usual experience of making and leaving friends so often, and the
                    inability until after one's career to become a permanent part of a
                    community.</p>
