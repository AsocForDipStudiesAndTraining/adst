                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: December 9, 1994</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with Kingsley W. Hamilton. It is
                        being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies, and I'm
                        Charles Stuart Kennedy. Mr. Hamilton, we want to talk first about your
                        background so our researchers will know where you come from. Could you
                        explain when and where you were born, and a little about your family and
                        early upbringing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: My parents were Presbyterian missionaries in the Philippines, and I was
                    born in Manila, August 1911. So most of my early life was in the Philippines,
                    and we came home on furlough every seven years. Then when I was ready to go to
                    high school, I had an uncle who lived up in China, stationed there. My folks
                    thought health-wise and climatewise, since China had a winter and changing
                    seasons, it might be nice to go up there. So I went in 1925 for my freshman and
                    sophomore years in high school at the North China American School just outside
                    Peking at a place then called Tungchow. I came back to the Philippines, and on
                    to Ohio through Europe to finish high school and go on to the College of
                    Wooster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to go back just a minute to the Philippines. Where
                        in the Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: We were most of the time in Laguna province just south of Manila, and
                    then in Manila itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just a bit about life there for a young boy. Was it pretty
                        much missionary, were you integrated into the Philippine community? How did
                        it work at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Well, we were considerably integrated into the Philippine community
                    when outside Manila where there were very few Americans. In Manila there was a
                    large American community and an American school where I went for the 6th and 7th
                    grades. In Los Banos, there was only one other American family with children, so
                    there I was alone with the Filipino students in the College of Agriculture for
                    two years in its preparatory courses before going up to Tungchow in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In China, did you pick up any Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Not to speak of, just enough to go shopping.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Wooster were you pointed towards a missionary career at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: I wasn't quite sure what I was going to do at first. I did look into
                    the ministry a little bit. One of my best professors was a professor of history,
                    particularly what she called World History, and that attracted me. It covered
                    the origins and development of the first World War and the formation and
                    operation of international organizations after that. This led me to an interest
                    in international affairs. And then the year I graduated, 1933, the Fletcher
                    School of Law and Diplomacy was being started jointly by Tufts and Harvard
                    Universities on the Tufts campus in Medford, Massachusetts. My history professor
                    heard about it, and I put in an application, received a small scholarship, and
                    started with the school that fall. There were only 20 of us that first year. I
                    was at the University of Strasbourg the next year, and back at Fletcher in
                    1935-36.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took the Foreign Service exam when? In '36-'37?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: It was the spring of '36 in Boston.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of exam was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: It was a three-day written affair, as I recall, and of course the orals
                    came later. It covered history, economics, geography, literature, political
                    science, international and commercial law, a foreign language, and general
                    information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you passed it when you took it. Had Fletcher
                        helped you? Get you ready for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Oh, yes. It had good courses, excellent professors, and classes
                    averaging only five or six students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took your oral exams in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Yes, in the fall of 1936. It was most convenient for me since for the
                    1936-1937 year I was a Fellow at the Brookings Institution near the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall how the oral exam was constituted? Is this
                        one of those things that's engraved in your memory?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: I forget how many there were in the examining group, I guess four or
                    five. Whether they treated everybody the same way, I don't know. I went in, they
                    asked a few questions, and I guess looked me over. I was then told to go on to
                    get a physical exam. This meant I had passed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the types of questions that were
                        asked of you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Not really. Some had to do with international affairs. I don't remember
                    any specific questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So obviously you passed. How did the system in 1937 work?
                        We're still in the depression, government is beginning to expand, but the
                        United States is not a major player in the world in a way. Here you are a
                        young guy just out of college, how did they absorb you into the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Well, they sent everyone right out to a post. I went to Budapest. Some
                    of the officers at those posts were very good at helping young officers. I was
                    rotated through several fields of activity—passports and help to American
                    citizens, visas, and economic reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Budapest and you were there from 1937 to '38,
                        this is normal. Did we have a Legation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: A Legation at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: I forget his first name, [John Flournoy] Montgomery was his last name,
                    a political appointee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was he like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>HAMILTON: Very capable, a pleasant man. The office ran smoothly—thanks in good
                    measure to Howard K. Travers, First Secretary and Consul—and he seemed to get
                    along well with the Hungarians. Since he did not care for opera or concerts, one
                    of my jobs—a most pleasant one—was escorting Mrs. Montgomery to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Hungary in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Well, it was a dictatorship, a benevolent dictatorship. Admiral Horthy
                    was in charge, he was relatively mild. Things ran smoothly. Everything was in
                    order and people seemed content. As far as normal living was concerned, there
                    were no problems. It was a very pleasant life. The Hungarians were a friendly
                    people, at least those in Budapest, the ones I had the most contact with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our Legation doing in those days? What was the
                        main interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Well, I don't know that it had any special interest. Of course I didn't
                    get into that. Although I moved around in various assignments for a few months,
                    it was all really on the consular side. I did some economic reporting, but I
                    never got into any of the political work. As far as I could tell, the Legation
                    was concentrating on keeping Washington informed of whatever of interest was
                    going on. I was not aware of anything special.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the news from Germany and Hitler who was consolidating
                        his power, and consolidating part of Germany, was this a subject of much
                        speculation or interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: It didn't seem to be. Hitler moved into Austria just after I left to
                    come back to the Foreign Service School. I think it took everybody by surprise.
                    When I went through Vienna for a few days on the way back to Washington there
                    didn't seem to be any feeling of an impending German move.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be in '38 when you went back to go to the
                        Foreign Service School. Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long was the course, and what were they teaching?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Three months, I believe. Teaching concerned policy and office
                    operations relating to passports, citizenship, visas, reporting, and other
                    action areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it your impression at that time that the State
                        Department was a pretty small organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Well, not at the time, but looking back at it since, it was small. You
                    got to know most of the officers in Washington, particularly the political
                    officers. At that time there wasn't really much of an economic emphasis. The
                    political officers were all on the third floor...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Old State, now the Executive Office Building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any choice of where you went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: No; toward the end of the School term I just got the assignment one day
                    to Zurich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you married at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went out to Zurich again in 1938, and you were there
                        until 1940. What were you doing in Zurich?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Most of the time visa work, passport too. Visas and passports were most
                    of my official work, but I did a lot of economic reporting on the side,
                    including spare time. It interested me. This was the time the Jews were leaving
                    Germany so the demand for visas was heavy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you were, a young Foreign Service officer, in a
                        country which was becoming...'38, things were really picking up. Munich had
                        happened by this time, had Czechoslovakia been occupied? Austria had been
                        occupied.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Austria yes, in March 1938; Munich occurred in September 1938, as I
                    landed in France headed for Zurich; and Czechoslovakia was occupied in March
                    1939.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our policy, and how did you treat the applicants
                        for Jewish visas? I mean for American visas, not just Jewish, but people
                        coming in, people trying to get the hell out of the way of danger.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Well at that time, of course, one of the first things a prospective
                    immigrant had to have was means of support over here. Without some relative to
                    provide an affidavit of support or somebody who would put up some other form of
                    affidavit, he was generally out of luck, unless he was a professional coming to
                    a specific job or, I think, a domestic with an affidavit from his prospective
                    employer. So it was primarily a matter of trying to determine the adequacy of
                    means of support. Health and police certificates were also required.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel...after the fact, and after the World War and
                        the whole enormity of the holocaust became known, there was considerable
                        criticism of the Department of State Foreign Service attitude on this.
                        Looking at it, and trying to go back to the time, did you feel the
                        pressures—one, to obey the law; but two, here's the problem and were you
                        getting threats from groups in the United States? For example, Jewish groups
                        saying we'll support these people when they come in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: I don't recall myself ever seeing any group offering to help Jewish
                    visa applicants. As far as concerns the work there in Zurich that I was involved
                    in, I never encountered any threats either, but I did sometimes feel squeezed
                    between the law and the need.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Swiss authorities? People coming in
                        applying for visas were mostly non- Swiss I assume. Were they under pressure
                        that if you didn't give them visas they'd be sent back? What was the Swiss
                        attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: I don't recall anybody who indicated that. Some of them did go on. For
                    whatever reasons they left the country and finished up their applications
                    somewhere else, maybe in Spain, Latin America, or elsewhere. Every now and then
                    we'd get a transfer of an application from some other office like Stuttgart or
                    Bucharest where it had been started. Many country quotas were so small in
                    relation to demand that the day of the first application was significant. Few
                    Swiss applied for immigration visas. The Swiss Government seemed fairly liberal
                    about admitting applicants to Switzerland but I never learned the particulars of
                    their rules or policy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: That's right, he was there quite a while. Now that I have the name it's
                    familiar. I may have forgotten, probably because I never met him, never had
                    anything to do with him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The old Foreign Service wasn't that big a group. He was a

                        you were there at the beginning of World War II, September of '39 although
                        it was up in Poland but France was at war. Were the Swiss making defensive
                        movements or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Well, not what I'd call movements, but they started to put up tank
                    barricades along the frontier and on bridges over the Rhine in Basel. They
                    increased military training and called some to active duty.</p>

                <p>HAMILTON: Well, it didn't affect the work of the Consulate General particularly
                    while I was still there. In our daily life what was most affected was the
                    gasoline supply. It was severely rationed. For consular purposes there was a
                    place where you could get a reasonable supply, but they didn't want you driving
                    all over the place just because you could get some gas. Road traffic dropped way
                    down.</p>

                <p>HAMILTON: Well, by train to Genoa, and got on an Italian liner, the Conte
                    Biancamano, and then to Singapore. We had the Italian minister of colonies
                    aboard, he was on an inspection trip to their then colony Eritrea, on the Red
                    Sea.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Massawa was the port where we stopped and Asmara was the capital of the

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would have been Ethiopia, or Eritrea. The Italians

                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Yes Eritrea. Then we went on making stops at Aden, Bombay, and Ceylon;
                    so it took a while, a pleasant cruise. At Singapore I got off, and then waited a
                    week until I could get a small French ship to Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in Saigon February '40. What was your
                        job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: There were two of us. The consul at first was Peter Flood, I was the
                    vice consul. We did everything. The Cochinchina government operated fairly
                    independently. The Governor General was in Hanoi, but we were responsible for
                    the reporting and other actions as a legation or an embassy would have been. We
                    communicated directly with the Department but sent copies of some things to
                    Paris while the embassy was still there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Saigon like in early 1940?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>HAMILTON: It was a pleasant and interesting situation, except that we felt cut
                    off. It was all right up until May 1940 when Paris fell. There was regular
                    steamship travel; a ship called once a week or every ten days en route from
                    France to China and Japan and back. Other ships also called. People weren't
                    worried particularly about anything. So life was good; a few shortages but quite
                    pleasant calm. Then, after the German armistice in June, the French really felt
                    cut off, left high and dry. Admiral Decoux, a Vichy sympathizer, became Governor
                    General and General Catreux left and joined the Free French</p>
                <p>Admiral Decoux was given a large measure of authority and was also appointed High
                    Commissioner for all French possessions in the Pacific. He had authority but
                    meager resources, physical contact with France having essentially ceased.
                    Supplies began to be short, so he had to try to develop increased commercial
                    relations with the Philippines and Hong Kong particularly.</p>
                <p>Within a month after the fall of France the Japanese began moving into Tonkin,
                    the northern part of Indochina, in various ways, first with inspectors on the
                    railway running to Yunnanfu in China. There were military clashes in September
                    1940 at Caobang and Lang Son on the Indochina-Chinese border.</p>
                <p>Then the Japanese began making economic demands. They wanted all the rubber and
                    much of the rice, and other things. They promised to pay, but actually all they
                    did was to give vouchers. Generally they needed all their own supplies for
                    themselves and sent little to Indochina.</p>
                <p>By the beginning of '41 gasoline was running short. The French began mixing some
                    rice alcohol in with it, and developed what they called gazogenes, an engine
                    able to run on charcoal gas used first in buses and then some cars. Other things
                    began to be scarce, including new movies. Life was more somber then than it had
                    been, with fewer balls and parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your observation, how was the French Colonial world?
                        Were Vietnamese integrated into the colonial structure, or were you dealing
                        with the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: We dealt with the French almost exclusively. Even in the provinces the
                    top man was always French. Outside of Saigon the French themselves, however,
                    mingled more with the native people than the British tended to do in their
                    colonies. The French also seemed to marry natives more often than the British
                    did. But the French had their schools, their lycee system. There was a
                    university at Hanoi, but the French usually went to universities in France.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>A certain amount of unrest developed among the Vietnamese towards the end of
                    1940. It got rather serious. I don't know who was behind it. There was
                    considerable feeling that the Japanese were. French officials referred to
                    “communist” disturbances. The French arrested a large number of people and put
                    many of them on an island off the coast, Poulo Condore, where they had a penal
                    colony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like Devil's Island.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Hamilton. Yes. Poulo Condore is about 90 miles east of the southern end of
                    Indochina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were Vietnamese coming to you as an American
                        representative to let you know how much they resented the French? Were they
                        using this, or were we pretty much a neutral?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: We were pretty neutral. The Vietnamese hardly ever showed up at the
                    consulate, or elsewhere. We had a few Chinese who would come over and whom we
                    knew fairly well—businessmen, or commercial folks, rice dealers, or something of
                    that sort. But it was rare when a Vietnamese came into the consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the major work you were doing then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Well, there was no visa work and practically no passport work. Most of
                    the time it was political and economic reporting. There was quite a bit of
                    economic reporting because Indochina was a rich country with a lot of production
                    and export of rice, rubber, metals, and various things of that sort. A lot of
                    political reporting was necessary at that time. It got so heavy and we were so
                    far from Hanoi, the capital, that the Department sent down Charles Reed from
                    Shanghai primarily to do political reporting in Hanoi. He got a room or two,
                    opened a little office in a hotel, and took over much of the political
                    reporting. Normal consular matters he would usually refer to us in Saigon.
                    People visited him but he did not really operate an office for the public,
                    particularly not for consular services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say political reporting, was this basically about
                        what the Japanese were up to more than anything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Yes, plus the policies and attitudes of the French and problems with
                    Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your attitude, and others with you in the
                        consulate there, towards the French, after the fall of France? The British
                        during 1940 were going through the Battle of Britain and it was a very
                        difficult time, and the Vichy French and the British went in and attacked
                        the French navy in Algeria and in Dakar. I'm not talking about our attitude.
                        I'm talking about your attitude and people around you towards the regime in
                        Saigon at that time as this news came out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Personally we were naturally pro-British and Free French. The local
                    government people, of course, could only present one front but not always with
                    much enthusiasm. It was pro-Vichy, and Petain still had the respect of a good
                    many people, even though it turned out he couldn't do much. On the other hand,
                    there was also quite an anti-British feeling. Many felt that the British had let
                    them down. Then there were plenty of the French looking to the U.S., and many
                    were friendly towards it. Others just wanted to wait and see...they were
                    completely taken aback about what had happened, and didn't feel up to much of
                    anything. They were worried about the Japanese coming into the north. Initially
                    they didn't think this would cause problems in the south.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Well, the Japanese did come down. From behind the scenes, they had good
                    control of things up north by September 1940, and then gradually worked down to
                    the south. They had control there by August of '41, and began landing
                    troops.</p>
                <p>An AP correspondent, Relman Morin, tried to trail around the country to find out
                    where all these Japanese soldiers and equipment were going. You could see that
                    they had largely taken over the Saigon airport. This was the only place in the
                    Saigon area where they constructed barracks and kept troops and planes. They
                    also built or improved airfields and barracks in other parts of Cochinchina and
                    Cambodia, took over other buildings and some homes by working through the
                    French, erected small radio stations, and strung telephone and telegraph lines
                    widely.</p>
                <p>In November, the Japanese began following us to see where we were going. You'd
                    see them not far behind when you moved about Saigon or out into the
                    countryside.</p>

                    They asked for it, and the French pretty much obliged. Various economic and
                    other agreements were the front for things the Japanese wanted. There was little
                    else the French could do if they wanted to maintain at least nominal control. No
                    help was available from France.</p>
                <p>The French were never heavily armed in Indochina. Some 40,000 native troops and
                    workmen had been sent to France after the outbreak of war in Europe, and by the
                    time the Japanese moved into southern Indochina their forces exceeded the
                    French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the general feeling? Why were the Japanese there?
                        Why were they putting troops in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Well, that was the question. There was some speculation that they had
                    in mind Malaya, now Malaysia, but nobody knew and that really didn't seem
                    likely. Although things were pointing in that direction, people couldn't believe
                    it. In fact, however, that was what it proved to be all about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have military attach�s down there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: No. The nearest military attach� was in Bangkok. He came over once, I
                    don't remember just when, for a few days, probably shortly after the fall of
                    France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be June of 1940.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: I think it was soon after. All I remember is that he came for a brief
                    visit. He may have gone on to Hanoi, I'm not sure about that either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is before Japan went to war with us, any problems
                        with our operation, outside of being followed a little?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: On the whole, no. On Sunday evening, November 23, 1941, however, the
                    Japanese gendarmerie, which was a military police organization, put a bomb
                    against the door of the consulate (which was in an office/apartment building)
                    and blew the consulate apart.</p>
                <p>I had an apartment across a little park, about a block away, so I heard the
                    noise. Our American clerk, who lived a floor or two above was badly scared and
                    shaken up. I went over and saw the office was essentially demolished. A lot of
                    smoke and dust were pouring out the door.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>In the morning we got in touch with the French who knew all about it by that
                    time. We were able to get some space in the Bank of Indochina on its top floor.
                    We operated there from November 24th to December 8th, when the Japanese took us
                    into custody and stopped all our operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Japanese seen to do this? I mean was this
                        blatant, or was this supposedly done by Vietnamese terrorists? How did this
                        bomb...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: I know of no witnesses. The French looked into it and told Sidney
                    Browne, the consul, what we all thought, that it was the Japanese gendarmerie
                    who had done it. I don't know how firm the evidence was. We never had any
                    evidence, I don't believe, of any animus among the natives toward us. We thought
                    it quite unlikely that any of them who were operating against the French would
                    have done it. Why the Japanese would have, is hard to say too. It might have
                    tipped their hand. I do not recall that the Department responded to our reports,
                    but it must have even though it would have been very busy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, by the time it was absorbed the balloon had gone up.
                        In that part of the world it was December 8th when the Pearl Harbor attack
                        came. What happened with you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: I guess it was about 2:30 in the morning in Saigon that low flying
                    planes awakened me, and soon a Japanese squad (a lieutenant, an interpreter, and
                    several men with fixed bayonets) pounded on my apartment door, and said, “Open
                    up.” When I opened up they handed me a mimeographed statement from the
                    Headquarters of the Nippon Army that said we were at war and that I had to stay
                    there until further word.</p>
                <p>They did the same with Sidney Browne and the British, although they missed one of
                    the British vice consuls. We were all kept in our quarters until arrangements
                    were made.</p>
                <p>The British owned a large residence for their Consul General. The U.S. didn't own
                    any property, and I don't know just how it was arranged that we would all be put
                    into the British residence. But after three or four days later we were moved
                    over there, with our servants and a radio. The AP correspondent, Relman Morin,
                    was also brought in, as well as the head of the British and American Tobacco
                    Company office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do? What were you up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>HAMILTON: We weren't up to anything. The British Consul General and Sidney Browne
                    negotiated a little bit with the Japanese who said they would put a couple of
                    guards in the front of the house, and they would not go into the rest of the
                    house at all. So our guards sat there in a small room and we organized ways of
                    passing the time; some reading, some writing, listening to the news which wasn't
                    very encouraging, and often bridge in the evening (which is how I learned to
                    play the game).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The first six months particularly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: One bad military situation after another. But the servants were allowed
                    to go out marketing every day, so we had a good food supply. They could also do
                    the laundry regularly. There were shortages, of course, which affected
                    everyone.</p>
                <p>The residence had a fairly large grounds so we could get out and exercise every
                    day. We made a deck tennis court and a miniature golf course.</p>
                <p>It was somewhat monotonous, but not too bad a life. You had no responsibilities,
                    nothing you had to do. The AP man, of course, was accustomed to being on the go
                    all the time; so found it very restricting. The rest of us didn't find it quite
                    so bad in that respect. We got along all right together for the most part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big was the Consulate General, or was it a
                        Consulate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: For the British it was a Consulate General.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For us it was a Consulate. How big was the American
                        staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Americans, just the two of us (officers) and an American clerk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the two of you and the American clerk was a woman. She
                        was also interned too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: No, she wasn't. She had to check into the police once a week, but
                    stayed in her apartment. I don't know that it was particularly agreeable,
                    especially going out. People couldn't be too friendly with her. But anyhow, she
                    was on her own. The whole staff of the Consulate was still very small. We had a
                    French clerk, a lady, who kept the accounts, and acted as an administrative
                    officer; an Indian clerk who helped handle the mail room, helped gather data for
                    some reports, and a few other things; a janitor/messenger. That was it.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this play out? You could hear the news, they
                        didn't take your radio away.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: No, we always had a radio. In fact we had a couple. Well, the Swiss
                    consul was finally put in charge of American interests and became the contact
                    between the Department, the Japanese, and ourselves. I don't know just when that
                    occurred, but it was a while before he was able to get over to see us. Even then
                    what he could say was restricted since the Japanese listened in. He was the
                    outside contact and if we needed money or anything else, we had to get it
                    through him. He could arrange for us to go to a dentist, or a doctor if
                    necessary, accompanied by a guard, which we had to do a few times. All the
                    information regarding the exchange arrangement that came along ultimately, came
                    through him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But how did it play out? I mean, how did they get you out?
                        How did you leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Well, the Japanese finally started two exchange ships, the Asama Maru
                    in Yokohama and the Conte Verde in Shanghai. Passengers were mainly diplomatic
                    personnel, but also many missionaries and some newspaper correspondents. The
                    Asama Maru stopped at Hong Kong before reaching Saigon on July 3rd when we were
                    put aboard. On July 4th we went back down the Saigon River to Cap St.Jacques
                    where those who had been brought over from the Bangkok Legation also boarded. We
                    then went on to Singapore to meet the Conte Verde with its passengers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be 1942.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Yes. We couldn't go ashore and didn't dock in Singapore, but anchored
                    out in the harbor for a day or two, on one of which the Japanese gave a military
                    air display. From Singapore the ship was all lit up and marked. We were routed
                    south through the Sunda Straits, and across the Indian Ocean into Lourenco
                    Marques in Portuguese East Africa, or Mozambique, on July 23rd. We were saluted
                    by sirens, streams of water and cheers from the many ships in the harbor.</p>
                <p>The Japanese diplomats from the U.S. had arrived on the Gripsholm the day before
                    and the exchange was made the following day. They left fairly promptly but it
                    was about a week before the Gripsholm was ready to start back. Then it was still
                    a long way around Cape Horn, over to Rio, and then up to New York, staying out
                    of regular shipping lanes as much as possible. We finally sailed into New York
                    harbor past the Statue of Liberty on August 25th.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they do with you? Here you were obviously waiting
                        for another assignment, but we were well into the war by this time. What
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>HAMILTON: Well, when I got back here I resigned from the Department and found
                    that although I was hardly an expert on Indochina, most people in Washington
                    were less so. So I started spending half my week on Indochina with what was
                    first the Board of Economic Warfare and then the Foreign Economic
                    Administration, and the other half working also on Indochina in the Pentagon
                    with G-2. Sometime in '44, I went back to the Department as desk officer for the
                    Dominions except Canada in the Division of British Commonwealth Affairs. Soon
                    after the UN conference in San Francisco in 1945 I became an assistant to the
                    Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and later moved on to President
                    Truman's Point-4 Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were dealing with the Indochina back
                        in Washington, were we getting much information out of there? Or how did we
                        find out, because this was deep in the Japanese territory at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: No, you didn't get an awful lot, but still a fair amount. The 14th Air
                    Force was operating in China out of Kunming, and they could take photographs.
                    People would come up into the southern China area and the embassy in Chungking
                    picked up information. Mountbatten's command in Ceylon was also a source of
                    information. Of course, OSS got into the picture and there was a good deal of
                    message interception.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, radio intercepts of traffic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: And occasionally the military would get worthwhile information from
                    prisoner interrogation. Now and then individuals would get out so some place
                    where they could provide information, not always accurately, we found.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do thereafter? In 1944 you say you came to
                        the State Department in Commonwealth Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Yes, British Commonwealth Affairs. I had the Australian, New Zealand,
                    South African, and Ireland desks. Then after Mr. Clayton, Will Clayton, became
                    first the Assistant Secretary and then the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs,
                    I became an assistant to him and, when he left, to Willard Thorp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me a bit about Will Clayton? He's one of
                        the major figures in the Department of State in economic affairs. What was
                        his style of operation as you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>HAMILTON: Well, he was very hard working, gracious, knowledgeable, considerate, a
                    leader, and one who tried to get into the substance of things thoroughly
                    himself. He'd outline what he wanted to do at regular staff meetings and his
                    office directors would try to do it. For routine matters, he relied first on his
                    Deputy Willard Thorp who would hold the regular staff meetings once or twice a
                    week with the four office directors. The offices were International Trade
                    Policy, Financial and Development Policy, Transport and Communications, and
                    Economic Security Policy. On important problems, Mr. Clayton worked closely with
                    the office directors. He had good relations around the rest of the government.
                    People found him pleasant and easy to work with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Assistant Secretary, and then became Under
                        Secretary William L. Clayton, and in 1947 he left the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Yes, or in early 1948 after he had helped conceive and start the
                    Marshall Plan (European Recovery Program). Then in early 1949 the rest of us
                    helped develop President Truman's Point-4 or Technical Assistance Program and I
                    shifted to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you continued as it moved into ICA and AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: It changed names. First it was TCA (Technical Cooperation
                    Administration, within the State Department), then part of FOA (Foreign
                    Operations Administration). When Eisenhower came in, and Stassen took over FOA,
                    they made a study to enable them to put in as many Republicans as possible. This
                    pretty well cleaned out people from the original TCA. I got a job with Air Force
                    Intelligence, and that later became part of DIA (Defense Intelligence
                    Agency).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think with people who were fired when Stassen came in,
                        the term was they were Stassenated. This interview covers the time
                        particularly I wanted to pick up about Saigon which I found very, very
                        interesting. I served in Saigon much later in '69-'70, and it was quite a
                        different ball game. This was to give you an idea. I was Consul General in
                        Saigon and I ranked just in the upper half of the diplomatic list. I don't
                        think I talked to the ambassador more than once or twice. It was a huge
                        embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: The only other thing I mentioned in that letter I wrote you was
                    fighting between Thailand and Indochina.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>As indicated earlier today, the Japanese had established their control of Tonkin
                    by September 1940. In November, military skirmishing broke out between Thai and
                    French frontier forces on the Cambodian border, soon reaching the scale of
                    undeclared war. The apparent immediate source of the situation was a Thai
                    demand, which the French refused, for an adjustment of the frontier,
                    particularly with regard to some islands in the Mekong River. Many people saw a
                    connection between this development and the arrival of the Japanese in
                    Indochina.</p>
                <p>Any remaining French reserves were called up and put on the fighting line. At
                    least in southern Indochina, the principal cities were blacked out at night and
                    there was some air activity. Civilians were evacuated from some border towns and
                    the inhabitants of the picturesque Burmese precious stone mining village of
                    Pailin, just within Cambodia, abandoned their homes to return to Burma. It was
                    still deserted when I visited the area in March 1941.</p>
                <p>After about two months of relatively heavy military activity between the French
                    and Thai forces in which the Thais were gaining, the Japanese Government offered
                    to mediate. They called a conference aboard a Japanese cruiser at Saigon where
                    an armistice was signed on January 28, 1941.</p>
                <p>Under the final peace agreement signed in Tokyo on March 11, 1941 the French
                    ceded to Thailand about one-tenth of the total area of Indochina. This was
                    mostly in Cambodia, and included its richest province of Battambang but excluded
                    the ancient Angkor ruins. I believe Thailand had to give up this territory at
                    the end of World War II.</p>
                <p>It was in the midst of the hostilities with Thailand that the internal native
                    disturbances that I mentioned earlier occurred in parts of Cochinchina and to
                    some extent in Tonkin. Their rather severe suppression and sending some of those
                    rounded up to the Poulo Condore penal colony undoubtedly had a correspondingly
                    unfortunate attitude and temper of many Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you're adding some interesting areas that aren't
                        covered; the Thais fighting essentially the French to take over part of
                        Indochina, and also what happened to our Consulate in Saigon. Just to be
                        clear, up in Hanoi, we had a Consulate General up there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: Well, all we had was the political officer, Charles S. Reed, who was
                    sent down from Shanghai, plus an American clerk, Iris Johnston. I don't think
                    the British had anybody up there. The Japanese moved Mr. Reed around a good deal
                    under harsher conditions than ours in Saigon. Then on June 18 he was brought to
                    join us.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Mr. Reed had not really operated an office for the public. He was there to report
                    and have direct contact with Admiral Decoux's office. This caused some problems
                    for Miss Johnston. She was at liberty until January 29, 1942, but then the
                    Japanese held her in solitary custody for two months during which she was
                    severely questioned in an apparent effort to learn about Mr. Reed's sources of
                    information. She was then allowed to go to the mountain resort of Da Lat in
                    Annam because of her health, and was brought to join the rest of us in Saigon a
                    few days before the Asama Maru's departure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, I want to thank you very much. It has been really
                        very interesting. I appreciate it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAMILTON: You're quite welcome.</p>
                <p>ADDENDUMFRENCH INDOCHINA</p>
                <p>Summary of Developments during the FirstSeven Months of War in the Pacific</p>
                <p>Kingsley W. Hamilton American Vice Consul</p>
                <p>August 4, 1942</p>
                <p>l. Outbreak of the War:</p>
                <p>The Department has been informed of developments through December 6, 1941. On the
                    morning of December 7 the Japanese military authorities completely closed off
                    the Saigon airport which had hitherto been partially accessible to the public.
                    By the same afternoon very few Japanese vessels were left in port. Between 2:00
                    a.m. and 3:00 a.m. December 8 a large formation of Japanese planes flew over the
                    city. Later that morning the inhabitants of the city awoke to find notices
                    posted in French, Chinese, and Annamite indicating that war had broken out
                    between Japan and the United States.</p>
                <p>2. Treatment of Consular Officers:</p>
                <p>All consular officers, with the exception of a British Vice Consul, were roused
                    from their beds and placed under custody by the Japanese military authorities
                    about 3:00 a.m. December 8. In Saigon they were presented a mimeographed sheet
                    giving the reasons for this action and outlining the conditions of the treatment
                    to be expected. The American Consul had some slight contact with two French
                    policemen stationed before his residence, but was soon cautioned not to speak to
                    them. The American Vice Consul never saw any French official. The acting British
                    Consul General was able to deal through a French liaison officer for about a
                    day. When one of the British Vice Consuls reported to the acting Consul General
                    at his residence about 9:00 a.m. December 8, he was taken into custody.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>American consular officers were taken to the temporary quarters of the Consulate
                    for a few minutes on the morning of December 8 while the office was given a
                    preliminary search, their living quarters having been previously searched.</p>
                <p>The two American consular officers in Saigon were held in their respective
                    residences until December 11 when they were removed to the British consular
                    residence. Here they remained quite comfortably until July 3, 1942 when they
                    boarded the M.S. ASAMA MARU.</p>
                <p>The American Consul in Hanoi was held for a time alone in a room of a building
                    not far from the Hotel Metropole where he had resided. Later he was moved to a
                    house furnished for him by the French Government General but where he was still
                    under Japanese guard. Still later he was removed to the premises of the Standard
                    Vacuum Oil Company in Haiphong; from there to a Japanese military camp on the
                    outskirts of Haiphong; and from there to a private house in Haiphong. He
                    received much harsher treatment than the officers in Saigon. Much of the time he
                    was alone; the rest of the time the British Reuters correspondent was with him.
                    On June 18, 1942 he was also transferred to the British consular residence in
                    Saigon.</p>
                <p>The British consular officer in Haiphong was at first confined with his family
                    above the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, but was soon removed to a small private house
                    where he has remained with other British subjects in Haiphong. The men have been
                    obliged to remain within the premises, but the women have been free to go into
                    the city during the day. The French wife of one of the men actually boards with
                    her family.</p>
                <p>3. Treatment of American Consular Personnel Other Than Officers.</p>
                <p>In Saigon American clerk Miss Carolyn C. Jacobs was not molested. She lived
                    normally in her apartment and reported once weekly to the French police.</p>
                <p>In Hanoi American Clerk Miss Iris Johnston was at liberty until January 29. She
                    was then held in solitary custody for about two months when she was allowed to
                    proceed to the hill station of Da Lat in southern Annam for reasons of health.
                    She was subjected to severe questioning apparently with the primary object of
                    obtaining information regarding the sources of information used by Consul
                    Charles S. Reed II.</p>
                <p>Other employees of the Consulate in Saigon have not been hampered in their
                    movements. French Clerk Mme. Petra has been re-employed by the Swiss Consul, but
                    other employees are finding it difficult to obtain new positions.</p>
                <p>4. Treatment of Other American and British Nationals:</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>With the following exceptions American and British nationals in Southern
                    Indochina have been at liberty and obliged merely to report to the French police
                    once weekly. They have had to abandon commercial activity but have been able to
                    carry on missionary work.</p>
                <p>The exceptions are: (1) The American correspondent of the Associated Press was
                    taken into custody on December 12 and brought to the British consular residence
                    on December 13 to remain until July 3: (2) The British manager of the French
                    Manufactures Indochinoises des Cigarettes, an employee of the British and
                    American Tobacco Company, was held with the American Consul from the first; (3)
                    All officers of the British banks in Saigon were held from December 8 to
                    December 31; (4) The Canadian representative of the Singer Sewing Machine
                    Company was held in jail under harsh treatment for 59 days from January 29; (5)
                    A British accountant of the Standard Vacuum Oil Company was similarly held for
                    about 68 days; (6) A British employee of the firm until recently known as
                    Dreyfus and Cie. was similarly held; (7) A Filipino no longer entitled to the
                    protection of the United States while abroad was held for a month and then
                    turned over to the French on a charge of illegal possession of firearms. The
                    object of the treatment given the three British subjects, as well as one Dutch
                    subject not mentioned above, was to obtain information regarding the affairs of
                    their firms and to break their spirit so that they would consent to work for the
                    Japanese as one or two are now reported to be doing.</p>
                <p>In northern Indochina the treatment given American and British nationals differed
                    only in the fact that men have not been at liberty at all while women have been
                    able to go shopping, et cetera during the day. A naturalized Philippine citizen
                    of Swiss-American origin by the name of Corvissiano was picked up by the
                    Japanese on January 29 and apparently held in much the same manner as those
                    taken into custody in southern Indochina at that time. The British Reuters
                    correspondent has been held from the first, part of the time alone, part of the
                    time with the American Consul, and latterly with the other British in
                    Haiphong.</p>
                <p>5. Treatment of Chinese:</p>
                <p>The Chinese Consul at Saigon, who had remained closely sheltered in a villa at
                    the hill station of Da Lat for some time prior to the outbreak of war, is
                    reported so far to have eluded the Japanese together with his subordinate
                    officers. However, it is not positively known whether he managed to escape the
                    country and, accordingly, the Japanese are holding three of the local clerks in
                    jail until they give information regarding the consul's whereabouts. The
                    treatment given these men is so severe that it is not believed they can long
                    survive.</p>
                <p>Other Chinese in Cholon (Saigon) are also harshly treated. They are picked up
                    indiscriminately, imprisoned, and tortured until they consent to report weekly
                    on anti-Japanese activities.</p>
                <p>6. Treatment of Consular Establishments:</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>The American Consul in Saigon refused to open the consular safes, but on December
                    12 or 13 the Japanese Gendarmerie delivered to the consular officers their
                    personal belongings which had been in the safes. Evidently the safes were forced
                    open and the Japanese obtained the Brown and Grey codes, readings and copies of
                    all telegrams, blank passports, and all confidential matter.</p>
                <p>The Japanese always pretended to know nothing of any other regular office of the
                    Consulate. Accordingly, the only other archives which they seem to have obtained
                    were the current files. All other archives and most of the furniture were still
                    in the office damaged by the bomb explosion on November 23. The Consulate's
                    French clerk, Mme. Paulette Petra, managed to remove these to her home in the
                    first day or two following the outbreak of war and is believed still to have
                    them in her possession.</p>
                <p>The Japanese also obtained consular files in Hanoi. The safe has been returned to
                    the Swiss consular agent in Haiphong, but is believed to have been previously
                    opened.</p>
                <p>The British Consulate General in Saigon was taken over by the Japanese naval
                    rather than military authorities. British officers have never been taken back to
                    the office and do not know what action has been taken with regard to it. Since
                    the British Vice Consul in Haiphong is an employee of the Chartered Bank, it is
                    presumed that any documents he had were taken over with those of the bank.</p>
                <p>7. Political and Military Developments:</p>
                <p>A further Franco-Japanese agreement was signed on December 9, 1941, but its
                    contents are not known. Somewhat later the Vichy Government appointed Governor
                    General Jean Decoux as High Commissioner for all French possessions in the
                    Pacific.</p>
                <p>It is reliably reported that the French cruiser Lamotte Picquet has remained
                    continually in French waters. The sloop Amiral Charner has probably so remained.
                    Nothing is known regarding the movements of the single French submarine which
                    was in Indochina and under repair on December 8 except that it has been repaired
                    and was in Saigon on July 3.</p>
                <p>It is reliably reported that much of the Japanese air offensive against the
                    Allies in the early weeks of the Pacific war was directed from Indochina. The
                    planes which bombed Manila are understood to have left from Nha Trang just north
                    of Camranh Bay in Annam and those which bombed Singapore from Baclieu and
                    Soctrang just south of the mouth of the Mekong in Cochinchina. In the early days
                    of the war damaged planes were frequently seen to return to these points, often
                    to crash before landing.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Most of the active planes have now left the Saigon area for unknown destinations,
                    but there is every reason to believe that Saigon itself is being used as a
                    repair base not only for planes but also for trucks and other mechanized
                    equipment. It is definitely known, for instance, that the foundry belonging to
                    the French firm of Faci (Forges, Ateliers, Chartiers Indochinois) and located
                    about 300 yards up the Arroyo Chinois from the Saigon River is straightening
                    propeller blades for the Japanese.</p>
                <p>The Japanese have completed the 60 kilometers of railway between Mongkol Borey in
                    the province of Battambang, formerly in Cambodia, and the Thai city of Muong
                    Aran Pradhet thus linking Phnom Penh with Singapore by rail. They are now
                    reported to be bringing their supplies and troops down the Chinese coast by
                    vessel and through the channel between Hainan Island and the mainland to
                    Haiphong. From Haiphong transportation is by rail to Saigon, by truck from
                    Saigon to Phnom Penh, and by rail from Phnom Penh to points beyond in Thailand
                    or Malaya. Thus the hazardous voyage down the Indochinese coast and across the
                    Gulf of Siam is avoided.</p>
                <p>It is probably because of this increased traffic that express shipments have been
                    suspended on the Saigon-Hanoi-Haiphong railroad. The extra wear on equipment
                    which cannot be replaced is also probably responsible for the increased number
                    of wrecks which are occurring on the Indochinese railways.</p>
                <p>It was reported on July 3 that the Japanese plan to move most of their troops
                    from Indochina to other fronts, leaving only a police force of about 6,000 men.
                    This would ameliorate conditions for the French considerably, but would not
                    necessarily affect the transit of supplies through Indochina. Accordingly, the
                    railway, which is extremely vulnerable at several points, particularly where it
                    runs with the highway, would remain a worthwhile bombing objective. (1)</p>
                <p>A Canadian artillery unit of about 1,000 men from Singapore, as well as
                    Australian and Indian troops, has been in Saigon for some time as prisoners of
                    war. The men are employed on the docks, in general throughout the port area, and
                    at the airport. Their quarters except those of the Indians are in the port area
                    about 200 yards from the river. Six have died; two have tried to escape — with
                    what results is not known. Their food is believed to be poor. A considerable
                    group outside is working secretly to ameliorate their conditions. In this the
                    Annamites took the initiative under the leadership of Dr. and Mrs. Tranh van
                    Doc, 16 Boulevard de la Somme, Saigon, but there are also French working through
                    several men in the Surete and Mme. Gaillard, the Vogue Dress Shop, Rue Catinat,
                    Saigon. The Indians are quartered at Nhabe on the Soirap River 15 kilometers
                    south of Saigon.</p>
                <p>Practically all French merchant shipping has been taken over by the Japanese and
                    now flies the Japanese flag. Most of the vessels have left Saigon and some are
                    reported to have been damaged already. Efforts are being made by the Government
                    General to locate the 850 men from their crews in shore positions in
                    Indochina.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Allied submarines appear to be effective off the Indochinese coast, for the
                    French now consider Saigon a dangerous port from which to sail.</p>
                <p>The Allied bombings of the Hanoi airport are reported to have done considerable
                    damage in spite of the offhand manner in which they were treated by the French
                    press. At least one American pilot by the name of Bishop from California is now
                    interned at Saigon.</p>
                <p>Japanese participation in the administrative affairs of Indochina has increased
                    since the beginning of the war. They censor the postal and telegraph services,
                    using a French stamp, and listen to telephone conversations. On one occasion
                    they even arrested the Director of Posts and Telegraphs and held him a few hours
                    because one of his subordinates had interfered with one of their own telegraph
                    lines. Later the director was replaced.</p>
                <p>The Japanese seem particularly anxious to take over the administration of
                    justice. To prevent their having any excuse for doing so the French are becoming
                    increasingly severe in law enforcement, generally convicting and inflicting
                    heavy penalties, particularly on Europeans.</p>
                <p>There is good reason to believe that the Japanese are compiling evidence for a
                    “White Book” or some such document to be issued in justification of their action
                    when they are ready openly to take over the administration of Indochina. The
                    basis of this book is apparently to be an exposure of French morals; for, in the
                    questioning to which they have subjected many persons this has been one of the
                    principal points on which they have endeavored to obtain statements.</p>
                <p>It also appears that the Japanese may be trying to gain influence with certain
                    sections of the population by selling them drugs in much the same manner they
                    adopted in North China. The French opium monopoly is short of opium and the
                    Japanese have brought some heroin and cocaine into the country. The French are
                    reported to have increased the area devoted to poppy cultivation in Laos, but
                    the crop is not yet ready. In this connection it is also reliably reported that
                    opium smoking has increased greatly in Hanoi since the outbreak of war,
                    particularly among the women who have lost hope of returning to France.</p>
                <p>8. Economic Developments</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Economic conditions in French Indochina have steadily deteriorated since December
                    8, 1941. Business activity is negligible. Supplies of all imported products are
                    extremely low or have already been exhausted. What remains is generally strictly
                    rationed. Wheat flour was exhausted within a few weeks after the outbreak of
                    war; butter and margarine can no longer be purchased except occasionally on the
                    black market; potatoes are a rarity; medical supplies are very low; wines are
                    exhausted and liquors practically so; chemicals for the manufacture of matches
                    are deficient; lubricating oils have to be cleaned and re-cleaned because fresh
                    oil is lacking; iron and steel for construction purposes can scarcely be had;
                    and machinery is not obtainable. Even supplies of some domestic products such as
                    fruit, charcoal, fish, and vegetables are inadequate, primarily because they are
                    bought up by the Japanese. Milk supplies are exceedingly low. What canned milk
                    remains is reserved solely for infants and the sick. All fresh milk in the
                    Saigon area is now being pasteurized for the same purposes, but it is doubtful
                    whether it will be adequate for the need.</p>
                <p>Although the Government General endeavors to prevent profiteering and to control
                    prices, it does not try to maintain prices at any given point. Accordingly, both
                    prices and the cost of living have greatly increased since December 8, 1941.</p>
                <p>The Government General has also intensified its efforts, begun some time ago, to
                    encourage the development of substitutes for deficient commodities. Thus, a
                    relatively satisfactory flour is now made from a mixture of 70 percent rice and
                    30 percent maize flour. The production of oil from peanuts, castor beans,
                    coconuts, fish, and millions of rats caught in the rice fields has greatly
                    increased and is used for illumination, other household purposes, and industrial
                    fuel. Soya bean milk, certain toilet articles such as powder, and food
                    side-lines such as jams and jellies and some alcoholic beverages are also being
                    produced. The production of industrial alcohol, principally from rice, for motor
                    fuel has been further increased, but it is now being mixed with 10 percent water
                    according to the Swiss Consul in Saigon. This has probably become necessary
                    because the Japanese are known to be using alcohol and charcoal in some of their
                    trucks.</p>
                <p>The Government General has also established an agricultural credit society
                    organized on a sectional basis to foster the production of various crops in
                    different regions throughout the country, to lend money for this purpose, and to
                    purchase the resulting output.</p>
                <p>Even fewer supplies than before the war are arriving from Japan, although the
                    higher prices keep goods in the stores longer. Some shipments reported to have
                    left Japan have never arrived, and one cargo of milk is said definitely to have
                    been sunk.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The 1941-1942 rice crop is reported to have been good and the maize crop poor.
                    Further details are not available, but a good rice crop is one which would
                    provide about 1.5 million tons for export after domestic consumption had been
                    provided for in all the territory formerly belonging to Indochina. Without the
                    Cambodian province of Battambang ceded to Thailand in 1941 a good exportable
                    surplus would be about 150,000 tons less. All rice exports are going to Japan,
                    or Japanese occupied areas. It seems probable that much of it goes by rail to
                    Haiphong and only from there by the empty vessels which have brought military
                    supplies.</p>
                <p>It is understood that most of the rubber is being stored for the time being.</p>
                <p>The financial position of the Government General of Indochina probably
                    deteriorated further during the first seven months of the war, but may not be as
                    bad as might at first be supposed. On the one hand charges incurred on behalf of
                    the Japanese army continued; revenue from import and export duties was low and,
                    as from July 1, the Government General assumed the payment to landlords of the
                    rent due on premises which had been requisitioned and which continue to be
                    requisitioned for the Japanese and on which the Japanese seldom pay more than a
                    month's rent. On the other hand large sums of money normally sent to France,
                    particularly by business firms, have remained in Indochina; payments due abroad
                    for imports are negligible; and taxes have been increased either through raising
                    the rates, lowering the exemptions, or both.</p>
                <p>9. Axis Propaganda:</p>
                <p>Two types of propaganda are being conducted in Indochina; the Japanese in favor
                    of themselves and co-property for all Asiatics in a greater Asia, and the French
                    in behalf of French administration in general and the Vichy government in
                    particular.</p>
                <p>The Japanese propaganda consists principally in showing Japanese motion pictures,
                    news reels of the war, and educational films; staging exhibitions of Japanese
                    art, particularly painting; bringing dramatic and other artists from Japan;
                    distributing pamphlets and other literature; and publishing a large illustrated
                    weekly newspaper. The Japanese also allow nothing derogatory of themselves or
                    especially favorable to the Allies to appear in the French or vernacular press
                    or to go over the radio. The French press, in fact, features Domei despatches
                    and for the most part prints its selected Allied despatches in the final page.
                    It is doubtful whether this Japanese propaganda is effective.</p>
                <p>French propaganda features motion picture films and the publication in various
                    forms of material on the achievements of France in Indochina. A fair which
                    served this purpose was held in Hanoi in December 1941 and another is to be held
                    in Saigon in December of this year. Every effort is being made to make the
                    natives believe that the French still control the country, while social and
                    other functions are staged to convince the natives of the French interest in
                    them and of the cordial relations which have existed between the two
                    peoples.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>French propaganda is directed both towards the natives and toward the French and,
                    in accordance with the Nazi-Vichy stress on youth, special emphasis is being
                    laid on youth organizations and the value of sports for both the French and
                    native young people. Numerous youth demonstrations and sporting spectacles have
                    been staged. Summer camps are being developed, a youth code has been drawn up,
                    uniforms designed, and the responsibilities of youth stressed. The immediate
                    response to this type of propaganda is strong, particularly among the natives
                    who love spectacles, but how effective it will actually prove to be cannot yet
                    be told.</p>
                <p>Pictures, posters, quotations from, and laudatory statements regarding Marshal
                    Petain are to be found everywhere. The French Legion, composed principally of
                    small business men, clerks, mechanics, and low salaried government employees, is
                    striving ever harder to set itself up as the leader of French life and chief
                    interpreter of the Vichy code. The press and radio are extremely critical of the
                    democracies and frequently violently anti-Ally, yet they seldom are positively
                    pro-Axis.</p>
                <p>It is doubtful whether French propaganda has been very effective except in its
                    anti-British aspects, which have featured it since June 1940, and in the
                    immediate response to its youth program.</p>
                <p>10. Attitude of the French and Annamites:</p>
                <p>So far as is known the Government General never made any attempt, at least in
                    southern Indochina, to assist or communicate with American consular officers
                    after the outbreak of war, although on March 23 the Japanese Consul called
                    because, he said, the Governor General wished information regarding the welfare
                    of consular officers and the conditions of their internment.</p>
                <p>There were always two policemen, usually Annamite, stationed opposite the house
                    in which the consular officers were interned, but their object appeared to be
                    more to note those who made friendly signs to the internees or attempted to
                    communicate with them than to guard them in any way. On one occasion in
                    particular the Consulate's French clerk, Mme. Petra, came to the fence, and the
                    next day, when she was out, the French police questioned her two young daughters
                    in an effort to ascertain why she had called.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>In this connection there is now reported to be an extensive Gestapo organization
                    in Indochina particularly designed to detect those who express pro-Allied
                    sentiments. Persons have on occasion been reported by their servants, and even
                    in small private gatherings people are extremely careful in expressing opinions.
                    In the early days of the war friends of British and American citizens were
                    generally careful not to show undue friendliness or interest in their fate for
                    fear of the possible consequences and, since that time, the French authorities
                    have let it be known that it was not advisable to be seen in the vicinity of the
                    British consular residence.Nevertheless, British and American consular officers
                    never observed any signs of hostility among the many persons who passed the
                    house daily, nor on the several occasions when sporting or other events brought
                    considerable crowds before the house. A competent observer who had had an
                    opportunity to question many people since the outbreak of war has reached the
                    conclusion that the French in Indochina may be divided into four groups: (1) 20
                    percent who are totally pro-Ally, (2) 20 percent who are pro-American but
                    anti-British, (3) 20 percent who are totally indifferent as long as their own
                    immediate welfare is not in question, and (4) 40 percentwho are pro-Petain and
                    the majority of whom are wholly pro-Axis. The pro-Ally group is predominantly
                    commercial and the pro-Axis group predominantly governmental.</p>
                <p>The majority of the native population is undoubtedly indifferent to the political
                    aspects of the present struggle. Nevertheless, there is an appreciable group of
                    upper class Annamites, particularly those who had relatives working for British
                    or American interests — some of whom have been interned by the Japanese because
                    of “disloyalty” — which is strongly anti-Japanese. There is also a lower class
                    group which is anti-Japanese because the Japanese have made it difficult for
                    them to obtain their normal articles of food and because the Japanese treat
                    hired labor harshly and pay poorly.</p>

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>(1) In this connection the following data is given regarding the most vulnerable
                    points on the railway and highway between Haiphong and Saigon, proceeding from
                    Haiphong to Hanoi and south to Saigon: leaving Haiphong there is one railway
                    bridge and one small highway bridge. About 15 kilometers east of Haiphong, there
                    is an important combined railway and highway bridge. Entering Hanoi there is an
                    important railway and highway bridge which is 1.7 kilometers long. South of
                    Hanoi there is a small but important railway and highway bridge 6 kilometers
                    north of Thanh-Hoa. Immediately south of Vinh (at Benthuy) there is a large
                    railway bridge where road traffic uses a ferry. A few kilometers south of Dong
                    Hoi there is a railway bridge where road traffic again uses a ferry. Just north
                    of Quang Tri there is an important railway and highway bridge. At Hue there is a
                    railway bridge slightly west of the city and a highway bridge in it. At the Col
                    des Nuages about 65 kilometers south of Hue the railway and highway run together
                    along the cliffs, the railway under the highway in about three tunnels. At Quang
                    Ngai there is one railway and one highway bridge. At Cap Varella the railway and
                    highway run along the cliffs, the railway below the highway in the Baxbonneau
                    tunnel. This is perhaps the most vulnerable spot in the whole line, since repair
                    would probably be the most troublesome. It was the last section of the railway
                    to be built and caused the French the greatest difficulty. One and a half
                    kilometers south of Tyhoa and 128.5 kilometers north of Nha Trang a steel
                    railway bridge runs close beside a concrete highway bridge. Each has long spans
                    and both would be vulnerable to a single powerful bomb. Between Bien Hoa and
                    Saigon about 5 kilometers south of Bien Hoa are two important combined railway
                    and highway bridges about half a mile apart.</p>
                <p>On the highway between Saigon and Phnom Penh there is one concrete bridge about
                    120 meters long about 85 kilometers west of Saigon and another similar bridge
                    about five kilometers east of Phnom Penh.</p>
                <p>Other possible bombing objectives outside of Haiphong, Hanoi, and Saigon are: a
                    distillery 10 kilometers south of Hanoi on the Mandarin Road to Nam Dinh; a
                    distillery near the railway and highway bridge at Than Hoa, and the railroad
                    yards at Vinh which is more important than Saigon as a repair center.</p>
