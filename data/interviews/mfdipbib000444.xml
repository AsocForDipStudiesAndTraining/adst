                <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
                <p>Though entering the Foreign Service as a Japanese area specialist, five of my
                    assignments between 1956 and 1973 had much to do with US-China policy during
                    critical years of change. These five assignments were:</p>
                <p>(1)Regional Planning Advisor for the Far East, 1956-60;</p>
                <p>(2)American Consul General to Hong Kong, 1961-63;</p>
                <p>(3)Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the Far East, 1963-65;</p>
                <p>(4)American Ambassador to Indonesia, 1965-69; and</p>
                <p>(5)Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific, 1969-73.</p>
                <p>When I was assigned to Indonesia in June 1965, the Washington Post editorially
                    deplored the sending of an American Ambassador to Indonesia because of President
                    Sukarno's destructive policies and because “Green's departure would remove from
                    Washington the one policy man in the administration charged with taking a
                    long-range look at US relations with Communist China.” My four years in
                    Indonesia nevertheless turned out to have a lot more to do with China and China
                    policy than anyone could have foreseen. It was also in Indonesia in April 1967
                    that I first met Mr. Nixon (a New York lawyer at that time) and engaged in the
                    first of several conversations I had with him over the next several years on
                    US-China policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I am no scholar, historian or writer, and I have long vowed that I would never
                    author one of those now-it-can-be-told books. On the other hand, I recognize
                    that all of us who have participated in the formulation of American foreign
                    policy—in whatever role—are under obligation to pass on to posterity some record
                    of our involvement and insights. This is the central purpose of the recently
                    inaugurated oral history program of the Association of Diplomatic Studies; and
                    it was while reviewing transcripts of my oral history that I recognized the need
                    for reporting my China experiences in a more accurate and complete manner.</p>
                <p>Hence this manuscript which is almost entirely based on personal diaries,
                    memoranda, letters and notes, almost all of them preserved and filed by my
                    invaluable assistant and secretary over the years, Emma Johnson.</p>
                <p>I am also greatly indebted to a number of Foreign Service China language/area
                    specialists—especially Jack Service, John Lacey, Lindsey Grant and John
                    Holdridge—with whom I served at one time or another and from whom I learned
                    much. Bob Martens, a Foreign Service Soviet specialist who interviewed me for my
                    oral history, deserves special mention for his enlightening assistance. However,
                    any errors or shortcomings in this manuscript are certainly my own.</p>
                <p>It is to be hoped that this record, along with those of other Foreign Service
                    Officers involved in China policy, will be made widely available to scholars,
                    diplomats and others. Perhaps, some day, a complete record of the Foreign
                    Service's role in China policy can be assembled, from the dark days of World War
                    II and subsequent McCarthyism to the brighter days of the 1970's and 1980's
                    brought on by the rise of pragmatism in Peking and of maturity in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I</p>
                <p>WORKING WITH ROBERTSON AND DULLES;THE TAIWAN STRAIT CRISIS OF 1958</p>
                <p>My involvement in China policy dates back to 1956 when, on leaving the National
                    War College, I was assigned as Regional Planning Advisor for the Far East
                    working in the State Department's Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs. The Bureau at
                    that time was dominated by Assistant Secretary of State Walter Robertson, the
                    quintessential Virginia gentleman, a banker by profession, who had powerful
                    connections in the Administration and Congress. Robertson's overriding interest
                    in world affairs was to uphold the position of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek as
                    President of all of China, even though Chiang and his defeated Nationalist
                    forces had fled the mainland in 1949 to take refuge on Taiwan, China's
                    island-province.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Because of Robertson's sinocentrism and because I had to draft a number of his
                    speeches, I was automatically drawn into China-policy issues—especially those
                    relating to the defense of what we called Free China or the Chinese Nationalists
                    (Chinats) or, most correctly, the Republic of China (ROC), as opposed to the
                    Chinese Communists (Chicoms) or the Chinese Reds, or, most correctly, the
                    People's Republic of China—a term we rarely used in those days.</p>
                <p>For me, this was not an assignment I contemplated with unalloyed joy. I liked
                    Robertson personally. He was kindly and thoughtful towards all members of his
                    staff. He was also a strong defender of the Foreign Service at a time when many
                    Foreign Service Officers were still reeling from the effects of McCarthyism. All
                    14 of the Ambassadors in his area (East Asia and Australasia) were careerists—a
                    record never before or since achieved by any bureau in the State Department.</p>
                <p>I was also fortunate in having Ambassador J. Graham Parsons as my immediate
                    superior. He was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State at that time, and was to
                    replace Robertson in 1959. Jeff Parsons was one of the ablest officers in the
                    Foreign Service, articulate and a master of diplomatic practices, so essential
                    in our business. On the other hand, Walter Robertson's single-minded dedication
                    to upholding the position of Chiang Kai-shek as the President of all of China
                    was one I could not altogether share, and writing acceptable speeches taxed my
                    New England conscience to its limits.</p>
                <p>We also expended vast amounts of diplomatic capital on upholding the ROC's
                    position in the United Nations as the sole legal representative of all of China;
                    and our highly visible military presence on Taiwan, especially in Taipei, was
                    bound to affront the nationalistic feelings of people on Taiwan. It certainly
                    affronted the sensibilities of foreign diplomats like the Japanese Ambassador
                    who was billeted in a US military area in the center of Taipei identified on
                    large billboards as “Freedom Village.”</p>
                <p>I happened to be visiting Taipei in May 1957 as a member of a Presidential
                    Mission headed by Frank Nash, Assistant Secretary of Defense, which was looking
                    into problems related to our world-wide base presence. Just as we were being
                    reassured by the US Charg� d'Affaires in Taipei that there was no problem with
                    the public over our base presence in Taiwan, our Embassy was attacked by a mob
                    which sacked the Embassy, beat up some of our personnel hiding in the basement,
                    and scattered official US files all over the streets of Taipei. This mob action
                    was touched off by the shooting of a Taiwanese peeping-tom by an American
                    sergeant, who was then acquitted by an American military court in Taipei amidst
                    the cheers of his compatriots and in the presence of the peeping-tom's weeping
                    widow and her friends.</p>
                <p>Armed with evidence like this, the Frank Nash mission came up with convincing
                    conclusions and recommendations that did much, world-wide, to help lessen
                    friction over the presence of US bases overseas.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Another China-related issue of major interest to my office at that time was
                    evidence of a growing split in Sino-Soviet relations. I twice visited the Rand
                    Corporation at Santa Monica, California, where a team of experts was analyzing
                    Peking's reactions to the launching of Sputnik in 1957. It was increasingly
                    clear to these experts (including my former State Department colleague Alice
                    Hsia) that China efforts to share in, and benefit from, Soviet technological
                    breakthroughs were being rebuffed by Moscow. Two China delegations returned to
                    Peking empty-handed. This was briefly followed by Chinese propaganda broadcasts
                    calling for a nuclear-free Far East, but it was clear that this line, probably
                    parlayed to Peking by Moscow, was in conflict with Peking's own aspirations to
                    become a nuclear power.</p>
                <p>It was not until the following year that I became directly involved in the
                    formulation of US policy toward China. This occurred during and after the Taiwan
                    Strait Crisis of 1958 when I fortuitously became Secretary of State John Foster
                    Dulles' action officer at the working level dealing with the crisis.</p>
                <p>I will undertake to describe this incident in some detail because existing
                    accounts (at least the ones I have read) are incomplete with regard to how
                    Washington policymakers grappled with the crisis.</p>
                <p>- - - - - - -</p>
                <p>For several months before the Chinese Communists (Chicoms) opened up their
                    artillery barrage against Quemoy on August 23, 1958, I had been chairing a
                    working-level interagency task force (State, Defense and CIA) which was one of
                    several established by the White House to examine US capabilities to cope with
                    two or more simultaneous military crises in various parts of the world. One of
                    the scenarios our task force had just completed related to a Chicom aerial or
                    artillery interdiction of the Quemoy island group (Big Quemoy, Little Quemoy,
                    Tatan, Ehrtan and Tungting) held by the Nationalists but located just a few
                    miles off the shore of mainland China.</p>
                <p>So when in fact an artillery interdiction was launched against the Quemoy group
                    where one-third of the Nationalist forces was stationed, I was able to submit to
                    Jeff Parsons that same day our agreed task force recommendations on US
                    countermeasures. These recommendations called for a cautious escalation of US
                    naval and air support operations as necessary to protect Taiwan from a Communist
                    take-over. Parsons and, subsequently, Robertson approved the recommendations
                    which were forwarded to Dulles. However, Robertson commented to me that the US
                    would, of course, never make first use of nuclear weapons. I found this remark
                    rather astonishing coming from one of our leading hawks.</p>
                <p>Dulles, flying down from his vacation retreat on Duck Island in the St. Laurence
                    River, immediately called a meeting in his office. He had obviously read our
                    recommendations but his first concern was legal. What were our defense
                    obligations towards the offshore islands of Quemoy and Matsu? What restrictions
                    applied to the involvement of US forces in their defense?</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>These small offshore islands were not included in the US-ROC Mutual Defense
                    Treaty's definition of the treaty area, but a subsequent joint resolution of
                    Congress in January 1955, at the time of the first Taiwan Straits crisis,
                    authorized the President to employ US armed forces in the protection of not just
                    Taiwan and the Pescadores but also “related positions and territories in that
                    area.”</p>
                <p>Dulles had no difficulty in making a legal case that the joint resolution covered
                    the offshore islands in this crisis, since Peking, in attacking them, announced
                    that its objective was Taiwan. The President and Congressional leaders agreed.
                    Establishing rules for the engagement of US forces was more difficult.</p>
                <p>The Quemoy group of islands was so close to mainland shore batteries that they
                    could be blanketed with enemy shells, although there was no evidence of any
                    impending Chicom landing operation against those islands. In fact, the shelling
                    occurred immediately before the typhoon season when amphibious operations would
                    have been most precarious. It was fairly clear that Peking did not want to take
                    the islands unless, in doing so, it brought down the government on Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Peking's evident intent was interdiction of the offshore islands: to prevent
                    provisions, including food and ammunition, from reaching the defenders, thereby
                    wearing them down to the point of surrender which in turn would precipitate a
                    collapse of morale on Taiwan and a takeover from within by the Communists.</p>
                <p>The problem therefore came down to one of resupplying the embattled Quemoy group,
                    a task that was beyond the capability of the Nationalist Navy which was not only
                    poorly led at that time but had to contend with incessant bombardment of the
                    Quemoy group by Soviet-manufactured artillery, rough seas and alleged 27 foot
                    tides which further complicated the landing of supplies on the islands. Thus it
                    was arranged that the US Navy would escort Chinese resupply convoys to a point
                    three miles offshore from Quemoy but would not enter Quemoy's territorial
                    waters. Nationalist vessels had to cover the last three miles on their own,
                    loaded with supplies including shells for Quemoy's 8” howitzers and other
                    guns.</p>
                <p>Secretary Dulles, acting under President Eisenhower's instructions, decided
                    against US air operations in the Taiwan Straits and reached agreement with
                    Taipei that US and Nationalist planes would not overfly mainland China, thereby
                    ruling out air attacks on Chicom shore batteries. One important reason for this
                    decision was that there was no way of silencing these batteries short of use of
                    nuclear weapons or extensive air-drops of napalm bombs, actions President
                    Eisenhower strongly opposed. It was also increasingly apparent that Chicom air
                    capability was being used with great restraint, there being no bombing of any
                    Nationalist-held territories.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Our limited rules of engagement reflected awareness of the lack of support in the
                    United States for getting involved in a war over distant islands that “weren't
                    worth the life of a single American boy.” Nor did we have international support
                    beyond that of the Republic of China on Taiwan, South Korea and South Vietnam.
                    Governments of key nations allied to the US like Great Britain and Japan were
                    correctly restrained in their criticisms, but public opinion in these countries
                    was highly averse to US involvement.</p>
                <p>Secretary Dulles was accordingly bent on finding some diplomatic course of action
                    to bring the fighting to a halt. He set little store by what the periodic US-PRC
                    ambassadorial-level talks in Warsaw could achieve on this issue, though he
                    appreciated that their publicized existence offered relief from criticisms that
                    the US was out of diplomatic contact with the Peking government on this and
                    other issues.</p>
                <p>Very early on the morning of September 7, 1958, I received a phone call from
                    Dulles, who had evidently had a restless night, suggesting that it might be best
                    for the US to take the issue to the United Nations, since the General Assembly
                    would be reconvening the following week. Dulles mentioned the possibility of
                    having the British and French introduce a resolution in the UNSC calling for a
                    UN-supervised cease-fire and neutralization of the offshore islands.</p>
                <p>I was strongly opposed to this suggestion which both Peking and Taipei would
                    reject out of hand, and it would impose great strains on our relations with
                    Taipei which in turn might strengthen the case for Peking occupying China's seat
                    in the UN. However, I said nothing about all this to Dulles over the phone but
                    replied that he would have our Bureau's reactions as soon as possible. I
                    forthwith prepared a memorandum, approved by Jeff Parsons and signed by
                    Robertson, pointing out the negative factors entailed in Dulles' suggestion and
                    alternatively recommending that we ask the British and French to introduce a UN
                    resolution welcoming Washington's and Peking's discussions of this issue at
                    Warsaw and urging that the issue be resolved between Peking and Taipei without
                    further resort to force. Also included in Robertson's memorandum was a
                    suggestion that our side might at some point in the near future take unilateral
                    and unannounced moves such as shifting our regular Taiwan Straits patrols
                    further away from Chicom territorial waters, and the Nationalists suspending
                    artillery fire from Quemoy, to see whether this invited any reciprocal moves
                    from the Communist side.</p>
                <p>However, before any of these strategies could be pursued, our attention focused
                    on the immediate, urgent issue of Quemoy running out of supplies. The daily
                    consumption of supplies by the 80,000 military and 45,000 civilians on the
                    Quemoy group was estimated at 700 tons and yet, since August 23, only 125 tons
                    had been delivered to Quemoy. This appalling record was ascribed to all the
                    usual reasons—bad weather, tidal conditions, heavy shelling—but it also occurred
                    to some in Washington that Taipei was deliberately holding back, or providing us
                    with false figures, in an effort to get the US more involved in the islands'
                    defenses.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Our Joint Chiefs of Staff could see no reason why, with the exercise of guts and
                    ingenuity, the Nationalists, under existing rules of engagement, could not
                    off-load up to 1,000 tons of supplies a day under favorable weather conditions.
                    Admiral Arleigh Burke recommended new ways of delivering supplies, including
                    floating them ashore.</p>
                <p>Over the next two weeks there was some improvement in deliveries but not enough
                    to prevent, according to Taipei's reports, an alarming run-down in the
                    availability of food and ammunition on the Quemoys. By September 28, Taipei
                    reported that only a few days of supplies remained. Cables from the American
                    Embassy in Taipei were full of dire warnings.</p>
                <p>It was at this point that Secretary Dulles decided to go to New York to take the
                    issue to the UN along the lines he had suggested over the phone on September 7.
                    However, the very day he left for New York, I received word from a colleague in
                    CIA that a reliable report had just been received from Quemoy stating that its
                    supply situation was nowhere near as desperate as we had been led to believe.
                    There were several weeks of supplies on hand, most of them stored in the
                    extensive network of tunnels on Quemoy.</p>
                <p>Robertson asked that I deliver this information in person to Acting Secretary of
                    State Christian Herter who immediately called a meeting in his office. There it
                    was decided that I should go to New York to bring these developments to Dulles'
                    attention, with a recommendation from Herter that Dulles might wish to postpone
                    any UN initiative.</p>
                <p>I was met in New York by Ambassador Philip Crowe of USUN who took me to Dulles'
                    suite in the Waldorf. When Dulles heard our reports, he canceled scheduled
                    meetings with the British and French Ambassadors to the UN, returned to
                    Washington, and called a meeting that evening at his house. The star performer
                    at that meeting was Admiral Burke who was very up-beat on prospects for
                    resupplying the Quemoys, mentioning for the first time in my hearing the fact
                    that two of the Navy's LSDs (Landing Ship Docks) were about to arrive on station
                    in the Taiwan Straits. These huge landing ship docks could contain dozens of
                    amphibious landing craft, manned by trained Nationalist crews, which would run
                    up on the shores of Quemoy with supplies.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile spirits on Taiwan had been lifted by the deadly effectiveness of
                    several Nationalist fighter aircraft on patrol, whose US-provided Sidewinders
                    downed five MiG 17s.</p>
                <p>It was against this background that Peking radio announced on October 6 that it
                    was temporarily suspending its bombardment of the offshores, emphasizing that
                    its action was taken to spare the lives of Chinese compatriots inhabiting those
                    islands. Our side immediately reciprocated by suspending US convoy activities
                    and modifying our naval patrol routes in the Taiwan Straits.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The outlook remained unclear, and when Dulles departed on October 20 for Taipei,
                    via Italy and England, Peking announced the end of its cease-fire on the alleged
                    grounds that one of our LSDs had intruded into the territorial waters of Quemoy.
                    [Dulles included Italy on his itinerary to attend De Gasperi's funeral. His
                    brief stop-over in England prompted a black-bordered box on the front page of
                    the London Times headlined “England's Darkest Hour” and reading as follows:
                    “Asked today why he had come to England, Secretary Dulles replied that his plane
                    came here to refuel.”</p>
                <p>On October 25, following the issuance of a joint US-ROC communiqu� at the
                    conclusion of Dulles' visit to Taipei, Peking announced its intention to observe
                    a cease-fire on the offshore islands on odd-numbered days. Taipei retaliated by
                    firing on occasional Chicom vessels from batteries on Quemoy.</p>
                <p>This curious arrangement left each of the Chinese governments with the
                    satisfaction that it was master of the situation, but we had no idea of how long
                    this arrangement would continue. Thus, when Dulles returned from Taipei, his
                    first concern was to preserve the relative calm while doing everything he could
                    to get the bulk of Chiang's forces off the offshore islands. On the other hand,
                    we felt we had to be careful in handling this effort, lest sharp open
                    differences between Washington and Taipei tempt Peking to renew the
                    bombardment.</p>
                <p>I well recall Secretary Dulles' comments on his return to Washington: “If nothing
                    is done now and then a year-or-so hence the Chicoms again attack the offshores,
                    it will be extremely difficult for us to give the ROC any military support.
                    Already we have had to strain our relations with Congress and foreign
                    governments to the breaking point. Our experience with the offshores was
                    agonizing enough in 1955. It is worse today. We can't go through this a third
                    time.”</p>
                <p>Our efforts to effect a drastic reduction in the garrisons on the offshore
                    islands never succeeded. There was an eventual sizeable reduction, but meanwhile
                    we came to appreciate that the Chinese in their own peculiar way had found a
                    solution of turning their hot war into an endless propaganda battle—of
                    propaganda shells, blaring loud speakers, and balloon-delivered leaflets. Peking
                    also issued a long series of “serious warnings” to the US every time one of our
                    naval patrols in the Taiwan Straits came within Chinese mainland territorial
                    waters as defined by Peking, but not by Washington. The serious warnings had
                    nearly reached the thousand mark by the time President Nixon's trip to China was
                    announced in 1971. Thereafter the warnings ceased.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>In retrospect, I have often wondered whether Moscow had any hand in Peking's
                    decision to halt the heavy bombardment of Quemoy. We know that almost all the
                    580,000 shells fired on the islands were produced in the Soviet Union, and that
                    the first signs of serious Moscow-Peking differences appeared soon after the
                    Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957, about a year before the 1958 Taiwan Straits
                    crisis. It is possible that Moscow imposed conditions on its support of Peking's
                    offense. However, we assumed during that crisis that Peking had Moscow's
                    unqualified support. Moscow said little to suggest otherwise. In fact,
                    Khrushchev warned on several occasions that any use of nuclear weapons would not
                    go unanswered by the USSR. (Peking exploded its first nuclear weapon in
                    1964.)</p>
                <p>- - - - - - -</p>
                <p>Finally, a few comments about Secretary Dulles' handling of the crisis. I was
                    deeply impressed by his excellent working relations with President Eisenhower,
                    as well as with his associates in State, Defense, and CIA (headed by his
                    brother, Allen). On several occasions, near the conclusion of meetings in his
                    office, Dulles would pick up the secure phone and tell the President of our
                    conclusions and solicit his comments or, where relevant, his approval. Dulles
                    thus made it clear to all present that he was acting under Eisenhower's orders.
                    That, in turn, strengthened Dulles' position with all his associates.</p>
                <p>I was also impressed by the way Dulles took charge of the problem, making it his
                    personal responsibility to work out a peaceful solution, losing many hours of
                    sleep in the process. Yet he sought advice from his associates. I recall how
                    Gerard Smith, at that time Director of the State Department's Policy Planning
                    Staff, used to argue almost instinctively against the emerging consensus of
                    several of our meetings. Dulles seemed to welcome the ensuing debate which
                    helped to fine-hone the final decisions.</p>
                <p>Diplomatic biographer Sir Harold Nicholson once wrote that the worst kind of
                    diplomatists are zealots, lawyers and missionaries; and the best kind are humane
                    skeptics.</p>
                <p>In his first years as Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles seemed to fall
                    clearly in the first category. He was a dyed-in-the-wool lawyer with a cold-war
                    missionary zeal. For him, countering Soviet aggressive acts gave rise to a new
                    term in diplomacy: “brinksmanship.” He stonily refused to shake the extended
                    hand of Zhou En-lai at Geneva in 1954—an insult never forgotten by Zhou. He was
                    also associated in the minds of many of us Foreign Service Officers with Senator
                    McCarthy and his ilk who pilloried the Foreign Service and hounded out of office
                    several of our best China specialists whose only “crime” was the accuracy of
                    their reports out of China during World War II, predicting the decline of the
                    Chinese Nationalists under Generalissimo Chiang and the rise of Mao's
                    Communists.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>John Foster Dulles may be remembered by history as one of our most zealous,
                    hard-line Secretaries of State, especially in his dealings with Moscow and
                    Peking, but from my vantage point, in the next to last year of his life, he
                    appeared as a man of moderation and reason, an able practitioner of diplomacy as
                    well as of law.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER II</p>
                <p>HONG KONG 1961-63NEED FOR A NEW LOOK AT OUR CHINA POLICY</p>
                <p>After two stormy years in Korea, I arrived in the relative political calm of Hong
                    Kong where the US Consulate General served as our government's eyes and ears
                    covering events inside the vastness of China. The steady stream of refugees from
                    mainland China provided a wealth of information about economic conditions in
                    China—information made available to us through Hong Kong government and private
                    sources—as well as receiving an assortment of sometimes useful information
                    contained in the masses of periodicals, newspapers and letters that reached Hong
                    Kong from all parts of China. We had on our staff 21 people whose sole function
                    was to translate and analyze these written materials.</p>
                <p>For me, being head of a large staff comprising some of our most experienced
                    Foreign Service Officers in Chinese affairs, provided a unique opportunity to
                    listen and to learn. I well remember my first lesson, shortly after my arrival
                    in November 1961, when India seized the Portuguese enclave of Goa. I was alarmed
                    that China would now feel impelled to seize the Portuguese enclave of Macao,
                    some 30 miles from Hong Kong. Since I was also US Consul to Macao, my
                    responsibilities to the several dozen Americans there would seem to involve
                    ordering and assisting in their immediate evacuation. But the head of our
                    Political Section at that time, Dr. Harald Jacobson, recommended otherwise. In
                    fact, he was completely confident, as was Jack Friedman, our Macao expert, that
                    Peking would not take Macao, for such a seizure would precipitate a collapse of
                    business confidence in Hong Kong and a resulting loss of almost a billion
                    dollars a year which Peking was making at that time (today it is many times
                    that) through its business ties with Hong Kong. In other words, Peking was not
                    about to kill the goose that laid the billion dollar golden egg and which was
                    China's principal source of foreign exchange. So, abiding by Jacobson's
                    recommendation, I wired Washington our conclusions in order to head off likely
                    pressures from the State Department for evacuating all Americans in Macao.</p>
                <p>The early 1960's was a period of deepening turmoil and economic disaster in
                    China, due in part to Mao's ill-conceived Great Leap Forward—a desperate effort
                    to achieve rapid modernization through forced-draft industrialization, including
                    a program for building thousands of small furnaces designed to produce steel.
                    Agriculture was badly neglected in the process, resources squandered, and the
                    whole effort collapsed leaving ruin in its wake.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Analysts in our Consulate General estimated that China's grain production
                    (including potatoes) in 1961 was 160 million tons which was some 30 million tons
                    short of levels required to provide China's teeming population with an adequate
                    diet. Our analysis, based on a variety of sources (especially comprehensive
                    weather reports and interrogations of thousands of refugees about their daily
                    food consumption) was challenged by Joe Alsop in his syndicated columns as being
                    too high, but we were vindicated a year later when Zhou En-lai told Lord
                    Montgomery that grain production in China in 1961 was 160 million tons.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Hong Kong thinking of China as a powerful threat to its
                    neighbors—purposeful and single-minded in its expansionist design. But I soon
                    learned that the Communist regime was floundering, and that its attempts to
                    disperse “surplus” urban dwellers to the farms had deepened discontent among
                    urban and rural dwellers alike. The touted public discipline of China was
                    decaying, as evidenced by signs of growing corruption, bureaucratic
                    indifference, and general laxity that permeated even the youth and armed forces.
                    Of course the capacity of the Chinese people to endure privations was legendary,
                    and China's ability to exploit troubles along its borders unchanged, but it was
                    clearly not the fearsome dragon conjured up in the minds of many Americans.</p>
                <p>More importantly, China no longer had an ally in Russia. The Sino-Soviet rift
                    that made its first appearance after the Sputnik launching in 1957 had, by early
                    1962, reached the stage where it was beyond the ability of our Consulate General
                    translators to find expressions in English equal to Peking's scatological
                    denunciations of the Kremlin.</p>
                <p>Many of us in the Consulate General felt that we overly advertised our concern
                    and worry over China's aggressive power—and that this invited bluster, threat
                    and intervention from the Communist side. Psychologically we would be in a
                    stronger competitive position if we appeared to be less harried and worried over
                    Peking's threat. We would also stand to gain greater international support for
                    our position if our views were expressed in more objective, factual and
                    unemotional terms.</p>
                <p>At the same time, we fully supported continuation of a US policy of firmness in
                    the defense of “free world” positions and maintaining adequate capabilities for
                    pursuing that policy successfully. We did, however, weigh in strongly against
                    unnecessary provocations of Communist China, such as the occasional sabotage
                    operations being conducted by the Chinese Nationalists from Taiwan against
                    targets on the China mainland. These operations were not only fruitless, but
                    they damaged the Republic of China's international standing. Moreover, such
                    operations, to the extent they involved Hong Kong, could endanger Hong Kong and
                    were deeply resented by the Hong Kong government.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>A golden opportunity to present these views to key figures in the new Kennedy
                    Administration occurred in the Spring of 1962 at a meeting of all our East
                    Asia/Australasia Chiefs of Missions at Baguio in the Philippines. This meeting
                    was presided over by Under Secretary of State Chester Bowles and Assistant
                    Secretary Averell Harriman, both of whom reacted favorably to my presentation of
                    how we in the Consulate General evaluated the scene in China and its
                    implications for US policy. This established a useful meeting of minds between
                    our Consulate General and policymakers in Washington.</p>
                <p>One of the effects of economic set-backs in China was the way it stepped up the
                    flow of refugees to Hong Kong. This problem continues today, but at no time did
                    it reach the levels of mid-1962. A principal reason for the great surge of
                    refugees into Hong Kong from the adjoining province of Guangdong in 1962 was a
                    severe drought in South China coinciding with a temporary breakdown in the
                    ability (or willingness) of PRC officials in Guangdong to restrain the flow of
                    refugees—many of them young people who had been forced out of the cities to live
                    in rural areas. It appeared for a while that the Chinese authorities had decided
                    to allow them to flee to Hong Kong, if only to ease pressures on food supplies
                    and to lessen problems for China created by these disgruntled elements.</p>
                <p>The numbers of refugees got so large that the Hong Kong government constructed
                    massive barriers of concertina wire all along its land frontier with China. But
                    every night the refugees merely threw planks across the wire and swarmed in,
                    only to be rounded up by the Hong Kong garrisons and forced back into China
                    (although many eluded the Hong Kong police and managed to get into the city of
                    Hong Kong).</p>
                <p>At first, the Hong Kong Government forbore from making any representations to
                    Peking on this appalling situation, evidently fearing that Peking would reject
                    Hong Kong's protests, and Hong Kong would then have to live with the results.
                    Besides Hong Kong had only the status of a colony, and had to deal with Peking
                    through London. Meanwhile, I was receiving expressions of concern from the State
                    Department which was torn between wanting Hong Kong to accept refugees as a
                    matter of principle, and a sober awareness of how such huge numbers of refugees
                    could turn Hong Kong into another Gaza Strip. [Curiously, U.S. media gave this
                    dramatic human interest story almost no coverage. This included the New York
                    Times whose managing editor, Turner Catledge, visited Hong Kong just as the
                    refugee crisis ended. When I told him what had happened, he turned to his Hong
                    Kong correspondent to ask why this wasn't reported. The correspondent answered
                    that evidently the New York Times editors did not consider the story newsworthy
                    because he had filed daily reports to New York.]</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Washington was quietly urging London to take the issue up with Peking, but Hong
                    Kong recommended otherwise to London. As I learned from Murray Maclehose, at
                    that time political adviser to Hong Kong's Governor Black (later Maclehose
                    became one of Hong Kong's most effective governors), Hong Kong had reason to
                    believe that Peking would soon, on its own initiative, restore controls along
                    the Hong Kong frontier because of the bad press China was receiving world-wide,
                    with millions of Chinese seeking to escape China. Governor Black's policy proved
                    successful, but not before 170,000 Chinese refugees had succeeded in sneaking
                    permanently into over-crowded Hong Kong in the period of one month.</p>
                <p>It was instructive to observe the interrelationships between authorities in Hong
                    Kong, Peking and Canton (with whom Hong Kong transacted most of its business
                    with China). Many practical issues had to be addressed on a day-to-day basis
                    between Hong Kong and Canton relating to trade, transportation, migration, water
                    supply and finances. All these issues were handled by Hong Kong officials with
                    low-key common sense in a way best designed to avoid affronting its giant
                    neighbor. There was recognition on both sides of the compelling material
                    advantages in peaceful co-existence, even though Hong Kong's spectacular
                    economic success story on the very doorstep of backward China was, in itself, an
                    affront and provocation. Hong Kong was at pains to pay for the water piped in
                    from China (about 20 to 25 percent of Hong Kong's requirements), even though
                    China offered to provide this water free of charge. Hong Kong wanted to ensure
                    that China had a material stake in continuing the water supply in order to
                    minimize chances that China might cut it off at some point in order to impose
                    pressures on Hong Kong for whatever reason. To me, this was convincing evidence
                    that constructive relations with revolutionary Communist China were possible for
                    the United States provided Peking came to see compelling material (especially
                    strategic) reasons for such relations.</p>
                <p>Not only were we mighty busy those days with refugees, consular work, textile
                    negotiations, and countless visitors, but I had to meet, wine and dine the many
                    Congressional delegations who were attracted to Hong Kong. We also put on some
                    good briefings for VIPs on developments in China, including our policy
                    conclusions. We found that almost all the Congressional visitors shared our
                    views on U.S. policy implications. [One of these visitors, Congressman John
                    Rooney, who was Chairman of the House Subcommittee handling State's finances,
                    indicated to the State Department that he would welcome my appointment as
                    Assistant Secretary of State for Administration. I was called back to Washington
                    where I resisted pressure from the top brass of the Department to take the job.
                    I resisted because I had no qualifications for it other than Rooney's blessing.
                    I returned to Hong Kong, rather apprehensive as to my future career.]</p>
                <p>During my 21 months in Hong Kong, I had lengthy discussions with my deputy, John
                    Lacey, who was not only an excellent administrator and negotiator on U.S.-Hong
                    Kong textile issues, but whose views on China policy were practical and
                    forward-looking. We drafted a message to Washington in February 1963, in which
                    we posed the question whether we were missing any opportunities to abet forces
                    in China that might be seeking pragmatic changes.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>We then recommended seven specific ways for enhancing our capacity to influence
                    attitudes in China in a desirable direction, though admitting that even their
                    combined effect might be very slight in the immediate future.</p>
                <p>The final two paragraphs of our airgram came close to being prophetic.</p>
                <p>“Distasteful as it has been for Mao and his cohorts, they have already been
                    obliged to make some concessions basically in conflict with their ideologies.
                    When the hard-line doctrinaires no longer dominate the scene, the influence of
                    pragmatism may well intensify. Our present containment policy should be aimed at
                    abetting that process.</p>
                <p>“All this argues for a policy of continued constraint which allows and encourages
                    change with mainland China...” We also urged a review of American regulations
                    relating to Americans wishing to travel to mainland China and to do business
                    with China.</p>
                <p>Many of us in the Consulate General were struck by the folly of American policy
                    preventing our newsmen and scholars from visiting China—not that they would
                    likely be admitted, but a relaxed U.S. policy would make it clear that it was
                    China's fault, not ours, that China was closed to much of the outside world.</p>
                <p>We also were critical of the U.S. foreign assets control regulations which we had
                    to administer in Hong Kong. These regulations made it illegal for any American
                    individual or corporation to buy, even in Hong Kong, any article originating in
                    mainland China.</p>
                <p>On one occasion I had to phone the Texas owners of the new Hong Kong Hilton to
                    point out that they already had on the walls of their new hotel (which was about
                    to open) Chinese mainland artifacts which would have to be removed under U.S.
                    law. It was to the credit of the Texas owners that they uncomplainingly agreed,
                    even though, in disposing of the artifacts, they took a considerable financial
                    loss.</p>
                <p>As mentioned earlier, there were officials in the State Department who shared
                    these views, and it was a pleasant, but not an altogether unanticipated,
                    surprise when I was called back to Washington in August 1963 to be named Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary of State for the Far East, charged with taking a new look at
                    US policy toward China.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER III</p>
                <p>EFFORTS IN WASHINGTON (1963-65)TO MODIFY US POLICY TOWARDS CHINA</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>On returning to Washington in September 1963, I was named principal deputy to
                    Roger Hilsman, Assistant Secretary of State for the Far East, who had an
                    extensive background in research and intelligence and was a personal friend of
                    President Kennedy. Hilsman wanted me to devote most of my initial time to a
                    China policy review, naming as my principal assistant, Lindsey Grant, a
                    brilliant young China specialist. We also received generous help from Jim
                    Thompson (on detail from Harvard) and Joe Neubert, Hilsman's assistant. We held
                    periodic meetings with leading American scholars knowledgeable about East Asia,
                    a practice our Bureau was to continue for many years.</p>
                <p>Our first move was to reorganize State's Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs in order
                    to give greater attention to Communist Asia. At that time we had only two
                    officers (out of the hundred or more in our Bureau) who were devoting their full
                    time to Communist China and none of our officers were giving much time and
                    attention to North Korea, North Vietnam and Mongolia, even though Communist Asia
                    comprised two-thirds of the land area and population of East Asia. We
                    accordingly established a new office called ACA (Asian Communist Affairs) whose
                    four officers were responsible for mainland China, North Korea, North Vietnam
                    and Mongolia. We also managed to have two able Foreign Service officers sent to
                    Moscow for several years of instruction in Mongolian, but our recommendation for
                    establishing US relations with Mongolia, accepted in principle by key officials
                    like Governor Harriman, encountered years of delay in implementation.</p>
                <p>US diplomatic contacts with the Chinese Communists at that time were confined to
                    the ambassadorial level talks at Warsaw which had been going on intermittently
                    ever since they started at Vienna in 1954. These talks achieved only limited
                    results but they ultimately succeeded in bringing about the release of all but
                    two of the Americans held in mainland China. They further provided a forum for
                    clarifying our position on certain issues, especially a peaceful resolution of
                    the Taiwan problem. Above all, they enabled the US government to say quite
                    truthfully that we had, in Warsaw, more opportunities to meet with Peking
                    officials than had most governments which recognized the Peking government.</p>
                <p>Maoist doctrine sharply circumscribed what new courses of action were open to us,
                    and our ability to influence events inside China were almost nil. But, over the
                    longer range, opening China's contacts with the outside world could have more of
                    a salutary impact than a negative one; and it seemed important that we at least
                    demonstrate to the world that Communist China's isolation from the world was
                    self-imposed and not the result of US policies to contain Chinese Communism.
                    This was not easy to do. The United States had taken the lead year after year in
                    trying to keep Peking out of the United Nations. We had also taken the lead in
                    establishing COCOM controls designed to prevent any strategic materials from
                    reaching Communist China from the Free World. Carrying out these policies
                    involved constant pressures on friends and allies, contributing to a rather
                    widespread impression that it was US policy to cut off Chinese contacts with the
                    outside world.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>This, in fact, was not our policy. In 1959, the US, at long last, allowed 25
                    selected newsmen to have restrictions removed from their passports to permit
                    them to visit mainland China. For months they sat it out in Hong Kong seeking
                    Chinese visas. None were granted. In 1962, we announced that we would give
                    favorable attention to any bona fide Chinese request for purchase of US wheat or
                    other grains. Peking never responded.</p>
                <p>The first substantive policy recommendation which Grant and I made to Hilsman on
                    October 10, 1963 was that our government should seek to lift all US travel
                    restrictions. This would be a world-wide change in travel policy, and would not
                    be presented as an initiative to “liberalize” US policy towards Communist China
                    (or other Communist countries) for this would be immediately interpreted as a
                    softening of the US position. Nor did we proclaim that our efforts to broaden
                    contacts with mainland China were based on the assumption that they would
                    probably be rejected. We did these things because of their intrinsic merit—to
                    break down barriers between nations and peoples, to broaden knowledge and
                    understanding. Privately, we could explain that our changes in travel policy
                    were designed to show our strength and confidence at a time when China was
                    fearful of outside contacts because of the ferment brewing behind the
                    curtain.</p>
                <p>Recommendations for liberalizing rules governing travel of Americans was not a
                    new idea. The Legal Adviser's Office (L) and the Bureau of Security and Consular
                    Affairs (SCA) had already favored the idea when it was first advanced in a more
                    modified form by Hilsman in June, 1963. However, Governor Harriman (Under
                    Secretary of State) believed that a formal modification of existing regulations
                    would stir up too much adverse attention. He recommended that the State
                    Department quietly adopt a more permissive policy governing exceptions to the
                    current travel ban, and that is where the matter stood when Lindsey Grant and I
                    became involved.</p>
                <p>When we met with representatives of the Legal Advisor's Office (L) and of the
                    Bureau of Consular and Security Affairs (SCA) on November 4, it was concluded
                    that any attempt to issue passports without travel restrictions to only those
                    applicants approved by the State Department would raise constitutional
                    questions. The Legal Advisor also felt that any changes in existing practice
                    would require consultation with appropriate committees of Congress.</p>
                <p>Abba Schwartz (SCA) and I agreed with L's reservations. We also felt that a great
                    deal of the advantages we sought would be lost through a surreptitious
                    approach.</p>
                <p>Early in December, 1963, the matter was brought by Mr. Chayes (Legal Advisor) to
                    the attention of George Ball, Acting Secretary of State. Mr. Ball
                    enthusiastically supported a proposal for a total removal of travel restrictions
                    and obtained telegraphically the approval of Secretary of State Rusk. The issue
                    was now up to the White House.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I recall attending a meeting later in December attended by top State Department
                    representatives and by Attorney General Robert Kennedy. At that meeting
                    Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Edwin M. Martin,
                    convinced the Attorney General and the Secretary of State that an exception
                    would have to be made in the case of Cuba because of an existing agreement among
                    members of the Association of American States banning travel to Cuba. This
                    effectively ended our efforts to change travel policy, because the
                    administration did not want to change travel policy unless it could be done on a
                    world-wide basis. Moreover the death of President Kennedy had an overall
                    dampening effect on any proposals for policy change.</p>
                <p>All we could do at that stage was to press for liberalizing exceptions. In that
                    regard we succeeded in having US passports validated for travel to mainland
                    China for three categories: representatives of accredited news gathering
                    organizations; family members of Americans in prison in China; and, in 1965, US
                    doctors and public health experts.</p>
                <p>Our Bureau was similarly frustrated in its efforts to ease restrictions on US
                    trade with China, starting with putting medicines and foodstuffs on general
                    license. We did not think China would make any US purchases in the light of its
                    “buy anything but American” policy, but it would create a useful precedent if at
                    some future date the Chinese would wish to move away from their present frozen
                    hostility.</p>
                <p>In one important respect we succeeded. That was in recommending that our public
                    treatment of Communist China be more moderate, civil, and factual. This was
                    reflected in a key speech made by Roger Hilsman at San Francisco on December 13.
                    At first Secretary Rusk was annoyed over Hilsman's failure to get top-level
                    clearance, but public and press reactions to the Hilsman speech were so
                    overwhelmingly favorable that the Secretary reflected the same points of view in
                    a speech he made on February 25, 1964. Meanwhile, we sent guidance to our
                    Embassies on the importance of making it clear that it was the Chinese
                    Communists, not the US, who were bellicose and unwilling to accept a world of
                    diversity, as well as the importance of US officials speaking more coolly,
                    factually and civilly about Communist China in order to gain maximum
                    credibility.</p>
                <p>In retrospect there is little question but that our efforts in 1963 to liberalize
                    US policy toward mainland China failed due to major events on the other side of
                    the Pacific.</p>
                <p>Even if President Kennedy had served out his full term in office, it is unlikely
                    that any major revisions in existing China policy would have occurred during
                    that term. It is true that his thinking about China paralleled that of his
                    associates like Harriman, Bowles, Ball and Hilsman. On the other hand, he was
                    being drawn more and more into the vortex of Vietnam, and Vietnam was to claim
                    the full attention of President Johnson. With Peking evidently giving strong
                    support to Hanoi, it seemed all the more unlikely that any US Administration
                    would or could make substantive changes in China policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>More importantly, in 1964 Mao Zedong and his entourage of ideologues were intent
                    on revising the across-the-board liberalization of the early 1960's. The
                    Socialist Education Campaign—a precursor of the Cultural Revolution which was
                    launched in late 1965—sought to carry out class education of youth, eliminate
                    bourgeois influence, and stamp out “the spontaneous tendency to capitalism.”
                    This coincided with China's successful nuclear weapons test in 1964. The
                    opportunities we saw in 1962 and 1963 for improving long-term US-Chinese
                    relations were now fast disappearing. US-China relations were about to enter the
                    deep freeze of the Cultural Revolution which lasted until the early 1970's.</p>
                <p>In a well-publicized speech I made at Princeton University in May 1965, I said:
                    “Peiping's policy toward the US is very simple. It is one of avowed hostility.
                    It does not allow even for the working out of lesser problems in our
                    relations... As a Chinese Communist document puts it, 'we do not wish to settle
                    our disputes with the United States on a piecemeal basis; else we will undermine
                    the revolutionary fervor of our own people. When the time comes for a
                    settlement, it will be done all at once.'”</p>
                <p>I did not realize at the time how prophetic that underlined statement proved to
                    be: China, in 1971-72, decided it was time for a settlement with the US “all at
                    once” in the form of the Shanghai Communiqu� of February 1972.</p>
                <p>A further obstacle to US-China relations in the period 1964-65 was the war in
                    Vietnam. As I wrote in May 1965 in a memorandum to Bill Bundy who had succeeded
                    Hilsman as Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs: “The Chinese
                    Communists see the US as caught on the flypaper of South Vietnam, and they do
                    not want to see us wriggle off through negotiations and settlement.” On the
                    other hand, Peiping was concerned that the Soviets were moving into Southeast
                    Asia in a way designed to rob Peiping of the fruits of victory. What we didn't
                    appreciate in Washington was the growing tension between Hanoi and Peking.</p>
                <p>As usual, our Consulate General in Hong Kong had the clearest view of trends in
                    Communist Asia. On returning in late 1964 from a meeting with Consul General Ed
                    Rice and his Hong Kong staff, I reported their view that Hanoi was definitely
                    opposed to any large presence of Chinese Communists in North Vietnam—”in fact a
                    threat of their coming in might be a major inducement for Hanoi to come to terms
                    with us.” The Consulate General also believed that “our bombings of the north
                    are making the North Vietnamese even more tough and resistant, and the only
                    merit of the bombings is temporarily to bolster morale in the south.” The
                    Consulate General foresaw little likelihood of any real settlement of the war
                    being reached at the Conference Table, given the positions of Hanoi and
                    Peking.</p>
                <p>The following month (June 1965) I was named US Ambassador to Indonesia, an
                    assignment that unexpectedly was to involve me, once again, in US China
                    policy.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER IV</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>THE ABORTED COMMUNIST COUPIN INDONESIA—THE CHINA CONNECTION</p>
                <p>At the time of my appointment to Indonesia in June 1965, the US was deeply
                    preoccupied with Vietnam. Washington never did focus on Indonesia as a potential
                    Communist country, even though it was headed in that direction.</p>
                <p>It is true that President Sukarno's words infuriated Washington as did
                    Indonesia's armed confrontation with Malaysia, the attacks on foreign missions
                    in Jakarta, plans for expropriating foreign companies including Caltex and
                    Goodyear, Sukarno's raging at my predecessor Howard Jones “to Hell with your
                    aid,” Indonesia's walking out of the United Nations and its agencies, and its
                    increasing alignment with China and other forces hostile to the United States.
                    But these were considered by many in Washington to be the antics of a
                    vainglorious man—a dangerous man, to be sure, but not a very serious man, rather
                    one who sought the world spotlight.</p>
                <p>The Chinese Communists took Sukarno far more seriously than we did. They
                    recognized Indonesia to be a significant potential Communist state and ally. By
                    1965, the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) had become the largest and most
                    influential political force in Indonesia, as well as being by far the largest
                    Communist party outside the Sino-Soviet blocs. The PKI favored Sukarno, and he
                    them. On one occasion when Sukarno was referring to PKI leader Aidit, he shouted
                    before the crowds at Senayen arena: “I wish I had a thousand Aidits.” Sukarno's
                    drift toward Communism also related to Indonesia's imminent economic collapse
                    due to inept policies, extravagance and mismanagement.</p>
                <p>Even though Sukarno's avowed goal was to establish a NASAKOM government (acronym
                    for Nationalism, Religion, and Communism), Washington continued to see Indonesia
                    as a fractious element, not as a potential hostile force in the constellation of
                    world power.</p>
                <p>By late 1964, Sino-Indonesian relations were converging both at the PKI-CCP level
                    and at the governmental level. At the party level, the PKI had sided completely
                    with the CCP in the latter's view that revolutionary prospects were highly
                    favorable in the former colonial world (especially Southeast Asia) and that the
                    leadership of the world revolutionary movement was passing from Soviet to Asian
                    hands. Differences with the Soviets were also reflected in positions taken by
                    Sukarno's government, even though it continued to receive considerable Soviet
                    aid, especially military hardware.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>At the governmental level, Sukarno announced to the million or more people
                    crowding Merdeka Square on August 17, 1965, (Indonesia's national day), the
                    formation of the Peking-Jakarta-Pyongyang-Hanoi axis. This announcement was made
                    in the presence of top officials of Communist Asia, including Chinese Foreign
                    Minister Chen Yi. I realized in advance of this occasion that it would be used
                    by Sukarno to blast the United States in a way that normal diplomatic practice
                    would require my walking out of the pavilion where all the diplomatic corps was
                    seated. But I had already decided, with Washington's telegraphic approval, not
                    to give Sukarno that satisfaction, so I stoically sat it out, with press cameras
                    trained on me.</p>
                <p>During Indonesia's confrontation with Malaysia and the U.K., Peking was urging
                    Sukarno to accelerate the radicalization of his policies, especially to use the
                    confrontation as a means of establishing and arming a “Fifth Force,” largely
                    composed of Communist organizations, to be a counteragent to the Indonesian
                    Army. All these developments polarized differences between the Indonesian Army
                    on the one hand, and the Communists (PKI), supported by Sukarno, on the other.
                    Sukarno became seriously ill in late August 1965 which immediately raised fears
                    among the Communists (and probably the Air Force which was led by leftists)
                    that, should Sukarno die, the Army would move in and crush the Communists. It
                    was in that setting that the PKI planned a coup against the Army, almost
                    certainly with the knowledge of the Chinese Communists and possibly with their
                    approval.</p>
                <p>On the night of September 30-October 1, 1965, the PKI hunted down and killed six
                    of Indonesia's eight top army generals and seized control of Jakarta, announcing
                    over the radio that the “September 30 movement” had taken control of the
                    government in order to forestall a CIA-supported plot by the Generals to oust
                    Sukarno and establish a military government. (There was no CIA or other US
                    foreknowledge of the Communist coup or of any General's plot to oust Sukarno.
                    Army generals deplored Sukarno's Communist leanings but they would not challenge
                    him or refuse to take orders.)</p>
                <p>However the Indonesian army moved quickly against the Communist coup and
                    suppressed it within a day or two. This left Sukarno weakened and suspect, and
                    he eventually was replaced by Suharto, one of the two ranking surviving
                    generals. Meanwhile the PKI was shattered and tens of thousands of suspected
                    Communists, including a disproportionately high number of Chinese ethnics, were
                    assassinated by anti-Communist forces mostly in the rural areas of Java and
                    Bali. Here it should be pointed out that the Indonesians had a racial bias
                    against the 3 million Chinese living in Indonesia. The Chinese were mainly
                    resented because of their control of money-lending and retail trades.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>The aborted coup was a devastating set-back for Communist China whose role in the
                    coup was highly suspect. Twelve separate Indonesian delegations were in China at
                    the time of the coup, including delegations headed by the Deputy Prime Minister,
                    the Head of the Air Force, and the Head of the National Defense Institute. There
                    was also a large PKI delegation which, unlike previous PKI delegations sent to
                    China, did not include any of its top level officers who evidently remained in
                    Indonesia because of the critical events about to unfold.</p>
                <p>Most significant of all was the evidence, subsequently received, that the Chinese
                    knew what to expect. According to Robert Martens, our Embassy's expert on
                    Sino-Soviet affairs who has spent many months researching the events of
                    September 30-October 1, 1965, the Chinese leadership at that critical moment,
                    showed itself to be remarkably well informed. The Chinese reportedly had a
                    complete list of the assassinated generals by 11 a.m. October 1, which was 5
                    hours before this information was announced in Jakarta. The list included the
                    name of General Nasution (who had escaped assassination but whose inclusion
                    suggests that the Chinese had an advance PKI target list.)</p>
                <p>October 1 was also China's National day and it was apparently to be not only a
                    day of celebration of past victory on the China mainland but it was also to
                    coincide with a far-reaching new victory that would add the world's fifth most
                    populous nation to the Asian Communist Camp.</p>
                <p>The Communist failure in Indonesia was a severe setback for China, shattering its
                    alliance with Indonesia and its hopes for a radical tide sweeping over all the
                    developing world led by China. The famous Lin Piao speech of September 1965 had
                    boasted that the world village was surrounding the world city, which meant an
                    Asian Communist encirclement of the US and USSR. A successful Sino-Indonesian
                    alliance would also have created a giant pincer of China to the North and
                    Indonesia to the south within which the American forces in Vietnam would have
                    been caught. On the contrary, Indonesia under General Suharto crushed the PKI,
                    gradually removed Sukarno, established a New Order in Indonesia with close ties
                    with its neighbors and the West, rejoined the United Nations, and, along with
                    Thailand, took the lead in forming the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
                    (ASEAN). Indonesia also severed diplomatic ties with China.</p>
                <p>The extraordinary reversal in Indonesia in the period 1965-67 never received the
                    international attention it deserved, especially in the United States, which was
                    so totally preoccupied with Vietnam. Our Embassy in Jakarta was also at pains to
                    warn Washington against taking any credit for what happened in Indonesia. The
                    aborted coup was entirely an Indonesian performance in which we played no role
                    whatsoever. Any US government efforts to take credit for the reversal would only
                    bolster Communist claims that the US was involved in a plot to remove Sukarno
                    and the PKI.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>It is beyond my ken to estimate how the aborted Communist coup impacted on the
                    Chinese Communist leadership. In the short run, it seems to have spurred China's
                    self-destructive course toward the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,
                    putting US-Chinese relations in an even deeper freeze. But in the long run,
                    these setbacks and excesses strengthened the hand of the pragmatists led by Zhou
                    En-lai.</p>
                <p>One other event occurred while I was in Indonesia that came to have a bearing on
                    US-China policy. That occurred in the form of Mr. Richard Nixon's visit to
                    Jakarta in April 1967 where he was my wife's and my house guest for two days.
                    When Mr. Nixon and I called on President Suharto, Foreign Minister Malik and
                    others, Mr. Nixon took down notes on key points they made and when we got back
                    to my residence, we had a long conversation on events in Indonesia and the rest
                    of East Asia, especially China. Our conversation was tape-recorded by Mr. Nixon,
                    and when I asked him what he did with all these notes and tapes, he replied that
                    he had them transcribed, filed and cross-filed for later reference. For example,
                    I told him that the rate of inflation in Indonesia in 1965 was 635%. He included
                    that obscure fact in his Guam Doctrine press interview on July 27, 1969. His
                    tape-recording was, of course, to lead to his eventual undoing, but I remember
                    him as the best informed on foreign affairs of all the luminaries who visited
                    Jakarta during my four years there.</p>
                <p>This opinion of Mr. Nixon was reinforced when I read the article he wrote for the
                    Foreign Affairs Quarterly's October 1967 issue. In that article, which began
                    with a tribute to Indonesia's new leadership, Mr. Nixon made a strong case for
                    the US improving its relations with the Peoples Republic of China, a country
                    with one-quarter of the global population and with extensive strategic,
                    political and economic influence.</p>
                <p>During my last few months as Ambassador to Indonesia, I was assigned to serve
                    concurrently on the US negotiating team to the Paris talks on Vietnam; and in
                    March 1969 to being assigned as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and
                    the Pacific, a position I held for four years.</p>
                <p>This brought me back into the center of US-China relations, working for a
                    President who was destined to make those relations his greatest foreign policy

                <p>CHAPTER V</p>
                <p>THE REAL BEGINNINGS OF WASHINGTON-PEKING RAPPROCHEMENT1969-71</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Three months service on our Paris delegation provided opportunities to meet
                    President Nixon, Secretary Rogers and Dr. Kissinger (for the first time), and it
                    was clear from the moment I met the President in Paris that he recalled our
                    conversations in Jakarta two years earlier, calling me “low-profile Green”
                    because of the emphasis I had placed on maintaining a low-profile American
                    presence in Indonesia. I had also given a publicized talk to the American
                    Chamber of Commerce in Paris advocating more “Modesty, Mutuality and
                    Multilateralism” in the conduct of US foreign policy.</p>
                <p>Shortly thereafter, I was named Assistant Secretary of State, returning to
                    Washington to replace my old friend and Yale classmate, Bill Bundy. But before I
                    took over Bundy's job, I requested an opportunity to say farewell to friends in
                    Indonesia—especially Suharto and Malik. At the same time, I figured such a trip
                    to Indonesia would give me an opportunity to visit other countries in my area of
                    responsibility, and that, as the first emissary of the Nixon Administration to
                    be sent to that area, I should be in a position in conversations with Asian
                    leaders to reflect accurately the views of our new President.</p>
                <p>I accordingly requested a private White House meeting with the President, which
                    was granted. But before going over to the Oval Office, I co-drafted with
                    Ambassador Win Brown, my deputy, and with Bob Barnett, Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Economic Affairs (who had also been of
                    invaluable assistance to me in Indonesia), an informal three-page memorandum
                    setting forth what the three of us regarded as President Nixon's viewpoints on
                    key policy issues of interest to Asian leaders. This memorandum was based on
                    things the President had said or written or which we believed reflected his
                    viewpoint (or should).</p>
                <p>President Nixon approved my use of the memorandum but, just as he did so, in
                    walked Henry Kissinger who was visibly annoyed by my having by-passed him in
                    getting to the Oval Office.</p>
                <p>Upon my return from a long Asian trip in April 1969 that included meetings with
                    top leaders, I included in my written report to Secretary Rogers a statement
                    that there seemed to be a universally held judgment among all the Asian leaders
                    I met that China had never been in such a negative, truculent mood as it was at
                    that time. Asian leaders felt that any hope of progress in establishing a
                    constructive dialogue with China was out of the question until the Cultural
                    Revolution subsided.</p>
                <p>President Nixon pencilled “this is great” on my trip report when Secretary Rogers
                    sent him an abbreviated copy, and the President directed Kissinger to circulate
                    copies of the report to top officials in our foreign policy community.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The President showed continuing interest in achieving a breakthrough in our
                    frozen relationship with the PRC. I recall that on our return from his meeting
                    with Vietnamese President Thieu at Midway Island in early June 1969, President
                    Nixon invited me to his cabin on Air Force One where for nearly two hours we
                    discussed China and other Asian issues. The President was interested in the
                    history of our efforts to achieve some thaw in US-China relations. I also told
                    the President about my recent meeting with the old Gimo on Taiwan, where
                    President Chiang seemed out of touch with reality, at least on the Sino-Soviet
                    dispute which he regarded as a collusive effort by China and Russia to delude
                    and divide the West.</p>
                <p>The President stressed that we should try to remove unnecessary irritants in our
                    relations with China, but that we should not do this in a way that would
                    unnecessarily provoke the USSR, or that was designed to exploit Sino-Soviet
                    differences.</p>
                <p>Shortly thereafter in late July 1969, I accompanied President Nixon on the
                    Pacific-East Asian phase of his round-the-world trip. I had co-authored with Bob
                    Barnett the so-called “scope-paper” for that phase of his trip, and much of the
                    scope-paper's contents were reflected in Nixon's famous press backgrounder on
                    July 25 at Guam, the first stop of his trip. In the scope-paper I had emphasized
                    the great economic up-surge of East Asian countries and the growing ability of
                    most East Asian countries to assume greater burdens for their own defense. I
                    also said that our general position in East Asia should not be one of trying to
                    solve East Asia's problems but rather of helping East Asia's
                    problem-solvers.</p>
                <p>The President made several references to China in his backgrounder, including
                    modifications he hoped to see in permitting travel of Americans to China and
                    allowing limited tourist purchase of Chinese products.</p>
                <p>But what undoubtedly interested Peking most in the Guam backgrounder was the
                    President's thesis that (a) the U.S. would stand by its treaty commitments, (b)
                    the U.S. would provide a shield if a nuclear power threatened any U.S. ally or a
                    nation whose survival we considered vital to our own survival, and (c) the U.S.
                    looked to the country threatened to assume the primary responsibility for
                    providing the manpower for its own defense.</p>
                <p>The President also left it clear that the U.S. should learn from the experience
                    of Vietnam and not get caught in another comparable situation of “creeping
                    involvement.” “I want to be sure that our policies in the future, all over the
                    world...reduce American involvement.”</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>In retrospect, it is fair to assume that these statements of America's role in
                    the world helped set the stage for the Chinese-American rapprochement that was
                    to occur within two years of the Nixon Doctrine. [I did not attend the
                    President's press backgrounder in a hotel in Guam, but Nixon told the press that
                    I would answer any questions they might have on the backgrounder.] The President
                    also asked me to brief the large press corps accompanying him at our next two
                    stops in Manila and Jakarta. This assignment was one I could scarcely handle
                    since I did not attend the President's meetings with President Marcos or
                    President Suharto. No one from the State Department was included in these
                    meetings, not even Secretary Rogers or our Ambassadors. During 1969, the
                    Administration made a number of statements and moves, beyond those already
                    mentioned, to create a better climate in U.S. Chinese relations. We publicly
                    expressed our willingness to renew bilateral talks with the Chinese in Warsaw or
                    elsewhere; and Ambassador Stoessel in Warsaw was authorized by the President to
                    tell his Chinese colleague of the President's wish to discuss an improvement in
                    relations. All these statements and positions, including liberalization of
                    American travel and tourist purchases of Chinese products, were favorably
                    received by the great majority of our newspapers and members of Congress.</p>
                <p>Whereas the Chinese early in 1969 had castigated the Nixon Administration in the
                    harshest terms, Peking attacks moderated in the course of the year. Previously,
                    Chinese representatives conveyed to a number of foreigners their awareness that
                    U.S. policy toward China was under review. However they also made it clear that
                    the issue of Taiwan, including U.S. military forces deployed there, created a
                    major obstacle to any Sino-U.S. rapprochement. We also received indirect
                    official word from Peking that China appreciated U.S. restraint in not seeking
                    to exploit the Sino-Soviet dispute and that the U.S. obviously did not see a
                    Sino-Soviet war as being in its interests.</p>
                <p>In late 1969 it was announced that the U.S. would automatically validate
                    passports of persons in six categories for travel to the PRC. These categories
                    were members of Congress, journalists, teachers, scholars, medical doctors and
                    Red Cross representatives. On December 19, it was announced that foreign
                    subsidiaries of American companies would be permitted to sell China
                    non-strategic items of foreign manufacture, while U.S. companies were permitted
                    to buy or sell Chinese goods within or between foreign countries but not to
                    import Chinese goods to the U.S. U.S. tourist purchases of Chinese goods were
                    allowed without limit.</p>
                <p>All these and other moves to ease restrictions on U.S. travel and trade with
                    China were instituted either by our bureau or by the NSC where a Senior
                    Interdepartmental group chaired by my deputy, Ambassador Winthrop Brown,
                    prepared a policy study for Dr. Kissinger as the President's Assistant for
                    National Security Affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Our bureau was encouraged by the interest shown by the President in all these
                    moves to ease restrictions on U.S.-Chinese trade and travel, although we were
                    pressing for a complete lifting of all travel restrictions on Americans desiring
                    to visit China, and on all restrictions on Chinese bona fide visitors to the
                    U.S. These steps were finally approved by the White House in March and April of
                    1971.</p>
                <p>In the President's Foreign Policy Message to Congress in February 1970, Mr. Nixon
                    declared that the U.S. aim was to establish a “more normal and constructive
                    relationship with Communist China. He asserted that the U.S. had “historic ties
                    of friendship with the Chinese people, and many of our basic interests are not
                    in conflict.”</p>
                <p>1970 was not a significant year (like 1969 and 1971) in terms of changes in U.S.
                    policies towards China, but 1970 must have been an important year for Peking's
                    policymakers in determining the future course of China's relations with the
                    U.S., Japan and the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>We concluded at our Chiefs of Mission meeting in Tokyo in July 1970, attended by
                    the Ambassadors serving in the Western Pacific region and by Washington policy
                    makers concerned with that area that:</p>
                <p>(1) Peking is on the defensive, being acutely concerned over the Soviet military
                    build-up in Siberia.</p>
                <p>(2) Peking is worried that the U.S. will be pulling back militarily from the
                    Western Pacific, and is much concerned over future Japanese capabilities and
                    interests.</p>
                <p>(3) Peking is determined to heal the scars of the Cultural Revolution, and
                    rebuild the Party and the economy. The latter will entail a trade relationship
                    with the U.S. which advances China's development.</p>
                <p>These and other conclusions of the Conference, which was attended by Secretary
                    Rogers, were forwarded to President Nixon in a memorandum I drafted which
                    concluded:</p>
                <p>“We have no reason to apologize for the past. The very protection we extended to
                    the nations of Asia these last two decades has now permitted us to draw back
                    somewhat and, indeed, to focus on the dangers of our over-involvement (as in
                    Vietnam) and unwarranted tutelage. This is not a question of getting out of
                    Asia, but of finding the right way and right degree of staying in Asia....We
                    accept the risks—and yet the ultimate safety—of involvement.”</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>All during 1970 and early 1971 we continued to pursue our talks with the Chinese
                    in Warsaw—to no avail. Kissinger raised with the State Department the
                    possibility of sending a higher level emissary to Peking, but we questioned
                    whether the Warsaw talks could ever produce such a result. Furthermore, in the
                    absence of any clear signal from Peking that it would react favorably on any of
                    the issues we had raised in Warsaw over the years, it was doubtful that any
                    emissary would accomplish much. It never entered our minds in the State
                    Department how far the President would be willing to go in personally involving
                    himself in this politically sensitive issue.</p>
                <p>All the back channel soundings that the President and Dr. Kissinger were making
                    to Peking through third countries and various intermediaries in early 1971 were
                    carried out under the strictest security precautions—leaving us in the State
                    Department completely in the dark, except for the Secretary of State who was
                    kept informed.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, we recognized that the massive build-up of Soviet military
                    power in Siberia, hard along the northern frontier of China, was profoundly
                    disturbing to the Chinese leadership. This would entail a re-evaluation of
                    China's policy towards the great powers.</p>
                <p>The first overt indications of a new Chinese policy towards the United States
                    took a curious form. During an international ping-pong tournament in Japan in
                    April 1971, the Chinese team invited the American team to visit China—an
                    invitation the U.S. accepted and reciprocated. Shortly thereafter, the White
                    House authorized the State and Commerce Departments to liberalize foreign assets
                    control regulations affecting U.S. trade with China. Win Brown and Bob Barnett
                    spent many days with their Commerce colleagues working out necessary changes in
                    the Federal Register.</p>
                <p>U.S. policy towards China, and the Chinese representative issue in the UN, were
                    major topics for discussion at our Chiefs of Mission meeting which I chaired in
                    Baguio, the Philippines, May 17-20, 1971.</p>
                <p>Walter McConaughy, U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of China on Taiwan,
                    reluctantly concluded that a change of U.S. tactics would be required if there
                    were to be any real chance of preventing the ouster or walk-out of the GRC at
                    the UNGA session in October. Eight more countries had recognized Peking during
                    the previous few months, and even the GRC itself realized that perhaps a dual
                    representation formula (seating both Chinas in the UN) was its only chance for
                    survival in the UN. However the GRC was adamant, according to McConaughy, on the
                    subject of the GRC representing China in the UN Security Council—a solution
                    Peking would almost certainly reject.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Our Consulate General in Hong Kong, represented by Consul General David Osborn,
                    made what turned out to be a remarkably prophetic analysis of the terms under
                    which a Washington-Peking rapprochement could be achieved without the U.S.
                    abandoning its commitments to the Republic of China.</p>
                <p>According to our official account of the Chiefs of Mission Conference in 1971,
                    Consul General Osborn said:</p>
                <p>“Regarding the status of Taiwan, we should say that we do not disagree with
                    claims of both parties that Taiwan is a province of China. We are deluding
                    ourselves if we believe we can have good relations with the PRC without such a
                    declaration.”</p>
                <p>As a second point, Dave Osborn said he did not believe we need remove our
                    military forces from Taiwan completely to have better relations with the
                    mainland. We must, however, start moving in that direction.</p>
                <p>As a third point, he said we should de-emphasize verbally our bilateral security
                    treaty with the GRC, while continuing to keep that treaty in force.</p>
                <p>In the fourth place (Osborn concluded) we should continue to favor a peaceful
                    resolution of GRC-PRC problems through direct talks, but we should low-key this
                    in our public output. Usually it is better for us to say nothing and let the
                    countries directly concerned work out their own problems.</p>
                <p>Osborn and I agreed that Peking was now moving in a more pragmatic direction,
                    making it probable that Peking would accept a U.S. position embodying the above
                    four points.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, as earlier stated, unbeknownst to all of us in the State Department
                    (except Secretary Rogers), Henry Kissinger and a few key White House colleagues
                    were involved in highly secret preparations for Henry Kissinger's trip to Peking
                    in June 1971.</p>
                <p>The President had a passion for secrecy based in part on his distrust of the
                    bureaucracy. Never was secrecy more strictly pursued as it was over preparations
                    for the Kissinger trip, and with considerable justification. Had word leaked
                    out, it might have raised all kinds of criticisms from the right wing of the
                    Republican party, not to mention deep concern in Taiwan, Japan and other
                    countries affected.</p>

                <p>So I am not faulting Nixon and Kissinger for their secret diplomacy, although not
                    informing people who are expected to be informed can give rise to some real
                    dangers. Let me cite a specific example. I recall meeting one morning in June
                    1971 with several key members of my staff, one of whom mentioned that it had
                    just been announced over the radio that Dr. Kissinger, who was in Pakistan on a
                    round-the-world trip, had contracted a case of intestinal flu, and was therefore
                    planning to take several days rest by motoring up from Islamabad to the Pakistan
                    mountain resort area of Murree.</p>
                <p>I commented to my staff that this was ridiculous—that no one with what we used to
                    call “Delhi belly” would take off on a long bumpy motor trip. I then observed
                    blandly that Henry was probably off on a secret trip to China.</p>
                <p>As soon as I said those words, it occurred to me that my impromptu speculation,
                    if true, would immediately spread to the newspapers, and I would be responsible
                    for the worst leak of the Nixon administration. So I quickly excused myself from
                    my meeting, dashed up to Secretary Rogers' office, and told him what had
                    happened. The Secretary paled visibly, for I had uncovered the truth. On his
                    instructions, I rushed back to my office and swore all present to utter secrecy
                    about my speculation. They kept the secret.</p>
                <p>Such are the dangers of not telling officials of events occurring in their area
                    of responsibility.</p>
                <p>Right after the President amazed the world with his widely televised revelations
                    in the summer of 1971 about Henry's trip to Peking and plans for the President
                    to visit China the following February, I received a telephone call from
                    Secretary Rogers who was with Nixon in San Clemente. He asked what I thought of
                    the announcement. I said it was great, but that we were going to have problems
                    with the Japanese. Secretary Rogers seemed surprised, pointing out that we had
                    given Prime Minister Sato several hours advance notice of the President's
                    announcement (as indeed we had to other allies). I said that the announcement
                    nevertheless left Prime Minister Sato in a most embarrassing political position.
                    For years we had been urging restraint on other countries about opening
                    relations with Peking; and the Japanese, largely out of deference to us, had
                    continued to vote in the UN against the seating of Peking's representatives in
                    China's UN seat. And now we had secretly reached Peking before Japan (known as
                    Sato's nightmare), exposing the Japanese government to the first of what were to
                    be several “Nixon Shockus” that rocked U.S.-Japanese relations.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I told Secretary Rogers that Dick Ericson (Director of Japanese Affairs)
                    and I would work immediately on a draft message from Nixon to Sato explaining
                    the reasons for tight security and apologizing for any embarrassments this might
                    have caused our most important Asian ally. Our draft message, telexed the next
                    morning to San Clemente, was approved by the President, but I doubt it did much
                    to allay Sato's concerns.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>In his memoirs published in 1984, Under Secretary U. Alexis Johnson, a former
                    U.S. Ambassador to Japan and close friend of Sato's, revealed that he had been
                    alerted by Nixon to fly out to Tokyo to give Sato advance notice in a way that
                    would show special consideration for Japan. But, for some reason, the White
                    House canceled the Johnson trip.</p>
                <p>The President's announcement was an even greater shock to President Chiang
                    Kai-shek and to the Republic of China on Taiwan—but there wasn't much we could
                    do to allay the shock. Indeed, the President's impending trip to China had the
                    effect of completely undermining the position our government had taken year
                    after year in marshaling international support for the Republic of China
                    (Taiwan) retaining China's seat in the UN.</p>
                <p>Not that I found this to be any great loss—the eventual seating of the PRC was
                    inevitable—but we in the State Department were nevertheless under orders from
                    Nixon in 1971, even after the President's China trip was announced, to do all we
                    could to preserve the GRC's position in the UN. It took a lot of our time and
                    effort—and eventually we lost.</p>
                <p>During the autumn of 1971, Jack Service, who in the 1940's was the most able of
                    all the State Department China-language officers and who was later hounded out
                    of the service by McCarthyism, made a trip to China with his wife, Caroline, as
                    personal guests of Premier Zhou En-lai. I, as Jack's close friend from the days
                    back in 1946-47 when we had served together in New Zealand, visited the Services
                    on their return to Berkeley, California, where Jack gave me a blow-by-blow
                    account of his China trip, as we walked all over the hills of Berkeley.</p>
                <p>Jack met with the top leaders whom he had known from the World War II days when
                    they were together in the Yenan Caves. He found the Cultural Revolution rapidly
                    subsiding. It was clear that Zhou En-lai, in particular, was preparing the way
                    for serious productive talks with Nixon. The key issue would be Taiwan. Zhou
                    recognized that the U.S. could not switch its policy overnight and that some
                    evolution over time would be required. From Peking's viewpoint, it was
                    absolutely essential that the U.S. not promote or encourage any Taiwan
                    independence movement. If the U.S. looked for a successful outcome of President
                    Nixon's trip, it must accept Taiwan as an integral part of China. Of less
                    immediate consequence was the removal of U.S. forces on Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Jack Service's account was of interest in many regards, especially his account of
                    the notable improvements that had taken place in the lives of most Chinese
                    people over the last two decades. Jack reported Zhou's surprise over the PRC
                    victory (October 25, 1971) on the UN seating issue. The Chinese clearly had not
                    anticipated this favorable result. During his conversation with Zhou En-lai on
                    October 27, 1971, there were constant staff interruptions with regard to
                    developments in New York and hasty arrangements for China's participation in the
                    UN. I reported Jack's views to the White House, State and CIA.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Also during October Henry Kissinger made another trip to China to prepare for the
                    Presidential visit and to do some initial work on the final (Shanghai)
                    communiqu� which was to set forth what was agreed to at the summit meetings.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER VI</p>
                <p>PRESIDENT NIXON'S TRIP TO CHINA, 1972</p>
                <p>Nearly 200 people accompanied the President to China, including security
                    personnel, administrative staff, press and others. The official party numbered
                    13, ranked as follows: President Nixon, Secretary Rogers, Dr. Kissinger,
                    Presidential Assistant Bob Haldeman, Press Secretary Ron Ziegler, Presidential
                    Military Adviser Brent Scowcroft, Assistant Secretary Green, Presidential Deputy
                    Assistant Dwight Chapin, Speechwriter Pat Buchanan, Personal Presidential
                    Secretary Rose Mary Woods, State Department Director of Asia Communist Affairs
                    Al Jenkins, NSC staff member Foreign Service Officer John Holdridge, and Special
                    Assistant to Kissinger Winston Lord.But it was clear from our initial seat
                    assignments in the Presidential plane that the White House was going to dominate
                    the show and that the State Department was to take a back seat literally.</p>
                <p>While in Hawaii enroute to China, I had a useful meeting with Dr. Kissinger who
                    gave me the benefit of what he had learned about negotiating with the Chinese,
                    based on his two recent visits to Peking. Kissinger suggested our meeting in
                    Hawaii since I would be assisting Secretary Rogers in handling what were known
                    as the “counterpart talks” with the Chinese Foreign Minister and his staff. The
                    counterpart talks dealt essentially with specific problem areas like trade,
                    travel, consular affairs, property rights, while leaving broad strategic issues
                    to the top level, namely Mao, Zhou En-lai, Nixon and Kissinger.</p>
                <p>“Never,” I recall Henry Kissinger saying to me, “use the language of the
                    marketplace in dealing with top Chinese officials. Don't talk about deals or
                    quid-pro-quos. Always talk about principles...That as a matter of principle we
                    are prepared to do so-and-so, and that we would trust that you as a matter of
                    principle would do this or that...” “The Chinese,” he added, “are real
                    puritans—not like you New Englanders.”</p>
                <p>“Another thing,” Henry added, “is that the Chinese have a lot of things to get
                    off their chests—decades of humiliations at the hands of the imperialist West.
                    The Foreign Minister may well spend two full days sounding off on that subject
                    before he is willing to get into substance. Don't interrupt him. Let hem get it
                    out of his system. If you interrupt to rebut him, he'll start all over again—and
                    you'll get nowhere.” (He implied that this is what almost happened to him.)</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>That was Kissinger at his best—astute, articulate, a master of maneuver. But he
                    was also a megalomaniac, and as long as he was in the White House he lost no
                    opportunity to build his power base at the expense of the State Department,
                    undercutting the Secretary of State and shamelessly exploiting President Nixon's
                    long-standing suspicions and prejudices against careerists in the State
                    Department (despite our loyalty to all Presidents and our high respect for
                    Nixon's extraordinary grasp of strategic issues).</p>
                <p>For Secretary Rogers, the China trip had many humiliating moments, especially not
                    being asked to accompany President Nixon (and Kissinger) to their only meeting
                    with Chairman Mao Zedong. Secretary Rogers was uncomplaining because he did not
                    want to add in any way to the President's problems.</p>
                <p>The crowning achievement of the Nixon China Trip was the final communiqu�—known
                    as the Shanghai Communiqu�—which was to become the charter of our new
                    relationship with China. The format of the communiqu� was in itself unusual.
                    Each side—first China, then the U.S.—presented its contrasting view of the world
                    scene and the main tenets of its foreign policies. This was followed by
                    identifying areas of understanding and agreement. In this section the U.S.
                    acknowledged that “all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain
                    there is but one China and that Taiwan is part of China. The U.S. does not
                    challenge that position.” On the thorny issue of withdrawing U.S. forces and
                    military installations on Taiwan, the U.S. stated this to be its ultimate
                    objective, but related it to a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the
                    Chinese themselves: meanwhile the U.S. would progressively reduce its military
                    presence on Taiwan as tension in the area diminished.</p>
                <p>Credit for the negotiation of this document must go largely to Henry Kissinger
                    and his Chinese counterpart Vice-Minister Chiao Kuan-hua. Dr. Kissinger went
                    through the motions of consulting Secretary Rogers and the rest of the State
                    Department contingent. From time to time Rogers and I would meet with Kissinger
                    or we would receive sections of the draft communiqu� for our comments, but at no
                    stage did I ever see the entire draft until it was already approved by the
                    President, Kissinger, Rogers and the Chinese leaders.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>The first opportunity I was given to read the approved draft was on February 26,
                    the day we left Peking for a one-day rest stop at the scenic city of Hangzhou
                    before our final day at Shanghai. When we reached our hotel in Hangzhou,
                    Secretary Rogers showed me the approved text. I read it rapidly, detecting a
                    major flaw which I immediately drew to Rogers' attention. He agreed with me, and
                    so did Al Jenkins. The flaw was simply this: although the U.S. reaffirmed in the
                    text of the Communiqu� its support for U.S. security treaty obligations to
                    Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, SEATO and ANZUS, no mention was
                    made of our treaty obligations to the Republic of China on Taiwan. This would
                    almost certainly be seized upon by the world press, and especially by those in
                    the Republican party who were opposed to the President's trip, [Even top cabinet
                    officials like Vice President Agnew and Treasury Secretary John Connally had
                    privately expressed strong concerns over the President's trip to China.] to
                    charge that the President had sold the Republic of China down the river, that
                    the U.S. had unilaterally terminated without advance notice its treaty
                    obligations to the ROC, and that this could even be interpreted as suggesting to
                    Peking that it could attack Taiwan without involving the U.S.</p>
                <p>Rogers could see my point right away. He, too, remembered how Secretary of State
                    Dean Acheson had come under heavy fire for excluding South Korea from a map
                    showing those areas in East Asia of primary defense concern to the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>Secretary Rogers immediately put in a telephone call to the President who was
                    staying at the nearby government guesthouse, but he got Haldeman on the phone
                    instead. Haldeman refused to disturb the President who was resting—besides, he
                    said, the President had already approved the draft.</p>
                <p>I was in a black mood that night at the dinner party given in the President's
                    honor by the Hangzhou Revolutionary Committee. Ziegler noted my mood and asked
                    what had happened. When I told him, he evidently then got in touch with
                    Haldeman.</p>
                <p>Around 1 or 2 a.m., John Scali beat on my door and said that “all hell had broken
                    loose in the Presidential suite.” Evidently Haldeman or Rogers had got to the
                    President about the issue, and the President was enraged.</p>
                <p>According to Henry Kissinger's memoirs, the President was furious at the State
                    Department for belatedly coming up with a long series of nitpicks about the
                    Communiqu�, and yet failure to correct these nitpicks, the President allegedly
                    feared, might result in the State Department bad-mouthing the Communiqu�. Henry
                    depicted the President as “storming about the beautiful guest house in Hangzhou
                    in his underwear,” swearing that “he would do something about that State
                    Department at the first opportunity—a threat he made at regular intervals since
                    my first interview with him....”</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Well, of course, there was no series of nit-picks—just one major objection—a
                    point which, amazingly, no one had spotted until I drew it to Rogers' attention;
                    and it is quite possible that the President's fury was directed at Kissinger for
                    having put him on the spot.</p>
                <p>The following morning, at breakfast, Secretary Rogers told me that he had managed
                    to reach President Nixon late the previous evening to express our concerns. He
                    said he didn't know what the President would do. After breakfast, we left for
                    the airport to go to Shanghai. While proceeding to my plane, Henry Kissinger
                    intercepted me. He was angry about what he termed my “poor-mouthing of the
                    Communiqu�.”</p>
                <p>For the first time in my three years of association with Henry, I did not hold
                    back. “Since when was the Secretary of State offering constructive criticisms
                    defined as poor-mouthing?” I further reminded him of the constitutional
                    responsibilities of the Secretary of State to advise the President—especially on
                    an issue as critical as this, one that could affect the whole outcome of the
                    President's trip.</p>
                <p>“But you've been talking to Scali, who has no right to be involved,” was Henry's
                    weak retort, to which I replied that Scali had a right to know as press adviser
                    to the President. Henry then did an about-face. He asked with a seeming genuine
                    warmth if I would join him that evening in briefing the world press at the time
                    of the issuance of the Shanghai Communiqu�.</p>
                <p>I replied that I would do so if the President so ordered. I was not happy about
                    the prospect of being conspicuously identified with a communiqu� I found badly
                    flawed, and it was left unclear whether that flaw would remain in the
                    Communiqu�.</p>
                <p>So I arrived in Shanghai in an angry mood until it was revealed to me later in
                    the day that Kissinger had worked out with the Chinese Vice Minister late the
                    previous evening a way of handling the problem I'd raised.</p>
                <p>I was also told that the President specifically asked that I accompany Kissinger
                    to the press briefing and that I participate to the extent of summarizing what
                    had gone on in the counterpart talks between Secretary Rogers and the Chinese
                    Foreign Minister.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Kissinger never told me specifically what arrangements he had concluded with the
                    Chinese side regarding the critical objection I had raised, but during our
                    briefing of a large press gathering in Shanghai at 6 p.m., February 27, it
                    simply took the form of an agreed removal of the offending sentence from the
                    Communiqu� and of Henry stating in answer to an anticipated question from the
                    press, actually Mr. Kraslow of The Los Angeles Times who asked, “Why did not the
                    U.S. government affirm its Treaty commitment to Taiwan, as the President and you
                    have done on numerous occasions?” Kissinger answered that this issue was an
                    extraordinarily difficult one to discuss at that time and place, but, he then
                    added the key passage: “we stated our basic position with respect to this issue
                    in the President's World Report, in which we said that this Treaty will be
                    maintained. Nothing has changed on that position.” Kissinger said he hoped that
                    that would be all he would have to say on that subject—and his request was
                    respected.</p>
                <p>Thus was adroitly averted what could have been a serious setback. Neither Henry
                    nor the President ever thanked me for my initiative. President Nixon
                    understandably acted as though the event never occurred, while Kissinger took it
                    upon himself to leave history with a self-serving account of the incident—one
                    that is misleading and damaging to the State Department, and one that I am now,
                    many years later, moved to refute.</p>
                <p>In any event, this red-letter day concluded on a most pleasant note. I was asked
                    to meet with President Nixon in his hotel room at 10:30 p.m. to discuss the trip
                    which I was about to undertake with John Holdridge, in which we would call on
                    the top leaders of all East Asian and Australasian countries in the course of
                    two weeks to explain American policy in the wake of the Shanghai Communiqu� and
                    to answer questions.</p>
                <p>The President was warm and gracious. He gave me instructions as to what I should
                    say about his talks in China—their frankness, their lack of double-talk, the
                    fact that there were no secret agreements or understandings—it was all out in
                    the open as presented in the revealed record. He also urged that I stress
                    America's constancy of purpose and its continuing search, in consultation with
                    our allies, for “finding the right way to stay in Asia,” and that under all
                    circumstances we would stand by our commitments. He also gave me special
                    instructions regarding Korea and Thailand.</p>
                <p>In assigning John Holdridge to be my assistant, he ensured that we would be in a
                    more authoritative position to answer certain questions relating to the top
                    level talks with Zhou En-lai which John had attended as an NSC adviser to
                    Kissinger and as an interpreter.</p>
                <p>That was the last full day of the President's trip to China. He took off the
                    following morning from Shanghai with all his party (save for John Holdridge and
                    me) direct for Washington by way of Anchorage, Alaska.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>For me, the most exhilarating and important moments of the trip all occurred that
                    last day—my final meeting with Henry Kissinger which turned out so
                    satisfactorily, our joint briefing of the Press (in which he did almost all of
                    the talking and answering of questions), and my final meeting with the President
                    late that evening (February 27). But there was one other event that day which
                    deserves special mention.</p>
                <p>In the course of the afternoon, Premier Zhou En-lai made a personal call on
                    Secretary of State Rogers in his hotel room which I was asked to join.
                    [Secretary Rogers' suite and mine were on the 13th floor, Kissinger's on the
                    14th floor and the Nixons were on the top floor, the 15th. The symbolism escaped
                    no one.] In the course of this call, the subject of my flying direct to Tokyo
                    from Shanghai was raised by Secretary Rogers. Our earlier application to the
                    Chinese government for permission for this flight had gone unanswered. We
                    realized the uniqueness of our application, for no plane of any nation had flown
                    either way between China and Japan in the preceding 23 years. So when Bill
                    Rogers raised the question with Premier Zhou in our hotel meeting, Zhou just
                    smiled and said through his interpreter: “Mr. Secretary, you just go ahead and
                    do what you think is right.”</p>
                <p>Zhou never gave his permission, but he never denied permission. He thereby
                    established no precedent which someone else could invoke. [The thought later
                    occurred to me that Zhou's unusual courtesy call on the Secretary of State might
                    have been prompted by concerns expressed to him by Nixon or Kissinger over the
                    State Department's “poor-mouthing” of the Communiqu�. In other words, Kissinger,
                    in justifying to Chiao Kuan-hua the last-minute change in the Communiqu� that I
                    had urged, had probably talked about how the State Department might otherwise
                    “poor-mouth” (a favorite term of Kissinger's) the Communiqu� and thereby
                    undermine much of what the Shanghai Communiqu� purported to accomplish. Zhou was
                    also mindful of how shabbily the State had been treated by the White House and
                    wished to offset this by his courtesy call on the Secretary. Zhou, in typical
                    Chinese fashion, was keenly aware of the need for officials to save face.]</p>
                <p>It all worked out fine, and when, the next day, following President Nixon's
                    departure, I took off in the President's back-up plane for Tokyo, Premier Zhou
                    actually drove down to our plane to say farewell to John Holdridge and me. For
                    the first time, in my hearing, Premier Zhou spoke English: “Goodbye, Mr. Green,
                    have a good trip. Good luck.” He knew I faced some difficult moments, especially
                    when I reached Taiwan where I was scheduled to meet with President Chiang
                    Kai-shek. I left China feeling that Zhou En-lai was perhaps the most remarkable
                    of all leaders in terms of his broad command of world events and yet his
                    extraordinary attention to detail.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER VII</p>
                <p>AFTERMATH OF NIXON TRIP—ASIAN AND U.S. REACTIONS</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Arriving in Tokyo on February 28, John Holdridge and I were met by my wife and by
                    special assistant, Paul Cleveland. We four were to make the long journey from
                    Tokyo to Seoul, Manila, Saigon, Phnom Penh, Vientiane, Bangkok, Singapore,
                    Jakarta, Sydney, Canberra, Wellington and back to Washington. From Tokyo to
                    Singapore, we traveled in a small executive jet provided by the Commander in
                    Chief of the Pacific. The rest of the trip was by commercial airlines.</p>
                <p>The most challenging talks I had were in Tokyo and Taipei. As The New York Times
                    put it on the day of our arrival in Tokyo: “The Japanese press is beside itself
                    in frustration—and the government is not far behind—that Japan's overtures
                    toward normal government relations with Peking have been spurned; while
                    President Nixon has been welcomed. China professes to fear revived Japanese
                    militarism and Japanese economic hegemony in Asia.”</p>
                <p>My meetings with Prime Minister Sato and Foreign Minister Fukuda were
                    nevertheless warm and friendly, based on many years' acquaintance, even though
                    they were under criticism in Japan for the way the U.S. had overtaken Japan in
                    the race to Peking. They were also anxious for “inside” information regarding
                    what had transpired in the summit meetings in Peking beyond what was already
                    announced. This placed me in a bit of a spot because I had not been directly
                    involved in the top-level negotiations with Zhou—a fact known to the Japanese
                    press. On the other hand, Kissinger and President Nixon had given me background
                    and guidance, and John Holdridge had attended most of the summit meetings.</p>
                <p>The Japanese government had already made favorable official statements about the
                    Shanghai Communiqu� before our arrival in Tokyo, and the government's statements
                    after my departure would indicate that our talks in Tokyo had gone well in the
                    sense of removing suspicions that there were secret deals in Peking, perhaps
                    involving Japan, in reaffirming our defense commitment to Taiwan, and in
                    suggesting that we had no desire to beat Japan in any race toward diplomatic
                    recognition of Peking.</p>
                <p>The two things I remember most vividly about our busy schedule of calls in Korea
                    were: (1) the 90-minute grilling I had from the Korean Foreign Minister with
                    regard to every detail of the President's China Trip, plus my assessment of each
                    detail's implications, and (2) the friendly solicitude expressed by my old
                    friend (and one-time adversary) President Park Chung-Hee regarding my personal
                    safety when visiting Taiwan in view of the strongly adverse reactions he
                    anticipated there.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>I accordingly prepared careful talking points during the Seoul-Taipei flight in
                    our 4-passenger jet—points that I later checked with Ambassador McConaughy in
                    Taipei before our meetings with top ROC officials. President Chiang Kai-shek
                    refused to see us, but his able, level-headed son, Chiang Ching-kuo, who was
                    Premier at the time and later President of the ROC, was our gracious, albeit
                    dismayed host. I assured the Premier and Foreign Minister Chow that, while we
                    had modified our policy toward Peking, we had not changed our policy toward the
                    ROC with which we continued to have diplomatic relations and a defense
                    commitment. We also expected to do even more to encourage trade and investment
                    in Taiwan. In the Shanghai Communiqu� we made explicit our view that there is
                    but one China, rejecting any suggesting that we favor a two-China policy or a
                    one-China, one-Taiwan policy. We do not pretend, I added, to know how the Taiwan
                    issue will eventually be settled. This is a problem to be resolved by the
                    Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. We only insist on the issue being
                    resolved peacefully.</p>
                <p>After a busy day of meetings in which these themes were stressed, and many
                    questions answered by John Holdridge and me, I said to the Foreign Minister at
                    our final meeting that I hoped his government would not convey an impression of
                    dismay and bitterness over President Nixon's China initiative, for that would
                    only give satisfaction to those who are enemies of the ROC and instill fears on
                    the part of Taiwan's business contacts. The ROC has many strong friends in the
                    U.S. and elsewhere, and it must remain that way.</p>
                <p>Subsequently our Embassy reported that reactions in Taiwan remained skeptical but
                    the “GRC leaders were impressed with Green's reaffirmation of the defense
                    commitment and most interested in his comment that he believed Peking is
                    prepared to accept the status quo in Taiwan for an indefinite period. Most
                    important of all, the GRC leaders did not engage in a further public quarrel
                    with the U.S. Private comments also indicated relief and a shift from earlier
                    sharp criticism.”</p>
                <p>With the help of Walter McConaughy and John Holdridge, my difficult mission to
                    Taiwan succeeded.</p>
                <p>Our next stop after a scary flight through a tropical electrical storm was
                    Manila, a scene of utter confusion. Mrs. Marcos was taking off for Peking just
                    as we landed. Our ashen-faced Ambassador, Hank Byroade, explained that Mrs.
                    Marcos was looking for new relations with Peking, now that the U.S. had
                    allegedly changed its policy. Byroade also said that I was being served with a
                    subpoena to appear the following day before the Philippine Senate to answer
                    questions about “how the U.S. was reneging on its 2-China policy,” which Foreign
                    Minister Romulo had thought we were pursuing. The Philippine press reaction was
                    shrill and irrational, urging that, since the U.S. had jettisoned Taiwan, the
                    Philippines should now negotiate a deal with Peking.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>According to the Embassy's telegraphic reports of my 36 hours stay in Manila, my
                    meetings with Marcos, Romulo, the Philippine Senate, the press, etc. had been
                    “indispensable in halting the snowballing erosion in Philippine confidence in
                    U.S. Asian policy.”</p>
                <p>Our meetings in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos were held in a calmer atmosphere and
                    went off without incident, except for President Lon Nol's unexplained absence
                    from Phnom Penh. I had little regard for him anyway and was glad to have my
                    meetings instead with Sirik Matak, the Foreign Minister, a wise and courageous
                    man.</p>
                <p>The King of Thailand, reflecting the sentiment of his government and people,
                    expressed to me profound skepticism of PRC intentions and of U.S. ability and
                    preparedness to deal realistically with the Chinese. However on our departure
                    from Bangkok after long separate meetings with the King, the Prime Minister, the
                    Foreign Minister, the National Executive Council, the SEATO Secretary General,
                    and the press, the Thai government released a statement describing our talks as
                    “most satisfactory to both sides while at the same time creating excellent
                    mutual understanding.” The usually critical leading newspaper The Nation said I
                    had done a “superb job in allaying suspicions.” During my talks in Thailand I
                    was in a position to provide private assurances that Peking was likely to
                    reduce, and possibly terminate, material support for Communist insurgents
                    operating in Thailand.</p>
                <p>Our stops in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore were relatively uneventful but entirely
                    satisfactory.</p>
                <p>Indonesia posed a special problem in terms of Indonesia's deep suspicions of the
                    Chinese, who were regarded as co-conspirators with the Indonesian Communist
                    Party in assassinating 6 of Indonesia's top 8 generals in the aborted coup of
                    September 30, 1965. On the other hand, President Suharto, Foreign Minister
                    Malik, and the Army leaders welcomed Nixon's China Trip as offering hope for
                    peace and stability. Press coverage emphasized my assurances that there had been
                    no change in U.S. commitments and no secret deals.</p>
                <p>In Australia there was no need to explain or justify the President's trip to
                    China. It was widely accepted as a sensible move. However, Australia posed an
                    interesting challenge since the leader of the Labor Party opposition, Gough
                    Whitlam (who was Prime Minister during my assignment to Australia 1973-75) had
                    adopted the position that Australia should now establish relations with the PRC.
                    The leader of the Country Party was similarly interested in early recognition of
                    Peking as giving Australia a diplomatic advantage in selling wheat and other
                    farm products to the huge China market. I found myself in something of a
                    quandary in justifying the President's opening to China on the one hand and
                    advising caution regarding any Australian move to recognize Peking on the other.
                    All I could do was suggest that Australia might be best advised to adopt a
                    wait-and-see policy before any moves to break relations with the GOC on Taiwan
                    in order to recognize Peking.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>New Zealand, our last stop, was delightfully relaxing. After a useful 2 hour talk
                    with Prime Minister Marshall and Foreign Minister Holyoake, the Prime Minister
                    suggested that we conclude our talks on the Heretaunga Golf Course, which we
                    did. Sir Keith Holyoake told the press that my “briefing was the best one he had
                    ever heard in his life.” This was a pleasant note on which to end a trip that
                    had covered a dozen countries in fifteen days.</p>
                <p>In looking back on this trip, my wife remarked on the wisdom of President Nixon
                    in entrusting this mission to Foreign Service officers who were not only
                    well-known personally to leaders of the Western Pacific region, but who were
                    seen by them as careerists with no political axes to grind.</p>
                <p>On our return to Washington, I reported to the House Foreign Affairs Committee
                    and to the White House, before going on the nation-wide NBC program “Meet the
                    Press.” The President, when I met with him on March 23, along with Al Haig,
                    Deputy Head of the NSC, and John Holdridge, was anxious that I play down the
                    Taiwan aspect as much as possible in my “Meet the Press” appearance. He did not
                    want me to make any headlines—and I did not disappoint him in that regard. Al
                    Haig called me up after my NBC performance on March 26 to say “they didn't lay a
                    glove on you” which was the highest compliment I received for what I fear was a
                    lackluster TV performance, given my instructions.</p>
                <p>There was one further development in which I was involved in 1972, relating
                    primarily to our relations with Japan, but also involved U.S. policy toward
                    China.</p>
                <p>Prime Minister Sato resigned in mid-1972 and was replaced by Prime Minister
                    Tanaka who had already announced his intention to negotiate later that year with
                    the Chinese on normalizing Tokyo's relations with Peking.</p>
                <p>On August 30, 1972, I accompanied President Nixon to Hawaii where Nixon and
                    Tanaka met for the first time, largely to get to know each other and to discuss
                    issues of concern.</p>
                <p>I recall that on our flight from San Clemente on Air Force One to Hawaii, there
                    was a long meeting in the President's cabin attended by the President, Secretary
                    Rogers, Dr. Kissinger, Under Secretary U. Alexis Johnson and myself, in which
                    Alex did most of the talking. He had previously been our Ambassador to Japan and
                    felt strongly that President Nixon and Dr. Kissinger had unnecessarily affronted
                    the Japanese in the way we had suddenly shifted our policy toward Peking in
                    1971-72 without adequate consultation or even notification of Japan.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>It was clear that Prime Minister Tanaka was now going to move rapidly, under
                    strong internal Japanese political pressure, to normalize Tokyo-Peking
                    relations. Some concern was expressed in our Air Force One meeting that Tanaka
                    might normalize on terms adversely affecting U.S. interests, but President Nixon
                    seemed surer than the rest of us that Tanaka and Zhou would act responsibly and
                    that we should not press the Japanese on this issue at our forthcoming meeting
                    at Kuilima, Hawaii.</p>
                <p>Since the President's main meetings in Kuilima with Tanaka were strictly private
                    and separate from the plenary talks, I have no way of knowing whether
                    China-Japan issues were discussed. But, in any event, when Tanaka did go to
                    Peking several weeks later, he was evidently under no pressure from the Chinese
                    to accept terms that would create difficulties in U.S.-Japanese relations. In
                    fact, China seemed to be at pains not only to improve relations with Japan, but
                    also with the United States and between Japan and the United States.</p>
                <p>Commencing then, in 1972, for the first time in memory, a foundation was laid for
                    a constructive relationship between Washington, Peking and Tokyo; that is to
                    say, between the world's most powerful nation, the world's most populous nation
                    and the world's most economically dynamic nation—all three of them having been
                    at war with each other at some point earlier in this century.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER VIII</p>
                <p>CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS</p>
                <p>When future historians contemplate the events of this century, few things will
                    stand out more prominently than the interface between China and the United
                    States. Barbara Tuchman's Stilwell and the American Experience in China captures
                    all the frustrations of our war-time allied relations when she writes in her
                    final sentence: “In the end, China went her own way, as if the Americans had
                    never come.”</p>
                <p>Thereafter, for over two decades, U.S. relations with mainland China remained in
                    a deep freeze. There was a brief period between late 1961 and early 1964 that
                    offered some hope that relations might thaw a bit due to Chinese reactions to
                    the excesses of the Great Leap Forward and to initiatives from the American side
                    to enter into a more civil discourse with China. This period was marked by U.S.
                    efforts to relax certain restrictions on American travel to, and trade with,
                    China. It was also marked by U.S. pressures, known to Peking, to restrain our
                    Chinese allies on Taiwan from raids against the mainland, especially during the
                    period of economic and social unrest resulting from the collapsed Great Leap
                    Forward.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>However, it takes two to tango, and there was no evidence of Peking's willingness
                    to relax tensions with the U.S. even during the 1961-64 period. The U.S. was
                    nevertheless able to demonstrate that it was Chinese, not U.S., policy that was
                    principally responsible for the continuing deep freeze in our relations.</p>
                <p>The Chinese government was obviously averse to any gradual improvements in its
                    relations with the U.S. As I pointed out at Princeton in mid-1965: The Chinese
                    Communist leaders have remarked that when the time comes to improve relations
                    with the U.S., “this will come all at once, inasmuch as to improve relations
                    piecemeal would have a harmful effect on the Chinese people's revolutionary
                    fervor.”</p>
                <p>Partly as a result of the setback to China caused by the aborted Communist coup
                    in Indonesia in 1965, China entered into another dark period of left-wing
                    fanaticism known as the Cultural Revolution which did not abate until 1969.
                    Intensified efforts were made by China during that period to cast the U.S. in
                    the devil's role in order to whip up mass fears of an external threat and
                    thereby achieve national cohesion.</p>
                <p>A major reversal of Chinese strategic policy occurred in the period 1969-71,
                    brought on by increasing Chinese nervousness over Soviet intentions. The Soviet
                    invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, followed by the rapid build-up of Soviet
                    military power in Siberia, especially in disputed areas along the Chinese
                    frontier, created an atmosphere of war-panic in China. Air raid shelters were
                    built on a massive scale. A CIA estimate of October 1969 placed the chances of a
                    Soviet effort to knock out China's nascent nuclear weapons factories at about 1
                    in 3. Meanwhile, ever since Khrushchev came on the scene, China had been
                    nervously observing U.S.-Soviet relations and was increasingly concerned that
                    China might face U.S.-Soviet collusion.</p>
                <p>It was against this background—plus the growing influence of Zhou En-lai and the
                    pragmatists—that President Nixon's initiative was realistically possible of
                    achieving success.</p>
                <p>Just a few observations on why the President took this extraordinary initiative
                    on China. Certainly it was out of line with the thinking of many in the
                    Republican Party. It also involved a lot of risks—risks that secret preparations
                    might leak to the press, risks that the highly publicized summit meeting might
                    fail, risks of bad reactions in Japan, Korea, Taiwan or elsewhere. Moreover, he
                    was undertaking this trip at a time when the war in Vietnam was raging and when
                    the U.S. was suffering heavy casualties at the hands of an enemy supported by
                    Peking. Finally, his approach to China could be seen as a bit premature. Why not
                    wait until Mao passed from the scene—which seemed fairly imminent?</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>The very fact that the President took all these risks underlines the great
                    importance he attached to a U.S.-China rapprochement. As he said to me on one
                    occasion: “We simply cannot go on indefinitely in a hostile relationship with
                    one-quarter of mankind, especially as the PRC grows in military power.” There
                    was a need to move promptly at a time when the Chinese leaders were fearful of a
                    Soviet attack and when we could not allow the Soviet Union to take Sino-U.S.
                    hostility for granted in its policy calculations.</p>
                <p>The President also had sound internal political reasons for his China initiative
                    which was widely popular in the U.S., especially in academic, press and other
                    circles critical of our role in the long, bloody, fruitless war in Vietnam. For
                    many months, China took the headlines away from Vietnam. It cast U.S. foreign
                    policy in a positive light during a critical year for the Nixon
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>It must be remembered that President Nixon also had a strong sense of the mark he
                    would leave on history. That was evident from my first meeting with him in
                    Jakarta, with all his note-taking and tape-recording of conversations.</p>
                <p>China's affirmative response to Nixon's initiatives related overwhelmingly to its
                    fears of Soviet aggressive intentions and of possible Soviet-U.S. collusion
                    against China. But other factors were also undoubtedly involved. One of them was
                    the perceived advantage to Peking in having closer ties between Peking,
                    Washington and Tokyo, both in economic terms and in terms of better ensuring
                    that Japan's military capabilities would remain limited and confined to Japan's
                    self-defense through its defense ties with the United States. This point came
                    through to me loud and clear in a conversation with a top Chinese official in
                    Peking during the Nixon visit. The Chinese have long memories, and surely one of
                    the most painful of these memories is Japan's harsh occupation of North China
                    and its half-century colonization of Taiwan.</p>
                <p>President Nixon failed to recognize Japanese sensitivities in the sudden
                    announcement of his trip to China. For years the Japanese had followed the
                    American lead on China policy, even though they were anxious to get into the
                    Chinese market through early recognition of the Peking government. It had been
                    the nightmare of at least one Japanese prime minister that he would wake up one
                    morning to find the Americans in Peking and the Japanese left in the lurch. It
                    would have been possible to soften the blow to Prime Minister Sato and his
                    government had President Nixon sent a personal emissary like Ambassador U.
                    Alexis Johnson, who was well known and trusted in Japan, to explain the
                    President's initiative at least a day in advance of its announcement. This would
                    have given the Japanese government time to ready its public response, while
                    underlining our respect for Japan's special interests in this important
                    strategic move. I sensed that both Nixon and Kissinger compared the Japanese
                    leadership unfavorably with the Chinese, seeing the Japanese as preoccupied with
                    economic issues while the Chinese leaders thought in Nixon-Kissinger global
                    strategic terms. It was not until Nixon returned to Washington from China that I
                    learned that his obsession with keeping his China initiative secret was not, as
                    alleged by Nixon, out of consideration for the wishes of the Chinese but for his
                    own.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Some time after the President returned from Peking, I suggested through
                    Under-Secretary Alex Johnson and Henry Kissinger that President and Mrs. Nixon
                    might show their respect for Japan (and make amends for the Nixon shocks) by
                    flying to Alaska to greet Their Imperial Majesties, the Emperor and Empress of
                    Japan, who were stopping over at Anchorage for refueling en route by polar
                    flight to Europe. This was the first time in history that any reigning monarch
                    of Japan was to set foot on foreign soil—and it was to be American soil.
                    President Nixon took warmly to the idea (which he probably assumed was
                    Kissinger's) and Japanese reactions were highly favorable.</p>
                <p>A black mark in the President's China trip was the shabby way he treated his old
                    friend and loyal supporter, Secretary of State William Rogers. American
                    presidents in recent memory have had a tendency to rely considerably more on
                    White House Staff than on government departments, but in Nixon's case it was
                    carried to extremes, abetted in large part by the power-seeking Henry Kissinger
                    who played on President Nixon's longstanding distrust of the Foreign Service.
                    Ironically it was we in the Foreign Service dealing with Far Eastern affairs who
                    were the most enthusiastic supporters of the President's China policy. After
                    all, we had long striven for the goals reached during the Nixon
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>It was a curious coincidence that my 17 consecutive years (1956-1973) in dealing
                    with U.S. China policy should have started and ended by working for two
                    right-wing Republican lawyers—John Foster Dulles and Richard Nixon—both of whom
                    started out their public careers as anti-Communist zealots with simplistic
                    solutions to international issues, but both of whom ended their careers as
                    international statesmen. It remained for President Nixon to shake the extended
                    hand of Zhou En-lai in 1969, in dramatic contrast to Dulles' refusal to do so in
                    Geneva in 1954, a slight Zhou never forgot.</p>
                <p>U.S.-China relations had come a long way.</p>
