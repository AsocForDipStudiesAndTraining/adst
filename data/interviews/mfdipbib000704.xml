<p>The Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training Foreign Affairs Oral History Program Foreign Service Spouse Series</p>
<p>JANET LLOYD</p>
<p>Interviewed by: Jewell Fenzi</p>
<p>Initial interview date:  June 7, 1995</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q: This is Jewell Fenzi on Wednesday, June 7, 1995.  I am interviewing Janet Lloyd at my home in Washington, D.C.  This morning Janet and I will talk about her position as first director of the Family Liaison Office at the Department of State, 1978-1980.</hi>
</p>
<p>Please talk about your time at FLO, and what a break-through [the office] was.  I think it might be good, just for the record, to record all of the background, or at least some of the background, that preceded the founding of FLO, starting with Hope Meyers [Hope Meyers followed spouse issues at the Department of State from the mid-1970s until her death in 1991.  She chaired the Research Committee on Spouses that first recommended an ombudsman for spouses in the Department, a concept that ultimately resulted in the Family Liaison Office.].  She proposed an ombudsman for spouses.  This goes back to the Women's Action Organization (WAO) in the early '70s, and there were spouses in WAO, who were also employees, who felt that they had no voice in the Department.  And even the women [officers] themselves went to Mildred Marcy [Advisor, Office of Policy, USIA 1961-74], whose husband was chief of staff on Senator [William] Fulbright's Foreign Relations Committee, and had her introduce them to [Deputy Under Secretary of State for Management William B.] Macomber so that they could be heard on the seventh floor. [Offices of the Secretary of State.]</p>
<p>Then Hope Meyers moved into the Women's Action Organization rather tangentially through what I believe she called, the Committee on Research for Spouses.  There was no other organization — AAFSW [Association of American Foreign Service Women] of course wouldn't touch something called “Women's Action Organization”.  So Hope was in an interesting situation: she was vice president of AAFSW but really working with the other group.  Cynthia Chard came into that eventually, perhaps not until the [AAFSW] Forum, which was what led to FLO, and that meeting I recall very well occurred on a Saturday morning in November 1976.  Did you go to that?</p>
<p>LLOYD:  No.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Nor did I because I had to look at this house.  Then I felt that since I wasn't in on that effort at the beginning, I wouldn't try to catch up and become involved in it.  But that was in essence the background to what led to FLO.  And then I have in the files interviews with Lesley Dorman, Margaret Sullivan, Cynthia Chard, Jean Vance, Stephanie Kinney [Foreign Service wives actively involved in founding FLO.  Lesley Dorman, as president of AAFSW, marshaled the spouse forces that negotiated and lobbied for the office.], as well as with Hope — all the interviews that lead us up to how FLO came into being.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  It's a good thing you have [this record] of that early period because I was not involved in it and really don't know a great deal about it — I knew Hope Meyers reasonably well when she continued to come to meetings in the early days just before and after FLO was born.  I knew her, and about what you've just mentioned, but I was getting a Masters in that period, and with four children I was really flat out not involved with that situation.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Probably just as well, really — I think anyone involved probably would not have been chosen as the first director.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I think that's probably true.  And of course it was sort of felicitous from my point of view — I was working for the Foreign Service Education and Counseling Center, which is how I then came in contact with all these people and with the movement and read the Forum report for the first time.  I mean, I enjoyed that job SO muc(she laughs)  I think it was such an important time in the history of the Foreign Service.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Absolutely.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  — and women in the Foreign Service.  But I just feel it was through destiny: I was just close enough but far enough away, and had the counseling credentials which they really wanted.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And needed at that point.  What were you doing with the Education group?  Was that still Clark Slade then, or Bernice Munsey, or ... ?</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  It had been Clark Slade.  It was physically located in the AFSA [American Foreign Service Association] building across the street from the State Department.  Actually the two organizations were quite at odds.  (laughter)</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, I remember this, and I don't think Susan McClintock [Now Susan Clough Wyatt, first personnel officer/employment counselor at FLO.] put that on her tape but there was some friction?(they clarify that Munsey was later one of FLO's educational counselors, and transferred eventually to State)  She was not a Foreign Service spouse, actually, but obviously was very well versed in educational matters.</hi>
</p>
<p>What was the conflict between AFSA and the Education group?</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I think some of it was personalities and the rest of it wa(laughing)  just sort of “the women.”  They were a very male-oriented group when I first knew them.  I'm sure it's not true now because I know Don Norland [DonalR. Norland, former AEP to Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland 1976, and Chad, 1979] is doing things.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Don Norland's wife Pat has been very helpful with the oral history; she recently interviewed Donna Edmondson (spouse of former AEP to South Africa).</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  To finish with the FSECC [Foreign Service Education and Counseling Center] it was run by Clark Slade, and his attitude was also sort of “the women.”  When he left, a committee was formed — I don't remember exactly the circumstances of his leaving — which then selected Bernice Munsey, and I recall that committee consisted of Donna Hartman, Marilyn Holmes [Hartman was spouse of the assistant secretary of state for European affairs, 1973; Holmes was subsequently a FLO director] — again this is hearsay, I wasn't around — and some others I'm sure, and Bernice was chosen because they wanted an outsider, I think, a non-Foreign Service spouse at that point.  She set up a very good office, helping and advising — I think you had to pay something for this service but not very much.  It used to be subsidized.  That was a really going concern.</p>
<p>When FLO was finally agreed to, it became obvious that an office like that should in fact be placed in a FLO office, so it was, later on.  Bernice was involved in that and certainly deserves credit for it.  And let me not forget Pat Squire — she was there (at the Education and Counseling Center) when I first went there, she's the one who sort of broke me into my job, I sort of took over from her what she'd been doing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And she was going to interview someone else who had been involved in the FSECC.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  That was a piece of what eventually became a piece of the FLO office.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So you had your counseling experience, and you had your degree, and those were the two principal components of your application?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
<p>LLOYD:  Right.  I finished my work for the degree in March or May of 1977 and went to work for the Foreign Service Education and Counseling Center in the fall, so it was actually a short time before the FLO office was agreed to by Secretary of State Cyrus Vance.  Everything happened very quickly — once the right people were aboard with the idea, it went extremely quickly.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And it's interesting that Joan Wilson was at OBC and Stephanie [Kinney] [Wilson and Kinney were also Vassar graduates] was in the DG's [Director General of the Foreign Service] office.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  An amazing constellation of the right people in the right place all working together.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  At the right time.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  And they did.  It was very exciting.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And you started with Mette Beecroft [first deputy director of FLO], two of you?</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I started the office on March 1st, 1978, and I began working about the 3rd or 4th of January, I guess I was selected around January 4th, and I worked for two months while they got my clearance and the rest of it; setting me up physically, basically.  And that's an interesting story, just in itself.  (she laughs)</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Why don't you start with that.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Well, then we debated, Ben Read [Benjamin Huger Read, Under Secretary of State for Management, 1977] — Cyrus Vance was not involved in the day-to-day events — Ben Read was, and so was Harry Barnes [Harry George Barnes, Jr., Director General of the Foreign Service, 1977]; those were the two principals, and of course we had Stephanie Kinney, who was whatever she was, very close, a special assistant of some sort to Harry Barnes.  So she was able to kind of keep it all moving.  Ben Read and Stephanie and I discussed this.  We wanted to pick an office that would be very close to the entrance one way or another, because the whole psychological effect of the State Department rather intimidated many wives, so it had to be made easy for them.  The C Street [diplomatic] entrance appeared to be the right area, and if you recall on the right you've got the housing office, and the medical division (MED).People tended to come in there anyway, so the obvious offices were immediately to the left of the front door.  Well, the Secret Service was in there at the time but then Management decided that would probably be a good place for us to be located.</p>
<pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
<p>So I went around, talked to various people about the furnishings, and how the partitions would be moved, how big the office would be, and it all seemed to be running very smoothly.  In those days I was carrying a huge briefcase filled with samples of materials, briefings, telegrams — the whole schmeer of an office in my briefcase.  Wingate, my husband, was working at the State Department and he came down there one day and knocked on the door, from the sound obviously something was going on inside.  I'd been given a date when the office would be vacated and ours could open.  My husband sai[raising her voice as though talking through a door], “When is this going to be finished, when are you moving?”  And a Secret Service officer opened the door and said, “We're not moving!” and slammed the door in his face, would you believe it.  So I had to go back to Ben Read.  I think there must have been a good deal of behind-the-scenes pressure, but we did get those offices — where FLO still is located.  They've expanded, as they should, because they're important to the Department, and it was the ideal location.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You started with — what?  One or two or three rooms?</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Yes; two, really.  We moved partitions a bit as time went by; an area now closed was originally an open hall.  Since the very beginning a couple of offices, which I got, plus a coat check area have all been enclosed and used for FLO offices.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That's a testimony of FLO's success, that it was able to expand itself.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Well, I think gradually the need became clear and the usefulness to everybody became clear.  Joan Scott, our secretary, who had worked for Nat Davis, our ambassador to Switzerland, and Mrs. Davis, whom I don't know, telephoned Lesley Dorman to say “I have just the ideal secretary for you .”  Meanwhile I had interviewed a number of secretaries, none of whom looked right.  We needed somebody who would be welcoming, who would be in favor of an office of this kind, which is not always true of a single female from the secretarial staff, and I was quite depressed about that because I really needed someone on the telephone and in the front office who would be welcoming.  Anyway, Joan Scott turned up on the recommendation of the Davises and was just made for the job, she's wonderful.  Mette Beecroft was chosen by our selection committee for the deputy director position, which she fulfilled fantastically — a very tightly, well organized, research-oriented, detail-oriented Ph.D., a nice woman who could combine being very careful, which we had to be in the Department, particularly in the beginning, becaus(she laughs)  they were looking for us to make mistakes, with an ability to work very well with people.  So she was fabulous.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Of course that was my next question:  Were they really waiting for you to make mistakes, or was it just a matter of patting the ladies on the head.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I've thought about that a lot, whether there was open hostility.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I think there probably was.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Frankly, I was so busy.  When I got that job I had no idea what I was getting into.  Every waking moment was filled with meetings, decisions, issues and whatnot, I don't think I had much time to observe whether there was much hostility. What I would probably categorize it now as is a very heavy dose of skepticism.  I don't think anybody thought the office would work, therefore perhaps they weren't terribly threatened by it.  They just thought of it as some little pet project of Vance's and Read's, and the [Capitol] Hill's because it was very much behind this idea, and it would just go away over time.  So I think I was maybe not taken terribly seriously in the beginning by some people.  On the other hand, it was just waiting to be there, because even before the office opened, it was deluged with counseling calls, medical issues, divorce a very large issue of course.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Because “No fault” had just come in, hadn't it.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Yes.  Well, also for years the women who'd had divorces had been unable to get the Department to respond even to the question what they were legally entitled to.  For example, you had, and I presume still do, the right within a year of divorce to continue Foreign Service insurance but you have to sign up for that within the year at the rate that you have been paying in the past.  If you don't know that, and suddenly find yourself without any money, you might not sign up and then if you want to later, as an older, new applicant, you can't afford to.  So there were a myriad of legal issues that needed to be clarified, put in print, and offered to divorcing women seeking this help.  So, fairly rapidly they began to realize there really was a place for this.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were you personally aware of this need before you took over?  You were obviously aware of the needs of the children and education but were you aware of this other need?</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I wasn't aware of all the needs — I mean, it really became just a focus of so many things that were rumbling around overseas and here, that had been for years.  But I have to say, Jewell, that I was a very dissatisfied Foreign Service wife, particularly in Portugal, my most recent post.  I had just had it with what I call “the derivative role”(she laughs)  — you know, going to these cocktail parties, standing up for hours with my back aching, talking to people who didn't really want to talk to me, they were there to converse with their contacts in the embassy.  It all seemed like a false facade for me.</p>
<pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
<p>It took me a while to crystallize why I was so angry about doing that, but what really brought it to the fore was that I was by then raising three teenagers who were acting rather badly in Portugal: the education was not adequate for them, the social milieu was bad in that one could buy drugs in a drugstore, there were a lot of drugs around.  I'm not saying they couldn't probably have done the same things back here, and perhaps they would have, but from my point of view there wasn't enough peer pressure or adult, faculty pressure to support the sort of values that we believed in: I could see that the children were really going down the tube rapidly.</p>
<p>So, with all of that I came back to the United States and sai(she laughs)  “You know, this career is very questionable for me as the wife, anyway.  I can see it for the officer, male or female, it's a very exciting, wonderful life, and I've certainly had some very good times.”  That's not what I'm talking about.  It's the fact that I was tired of not doing something on my own.</p>
<p>And so that's why I went back to school.  I had a hard time getting back into school because my college record had not been so very good.  They took me on probation in the beginning, for a Masters degree, but after I got A pluses for a while they took me on.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  “New motivation?”(both laugh)</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Right!  And I absolutely loved it, I went to GW [George Washington University] and I met a whole lot of women my age who had interesting thoughts about what it's like to be a middle-aged woman.  My whole life changed at that point.  So, yes, I was certainly aware of some of the anger and some of the dissatisfaction of some Foreign Service wives, maybe not all, but who probably were not fully aware just how useful that office was going to turn out to be.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  If I could dwell for a moment on the “false facade,” that was the thing that bothered me for 30 years.  There seemed to be no substance to these relationships.  Because even though you got along very well with someone in Rabat, the minute they heard that you were going to be transferred to Cura�ao, that was it.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  They were looking at your successor.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Right.  And yet, time and time and time again on these tapes, women will say,  [exuberant tone of voice]  “Oh, we had such good friends... we had such good friends there.”  Was there some shortcoming on my part, or did I sense something that they didn't sense?  That was the thing that bothered me, and it bothered my children, too.  They were perceptive enough to see what they called the hypocrisy of diplomatic life.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
<p>LLOYD:  You probably have very “straight” children like you and Guido, an(laughing)  we do too.  I think they see those things and are not afraid to say so.  About the friend issue, I have very few friends left from foreign countries.  What I did make, and I'm sure you did too, is a few very close Foreign Service friends; very, very close, and they're still friends today.  But on the country you were living in, those did tend to fade when you left.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In a case like Sierra Leone, for example, very close friends and that was over 30 years ago.  Becaus(she laughs)  we survived it together!</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Exactly.  You took care of each other's children; there's a lot of that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But to get back to the 70s, there again it was just the right time for you too, things were happening.  Everything crystallized.  It was meant to be, obviously.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I think so.  That's the way it felt for me.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And that's when I began resenting having to go abroad.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I don't think I was as prepared to go abroad again after that, really.  Then I would have had to leave the older children behind.  I think my sort of grope into the late 70s or whatever that was, that period, really began with [Betty Friedan's] The Feminist Mystique.  It had a profound effect on me when I read it, and I continued to read feminist literature.  I don't consider myself a feminist at all but I do believ(laughing)  that women are people — I got to not feel like a person in the Foreign Service.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I've been doing feminist reading — believe it or not, at the Townshend Library, which is just down the mountain from us in Vermont.  Its current library director's a zero but the woman before was a great feminist, so there is a lot of feminist literature.  While Guido is either cutting down trees, or contemplating cutting down trees which is usually the case these days, I'm reading Susan Brownmuller, Kate Millett, Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, and I have learned all of that since I retired from the Service, because we were out for 24 of 30 years.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  And those books were not available over there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, not overseas.  So I think everything was right for you.  And then the FLO office was set up and you had Mette, you had Joan Scott.  What was the first big issue that you took on?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
<p>LLOYD:  (after a pause)  There were a whole bunch of issues that were parallel for a long time.  I think probably the divorced-spouse issue came in very strongly from the beginning.  Another area that I became very involved in was the whole setting up of the overseas offices, the CLOs [Community Liaison Offices, but they weren't called that at the time.  By the time the Office opened, in March, there were already I believe three CLOs that were operating overseas on their own which had been established by volunteers:  Bangkok, set up by Molly Whitehouse [Late spouse of Charles S. Whitehouse, AEP to Thailand, 1975], Rome, set up by Marilyn Holmes, and in Kuala Lumpur, I'm not sure who set that one up.  Those three were already operating and there were lots of others that were asking for a service of this kind.  So just from a management point of view, we had to figure out how to do that, what sort of positions to make available to these people, what to pay them, how to hire them — there was a whole infrastructure required to do that and I spent a lot of time on that; Mette spent much more time on the divorce issue.  There was a lot of debate about two months after the Office opened, a whole bunch of groups such as — I think it was the WAO, the Women's Action group, wasn't that a State Department group?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  They're not actually all State.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  That was the group I think who objected to the name of the office, they did not think it should be called the Family Liaison Office.  So Ben [Read] and I went over a whole bunch of...we came up with a number of different names.  Finally it was agree that it was primarily a family liaison office.  He had wanted that name because it had name recognition on the Hill — it took me a while to realize there are always other agendas when you're working with anybody, that was an agenda.  So it stayed that in Washington but we all agreed obviously that it would serve the whole community here but also overseas with the name “CLO” ayou know it now.  So I spent a lot of time on that.</p>
<p>The other big issue of course was jobs and the issue of the skills bank, developing jobs overseas and also I guess a little bit back here.  That took a lot of time.  Another parallel issue was the whole question of was it possible to have bilateral agreements with other nations so that we could work in each other's countries.  Of course in the beginning it was “absolutely not” because you'd lose your diplomatic immunity and “we would never allow you to go overseas,” this and that, “what would we ever do if you were picked up by the police,” et cetera.  Again, it required research, and although it's not my favorite thing to do I spent a lot of time reading the FAMS [Foreign Affairs Manuals] or finding somebody way down in the bowels of the personnel department whose expertise was on G-4 and G-5, diplomatic ratings, et cetera and what privileges they did or didn't have, or what would happen if you crossed the line or had a job or what would you give up.  Very minute stuff.  But unless you can get your hands on the facts in the Department, you might as well forget it.  S(laughing)  I had to discipline myself and do a fair amount of that.</p>
<pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
<p>But it worked, as you know, because we do have a lot of bilateral agreements now.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And they keep increasing.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  They keep increasinAnother thing: we met constantly in groups with other embassy wives.  The women's movement was perhaps a little further along in this country but it was going in all countries, and very high-level people would come into my office to see what we were doing, from countries like Sweden I remember particularly, Canada.  Our own ambassadors used to come back just to find out what we were doing.</p>
<p>What the FLO really did was just what they said it should do and then I'll take an aside there to say that I re-read the Forum report about every week during the time I was in that jo(she laughs)  to be sure we were on track.  Because I think it's one of the most brilliant documents that was ever put together, by people who, incredibly, had the vision to see what this Office could do, and it proceeded to draw all of the things — but the point was it was a clearinghouse, people came in with things that might appear to be way out in left field vis-a-vis the Office but it was a place where information passed.  I could put people in touch with other people.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In a way I regret that I didn't go to that first meeting, because I did go to the most recent conference in Silver Spring and I did leave before they broke up in groups to decide what to do because I felt that as a retired person I really shouldn't have an input.  From what you read about that first Forum meeting, there were a lot of angry women who stood up and spoke out, and I felt this meeting was really very tepid.  I came away thinking, “Have we really made that much progress?” or “Have we made enough progress so that these women aren't as angry as we were about 18 years ago?”</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I was surprised at that recent meeting too.  There are still a big core of women out there who I think are angry about the past, and there isn't much you can do.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  There's no point in being angry about the past.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I felt very sad after that meeting, really, for that reason, because I could see that there was a core of women who were dissatisfied, and what they need to do and I suppose are doing is find something now and move on with it.  I don't think the '72 directive issue will ever be solved because I think the Foreign Service women's role is so large that there's no way you can write anything that will cover the interests and abilities of all those people.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That's exactly what Naomi Mathews said in 1971.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
<p>LLOYD:  She is a smart lady.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  She was AAFSW president at the time and those were exactly her words.  Of course one thing that all these interviews have shown is how diverse we really are.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Tremendously talented group of people.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In very different ways.  And to have that talent be unused, under-utilized overseas.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  We never get any credit for it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And now no credit at all.  I mean, it sounds archaic that we were delighted to be in our husband's efficiency report in the 60s but that's all we had.  So when that was taken away, I think that was more important to the women than the Department realized.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I guess it was.  I have to make an admission on that particular issue.  I never knew I was being rated, my husband never told me about that.  So when we lost that — !  (outburst of laughter)</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I can't remember.  I must have known.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  You probably did.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I'm not sure, though, because when [FS Spouse Oral History interviewer] Pat Barbiinterviewed Marlene Eagleburger, Marlene said, “That did not stop in 1972, we were taken out of our husband's report in 1968 or '69.” I mentioned that to my husband and he said, “That's right.”He consulted some of his old reports and there I was in 1971.  But we had a crazy consul general then, and Guido said, “You shouldn't have been mentioned, but nobody could tell the CG that you didn't belong in there, so he went ahead and wrote it”.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  He probably wanted to say wonderful things about you.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  (hooting)  That “she sets a wonderful table” that “her children are good ambassadors, good examples of American youth.”  Reading it today, I thought, “How dare that man pass judgment on me and my children!”  Because he really was nuts.  He saw communists behind every divi-divi tree in Cura�ao.  But women's issues were part of FLO.</hi>
</p>
<p>Now, Cynthia Chard insists that the skills bank was part of the congressional rationale for the setting up of FLO and that she has the legislation to prove it.  Did you feel that the skills bank was something ...</p>
<p>LLOYD:  A lot of Cynthia's involvement in the skills bank issue happened before I came on the scene, so I'm not sure — I suspect she may be right.  I know that she was very involved with [Senator Joseph] Biden [D.-Del.] on the Hill.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And [Senator George] McGovern [D.-S. Dakota].</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  That I didn't know.  All I can give you is my impressions.  I think she was up on the Hill a lot talking to people and speaking for this concept, which was an excellent concept, and that was the thing the Hill was very familiar with probably before they understood the actual concept of the whole FLO office.  She may well be absolutely right about that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And she was sent up by WAO.  They were her introduction to the Hill.  And there she was, little slip of a thing, 30, and she believed that she's the first spouse to testify in person.  The spouses used to send other people up.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Lesley [Dorman] would know about that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I think that was even before Lesley.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  She was deeply involved before the FLO</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It seems to me that you had to do something with the skills bank if that was the case right at first.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
<p>LLOYD:  I think the intention was to do something with the idea, certainly, and we did, fairly soon, it would take a while, there was so much going on.  Including individual counseling cases — I don't know whether I mentioned that as part of what came in.  I was already carrying a few cases from the Educational Counseling Service that I couldn't let go — and that type then proceeded to come into FLO.  I spent a fair amount of time on just plain counseling too — I don't mean counseling in terms of sitting down and exploring, say, somebody's rationales but if it was a divorce case, putting them in touch with others — with lawyers, people in the retirement area of the medical division, and so on, whatever was required.  That came up for me a little bit later than the first six weeks.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And then evacuation came up some time in there?</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  That didn't really happen until the second year when the massive...I think it was the first of the huge evacuations that took place because of Tehran.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And Betty Atherton [Spouse of Assistant Secretary of State for Near East and South East Asian Affairs, 1974, and of AEP to Egypt, 1979, and instrumental in establishing the mental health program at State] that was in her competent hands.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  She was a volunteer, very active.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But she got space for that.  And then did you move into that space?</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Yes, that's when we began to move down into her office.  Inching down the hall.  She originally went and badgered NEA [Near East and Asia] until she got that space, and then once evacuation slowed down a bit, then we needed a place where the educational counselor could have a library and interview, so maybe Bernice or whoever was doing it moved in there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I forget who else was there.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  There's a lot more there now.  We went from me to a secretary to Mette to Susan McClintock.  They have a whole lot of others.  Somebody manages just the CLO program in there now.  I think there are one or two other jobs, may 10 or 11 — I go there occasionally but not often enough to tell you exactly.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, definitely the need for it was there and was proved with you.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
<p>LLOYD:  And I think the Department came to be very grateful for the program.  I think they really came to understand it was not just a bunch — the Department had a picture of really angry women.  I don't know whether Hope Meyers was an angry woman or not, I didn't know her that well.  But the question that those early women left was of extreme anger and I think the Department was very threatened by that.</p>
<p>One of the things I worked hard on — you know, you can't be too conciliatory or they roll right over you — was to sort of dispel that image and to try to create an atmosphere where we could exchange ideas.  And it worked eventually.  And of course I have to admit that there's no way this program would ever have got off the ground if we hadn't had the constellation of Ben Read, Harry Barnes, and Cyrus Vance.  And another issue — and you may not be ready for this, but I would like to dwell on it for just a moment — was what became to be known as “the brown bag luncheon group,” because the(laughing)also had profound effect on keeping high visibility and success of the office.  Do you want to talk about that?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes I do, for a number of reasons and after you've talked about it I'll tell you what they are.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  This was a group of women who came together on a monthly basis and it became more and more formalized as we went along.  It sort of started off very ad hoc with the FLO staff and Joan Wilson from the Overseas Briefing Center, Stephanie [Kinney].  It was really a small group in the beginning but little by little we added — I'm afraid of leaving people out — it always was a core of FLO and the Overseas Briefing Center, which later of course was [staffed by] Barbara Hoganson and Fanchon Silberstein. The staff changed a little bit but those two offices plus Betty Atherton, Jean Newsom, Gay Vance, and believe it or not, this is 1995 and Gay Vance still comes down from New York to have lunch with all of us and we get together — Nancy Hamilton, Lesley, Jean Newsom comes up from Charlottesville, Betty Atherton, Stephanie who's not in the country at the moment, but the group anyway.  It grew to be a large group and it wasn't always exactly the same people, but Nan Read of course came, somebody Barnes, I don't remember her first name, was never interested in being involved in any women's issues, she never was part of that at all.  She's an artist and that's what she wanted to do.</p>
<p>So anyway that group was very useful.  And also — who was the other person, he was on the Hill — Doug Bennett.  He was the congressional liaison at the time. So it was a wonderful group of women who had the ear of their husbands and so information flowed freely, we would discuss issues, which things needed to be moved ahead and in what manner, including as I've already said contacts on the Hill, et cetera et cetera.  So that was a very powerful lobbying group for the FLO office.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  We were just saying that in a way — this is what Hope Meyers said — “in a way, everything was changed and yet in a way nothing is.”</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
<p>LLOYD:  And the reason for that, essentially, is many of these problems are just endemic to a mobile life style.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Right, and they will never be “solved.”  Getting back to Hope, I don't think she was — how shall I say — actively angry; she was much too intelligent a woman not to realize that you weren't going to get anywhere with active anger.  And she could conceptualize beautifully, but she also unfortunately sort of met people head-on.  It wasn't anger so much as just a lack of administrative savvy, or interest — she wasn't really interested in administrative work, so she didn't realize its importance.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  She seemed quite single minded from the little bit I saw of her.  I went to her funeral just because I had known her a little bit and it was wonderful to see all those people there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Hundreds.  I was amazed.  LLOYD:  She obviously touched a lot of people during that time.</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  She made a tape for me the week before she died, to talk about the Research Committee for Spouses, in which she had all of the ideas that the Forum meeting took off on.  And Lesley and a lot of others went to meetings at her house but for lack of administration, the meetings never went anywhere.</hi>
</p>
<p>I found that out very quickly, too, with this organization (oral history program), that I'd leave a meeting, come home and ask myself, “Who's doing what, now that we've had this meeting?”  She was brilliantly conceptualizing and never assigning any tasks.  And she'd been interested in spouse oral history since 1972 and couldn't convince Joan Wilson to do anything about it at OBC, because Joan had I think weightier, more important problems on her mind and things that she wanted to do at OBC.</p>
<p>But let's get back to FLO:  How closely did you work with OBC?</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Very, very closely.  I just loved and to this day love and admire Joan Wilson.  You can hardly imagine how gracious she was to me, because I think a lot of people felt that she'd been doing this for years with no recognition and then suddenly this great hoopla when the FLO office was established.  She could have been resentful about that but she just was so nice, she helped me in every way she could, we worked together on workshops that would answer the needs that were clearly being articulated in our office.  There was just a wonderful relationship; we worked very closely together.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I haven't read any of your reports but because I researched OBC looking for [former Family Workshop director] Dorothy Stansbury's file, which I never found, I did read some of Joan's.  And I think Joan Wilson must have one of the finest minds I've run across in the Foreign Service, really.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  How interesting!</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Her prose is direct but thoughtful, clear, well thought out.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  She's a very directed person in (she laughs)  kind of gentle way.  She doesn't “come at you” at all but she knows what's important — she has good values.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But you must have had some of those same qualities — must have brought some of the same qualities to the office.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I don't know.  But she was a charmer to deal with, she really was.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And then Stephanie was in such a lovely spot because here she was able to be on the inside and promote spouse issues.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Stephanie is a very capable, very articulate human being.  And because she was a little bit younger she was very skillful at bridging her and Cynthia's generation and I was sort of in the middle, with Lesley and Joan being a bit older.  But anyway she was able to work with all these different generations and pull up all together.</p>
<p>When you say that Hope Meyers didn't come up with assignments or whatever, to my mind comes the word “focus” and the one thing Stephanie was very, was focused.  And that Forum, of course, is one of the most focused pieces of prose that I have ever read.  It says it all, it's all there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  She essentially, wrote it, didn't she?</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I think she did.  Again, it was done while I was finishing that degree but I think she wrote it, and she's the one that conceptually understood what FLO had to do.  And then, you know, the marvelous fact was that there she was, next to Harry Barnes in Personnel and able to make it happen!  She led me around by the nose —  this is how you use the phone book, because I didn't know anything when I started there.  She did a very good job of coalescing the whole thing.</p>
<pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It might be very interesting for you to go over to the [AAFSW] office and read the [various] interviews.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I know hers would interest me because I like the way her mind, she's very, very brave.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Jean Vance's is nice, and Lesley is Lesley, and Margaret Sullivan, who is probably “still angry”.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  She certainly was.  I haven't seen her for a number of years.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I think she wisely just moved away from spouse issues and got writing jobs and went off....I was angry too but I didn't want to spend the rest of my life being angry at the Foreign Service.  So I thought, well, I'll look around and ...(End of tape)</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  You asked me how long I was in the FLO job.  The job description and the intention of the selection committee was that the head of FLO would be there for two years only.  They wanted the jobs in the Family Liaison Office to turn over every two years, bringing in people from overseas, so that there would be a fresh bath of overseas ideas and experience, which I truly do believe was a good idea.  So at the end of two years I did resign and they hired somebody else.</p>
<p>I believe now that people are allowed to stay for as long as five years.  I personally think that that's too long a time.  The reason they give is that it takes a while to learn a job, because it's a much bigger office now.  I'm sure that's true, however I question five, I think it's too long.  Maybe three would be more reasonable.</p>
<p>The other thing that concerns me a little bit about where FLO is now is that the Office was set up for very good reasons to be directly under M, under Management, and some time recently the FLO organizational chart was changed and now FLO reports directly to the Director General.  In other words, it's under the P part [Personnel] and does not report directly to M.  Automatically this is going to mean that FLO becomes a more bureaucratized office, which seems too bad.  I used to joke with my successor Marilyn Holmes about the fact that the FLO idea was a wonderful one and would work for a certain number of years but that eventually it would become bureaucratized, as everything does in the State Department, and at that time it should be abolished, and after a short time the ideas would bubble to the surface again and a brand-new office could be created.  (laughing)  We'll wait to see if that happens.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The reinventing of the wheel at State is very good!  So Marilyn was your immediate successor.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I think she's my direct successor — there was me and her and I guess Sheppie Abramowitz briefly, Marcia Curran, Maryann Minutillo.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Sue Parsons.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD: And Sue Parsons, of course, and she was very good, an AAFSW person, of course.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What else did you do during your years?</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I think I've pretty much described the areas of working.  By the time I left we had accomplished a lot of things, such as — we did have the Canadian bilateral agreement in place; others were well along and came in very fast after the initial one because the one with the Canadians set up the model which many of the other countries and we were able to emulate.</p>
<p>Some of the other things that I think are important were happening towards the end of my second year.  We had gotten the Foreign Service Institute to agree to training wives in consular affairs and in budget and fiscal matters; also, child-care was by then being offered to the new junior officers coming to Washington, so that their wives could partake in the junior officer training programs.  A lot had begun to take place at the Overseas Briefing Center and the Foreign Service Institute in general in training the wives for working in the missions abroad.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now, did you generate these ideas or did they come from outside?</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I doubt very much that I generated too many of them myself, although obviously being right at the center — it all synergizes, or whatever the word would be.  But there were so many people that were excited about what this office could do that I'm sure most of the others were given to me, and then in my position I was able to go to the people in the Department to say that this was an idea that maybe we could work on.  Because everything in the Department happens by getting a key person in many different departments who will clear off on an idea, then you take it to the head of Management and get them to say yes, this was a good idea.  And it goes.  And then the idea is actually acted upon.</p>
<p>So the job of being director of FLO is very much one of finding the right contact points, bringing those people together in meetings, agreeing on something and then presenting a memo to Management.  And that's how we got training [for spouses].</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So now they'll be presenting [new ideas] to Personnel.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I presume.  You'd have to ask how they actually do that now but yes, it would not be even taken directly to the head of Management.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It seems to me that they have unwittingly, if that's the case, put a layer between ...</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  They have put a layer between them, and I'm actually aware of issues where Personnel has put the kibosh on certain things which I feel were wrong but they have the final word now.  Or at least FLO agrees to their having the final word.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What were some of the things?</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I'm not sure that I want to get into that too much.  The idea of a CLO corps could easily be put into effective response; a good idea.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And that would take care ...</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  You may not know the answer, but how often does AAFSW meet with FLO nowadays.  Do you ever meet with them?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  When I have been at the office I try not to be there for board meetings, it's pretty tight quarters.  If I happen to go in on a board meeting day, I try to go in at the end, and Kendall [Montgomery, FLO director] has been leading those meetings.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Oh good, so there continues to be communication.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I think so.  Now, there is a board meeting today, whether she is at that or not I don't know.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I'm glad to know that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And I'm wondering how OBC and FLO are working together.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
<p>LLOYD:  I don't know now because of course it's [the National Foreign Affairs Training Center] way out there in Virginia — it used to be very easy just to jump on the [Department of State shuttle] bus and have lunch one place or the other or give a workshop or go to a workshop, but it's inevitably got to be more difficult now because of the geographical distance.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But they seem to be very well set up.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I have not been out to the new training center.  I went to the inauguration but I haven't seen the offices there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I didn't go to the inauguration because our oral history project tea was the same day.  We had already sent out invitations when they changed the date.  It was sort of fun because Lesley came rushing ove— “Oh it's such a busy day, lunch with Gay Vance, and —”  (laughter)  Actually, it added a little pizzazz to our tea because everyone breathlessly came in from the inauguration.</hi>
</p>
<p>I do think they seem to be very well organized and very much under control and I speak four times a year to the MQ-100 course and talk to the young wives. Not even necessary going out [abroad] but anyone who happens to be taking that course, and I speak to them for about an hour on how it used to be, and then Kendall or someone from FLO comes in and talks to them about how it is today.  And we do that as the end of the course — I think it's a week, no one can afford two weeks now.</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I'm sure a lot of things are being cut back.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, I think it's more that people feel they can't take two weeks and the young people, if they have children, can't afford the baby sitters to come for two weeks.  And that's an ideal place to have a child care center.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  And they don't have one?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I don't think so.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  When it was still in Rosslyn, I think they got a financial stipend for babysitting, which may not have covered it.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Originally it was [Cyrus] Vance, who used to be Secretary of the Army, who got the Ft. Meyer — I suppose it would work now, you could drop your child at Ft. Meyer and go on out.  The Center has vast lawns, and there has to be space.  They even have little cottages that they inherited, and one of those could be turned into a child care center.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  If I were involved in all that, it's surely an issue I would get on, because to get these young officers and their wives or husbands properly trained and all that is so important to the job they do.  It's money well spent to have a child-care center there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  We were at a French Embassy affair recently given for the departing French ambassador and his wife, and they came in at the very last and sat in the front, and she greeted everyone on the way down the aisle, he made a farewell speech, and I'm sure is a very fine diplomat, a very fine ambassador, a shrewd negotiator, a fine representative of his country.  He was a little stiff.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Is this Andreani.  I sat next to him at a dinner once and he was not easy to sit next to.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, who was the person who just absolutely ignited and sparked the evening?  Donatella, his wife.  She was the one who, as they came down the aisle shook hands, and during the intermissions of the musical at their center on Reservoir Road, and she was the one who was “working the room.”  She was the one whom everybody knew, she was the one who was going from this group to, with the air brush kisses on both cheeks.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Well, that's your idea of an ambassador's wife, isn't it really?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, but it made me realize, she was working.  We had a role and we played a role and the State Department to this day won't admit that spouses play a role as a support system.  [she relates the role Donatella played in giving the Oral History Project's book (Married To The Foreign Service), entree into the diplomatic corps]  I wish I could have videotaped her and then played it for everybody in the upper echelons of State to let them see what a woman really does.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Somehow she must be valued within her own culture for the role she plays, which is what we do not give.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  We don't, and she's Italian, she's not French; a career woman in her own right, so she knew who she was before she became an ambassador's wife, and I have a feeling she's not playing a role as an ambassador's wife, she is doing a job as a woman who realizes she has a career in her own right.  Because I believe she's an interpreter, linguist, accomplished woman really.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
<p>LLOYD:  It is their joint career, which of course it is.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I don't know if she gets any benefits or not but she is certainly the ideal they had in mind when you and I were Foreign Service wives.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I think the French culture values diplomats more than ours presently does, so that may in itself make a difference; for her, I mean.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You've kept in touch — do you see a great change in the attitude of the women in '78 and today vis-a-vis their role in the Service?</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  You're assuming that I know a lot of the younger wives, and I don't think I do, so I'm not sure I can answer that question.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I remember reading in the FLO report that the younger wives who had a certain amount of entertaining, a job that wasn't too demanding, and time with their families were the happiest.  The least happy as we all know are the ones whose husbands have gotten to the top, with great demands made on their time, with no compensation, no recognition.  And the women who came in looking for jobs in 1978, was it really career orientation or was it just something to do?</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I think there was some of both.  It would really only be the FLO office that could answer the question as to how satisfied they are with what they've done overseas.  But the very fact of Foreign Service life means you really cannot follow a profession, and the sooner you shape up and recognize that, I would say, (laughing)  the happier you're going to be.</p>
<p>If you're willing to work a budget and fiscal job in one place, and be the CLO in the next place, and you're comfortable with that and see that as also giving you flexibility with your children or traveling or older parents or whatever you may need time for, then you're going to be a very happy person.  But if you're going to resent the setback to your profession or career or advancement, it isn't going to work.  And I guess there are a fair number of women who stay in this country who have a strong professional interest because there's no way you can do that.</p>
<p>I don't think we'll solve these problems, basically.  I think FLO was successful in opening every possible avenue to make it easier, but it's not an issue that can be solved.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I think they realize that.  We didn't realize that at the time.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Yes, that may be true.</p>
<pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In the 70s we were looking for solutions, and I think they realize now that there is no solution.  So let's, you know, do the best we can with working with an inherently mobile career.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Well, it goes back to basically the initial issue, which was that little brochure, something “for married applicants”?  Remember that?  We rewrote it right away when we opened FLO, trying to explain just what we're talking about — that a career path is not an easy thing to do, and this is the way it is, and if you're joining the Foreign Service thinking you're going to continue your legal profession, it's not going to work.  But nobody ever reads ...  (she laughs)</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  They don't pay any attention.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I still think they don't read it very much, but it's not for lack of everybody telling them what it's would be like.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Another thing, it's the bind that it puts these women in.  Their husbands don't want to do anything else.  Time and time again the women say,”He doesn't want to do anything else.”  Now, if that isn't putting a guilt trip on a wife who because of her own career asks a husband to give u— as you said, we had a very exciting time, we, we did exciting things, we've done things that you only read about in Lindblad's special tours.  (laughing)</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I'm glad we did them when we did them, too — I don't think many of them are available any more, for many reasons.  We had good years.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, we really did.  And we could always return home by the most devious route possible, to see what we wanted to see en route.  Well, a lot of that's gone.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  It is gone.  And I think with terrorism at the level it is nowadays, there are an awful lot of places you simply wouldn't feel free to go.  I think of all the camping we did in Morocco, I'm not sure I'd feel terribly safe doing that any more.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And think about sending your children off alone on planes to school.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Hijacking and bombs and all sorts of things.  It's a very dangerous world now.  Different.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Maybe we shouldn't send families abroad.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I'd be interested to know what the rate of unaccompanied assignment is overseas at the moment.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I believe it's 60 percent.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I think that's terribly high.  On that basis you'd have to ask what is the divorce rate, too.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The FS divorce rate used to be 50 percent, that was years ago, and now the national average may have slipped down a bit from 50.  I think the national and the Foreign Service rates have come closer together now.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  And they used to say the divorce rate wasn't as high as we all assumed there was.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, I think it must have been very exciting to be in on what was really the — the militant women had started before.  They started in the early 70s but to be in on the positive progress that was made for spouses, right!  I mean you were the ground floor: that must have been very exciting.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  But, you know, when I think about it, I was out there one angry woman, not knowing that all this movement was taking place here in Washington.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I didn't know that either.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I think we were all little lonely islands thinking “something's wrong with me that I feel this way.”  So when this whole thing coalesced, suddenly we realized we weren't alon(she laughs)  and were we ever powerful!</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I think it was [FS spouse] Susanne Newberry who said she didn't know for five years that there had been the '72 directive, because she was out — I remember my husband bringing this airgram home to me.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  When mine brought it home to me too.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And I remember taking a look at it and saying, “Well, if it will work, fine.”</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Yes, I remember too, I feel I didn't fully take in the significance of it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I didn't either.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  But none of us did. (laughter)Q:  It was interesting too.  [Oral history interviewer]</p>
<p>Joan Bartlett who lives in Plymouth went to Martha's Vineyard to interview Bill Macomber, and I corresponded with Bill Milam, who was one of the drafters of the directive.  Also someone named Bill Salisbury from USIS, who had studied law — Milan hadn't — and the other drafter was Rick Williamson, who had also studied law.  A woman named Carol Pardon was an angry, angry, ardent feminist.</p>
<p>Those four young people decided our fate in drafting the directive.  They took it to Macomber who was responsive.  He said that the reason he had been so responsive to the WAO women was because they were the only ones who came into his office with smiles on their faces and said please.  (hearty laughter)</p>
<p>Of those people, three were divorced.  Carol Pardon was divorced early on.  Salisbury is the only one who stayed married.  Rick Williamson's wife, who was the adamant wife, who'd had a run-in with the women's group in Munich.  She had been doing some research work for her husband in the political section, which she thought was much more important than baking brownies for the ladies' bake sale, and said — quite rightly, I feel, “I don't have time, I'm doing something else, tell me how much the brownies will sell for and I'll give you the money.”They wouldn't take it.  No, they wanted her to bake.  This was in '69, before the directive.  So she was obviously pressuring Rick, who was one of the key people when the Secretary's open forum was addressing the issue.  She went on to be a successful officer but they divorced too.  So only one couple stayed together, and none of the wives were traditional spouses: the traditional spouse had no voice because AAFSW couldn't reach a consensus, so there was no voice either pro or con from AAFSW.</p>
<p>So I felt that our future was decided by people who really were not the right people to make the decisions.</p>
<p>LLOYD:  If that directive had never been written, how do you think it would have come out?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It would have all come to a head somewhere along the line.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
<p>LLOYD:  It would have happened incrementally.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Incrementally, but if so, possibly there would have been a niche left for the traditional spouse.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Of course, the equation of paying people for their work was added to the problem, so to speak.  It's a shame in a way that we have to value ourselves according to how we're paid but it's very American, that idea.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Don't you think now too, considering the cost of university education and the cost of housing unless you go out to Herndon or some distant suburb, I wonder how far a young officer's salary goes, if he does have two or three children.LLOYD:  I totally agree, I think it takes two salaries to live in a reasonably good fashion these days.</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Especially with education costs.  And a Foreign Service salary doesn't — I guess if you go abroad and have hardship pay and rent your house perhaps you can do it.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  During that time, but then that means you're driven to stay overseas forever.  I think it's a very tough life for so many reasons, I really do.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It really is.  And it is the most difficult thing that our children and I did, especially when Guido had gone ahead to the consulate in Cura�ao and I had to put our son in Deerfield Academy and our daughter in Bradford College and go off and leave them alone.  Now, they had been in boarding school before but their moving into American private schools with kids who hadn't been abroad et cetera, they said that was awfully hard for them.  And it was awfully hard for me.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  [recounts depression and breakdown of one of her daughters while at school in U.S. and separated from parents overseas]  I just kept saying, “Hang on, dear, we're coming next summer ... “ which we did but it was already too late by then.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was it separation from you or thinking that she was American and finding that she wasn't?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
<p>LLOYD:  All of the above.  What I have come to believe, having done a lot of training in this now too but I could still be wrong, I think that Foreign Service families tend to get too close, becausyou're everything to each other, and I think she was too dependent not only on us but on her siblings, at the same time that she was angry with all of us because she wanted to be at the age where she wanted to be autonomous and, you know, grow up.  So she had that conflict going on.  Then she came back here and nothing that she related to did anyone at the boarding school relate to.  She found she was incredibly lonely and didn't know what it was.  Now she's an attorney that goes to court, but she was an incredibly shy child to boot.</p>
<p>So, anyway, that happened and we came back and George had his problems at St. George's and Kakie had hers at Milton.  That's when I just said to my husband, “I don't care what happens, I'm not going overseas again, these children are falling apart” — had fallen apart by then.  So that was a great deal of my motivation to sort of try and figure out what had gone wrong in all of this.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  There again you took a negative factor in your life and made a very positive thing out of that.  And did your husband feel very strongly, I mean was he one of these people “wedded to the Foreign Service”?</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I think, because he adored his children as much as I do, he could see that something terrible was happening.  What caused the problem, who knows?  I mean maybe genetically — there could be a lot of different reasons, there are constellations of reasons, for things that happen to children.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But I remember happy little children in Rabat.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Then I came back and met all the other people whose children had done just the same things that mine had.  You'd be surprised how many people had very serious problems.  So that became an interest — talking to them, doing research on it, finding out more about it.  You asked about Wingate [husband].</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I think he could see we had a real problem obviously on his hands, but I will feel guilty as long as I live that he retired from the Foreign Service and made a trade for me and the children, and he did.  I hadn't gotten to the ultimatum stage yet but I had developed each year and I'd already had the FLO experience of course by then and I'd had a couple of other interesting jobs, and that's what I wanted to do.  And I did not want my fourth child subjected to what I then believed had not been too easy an existence for the other ones.</p>
<pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So what did [Wingate] do?</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  So he retired from the Foreign Service.  He then went to work for the ITT corporation and he has been working for them ever since.  That job had been held by an FSO before him, Sam De Palma.  He has been their international representative; they have a lot of questions that they have about their companies about trading overseas, and Wingate knows where to go to get the answers to various questions they have.  That's what he does.  And I think he has enjoyed it.  But, I think, leaving me and the children aside, he definitely would have stayed with the Foreign Service.  But, are you going to stay married?  You're going to have children, you have to make some compromises.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You are absolutely right.  And that of course is one of the big issues today.  But, by that time you really were career oriented.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I really was.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  A lot of today's young women, with graduate degrees, come into the Foreign Service very career oriented.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Do you think they understand what [lies ahead]?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Of course they don't.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Even though it is written and explained to them.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I have seen them in tears at FSI.  “I'm nothing.  I'm not a student, I'm not going to put Foreign Service wife [on a form].”  And I say, “Put Foreign Service wife.  Make it a career.”</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  It isn't given any value, either by the Department or by society.  It's a tough one...and it must be tougher for those women even than it was for us.  We still remembered when we were valued at least and I imagine they feel that they have never been valued or not being valued by the Department.  And by their own peer culture.  It's a tough world for them, it really must be.  Well, the State Department in general is undergoing such tremendous attack at the moment that one wonders where anybody will be.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  A young woman officer who comes to our Brazil luncheon group said that everybody is just hanging on and hoping for the best.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Aren't they glad they don't work for AID, or if they do they must really be trying to hang on.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Is there anything we've left unsaid about FLO.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I don't think so.  I mean I think we have covered basically the opening of the office and the general areas of operation for the first year or two. I don't know how you work this, but if you have further questions, you know when you look over it, I'd be happy to add an addendum.  I could talk probably for a week on the things we did but you know, how to organize it, who's interested, what are the areas of interest, I don't know.  So if there is anything missing...</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  A further interview with you, for instance could be if AAFSW wanted to address a certain issue, like FLO becoming too bureaucratic.  The value of listening to you and how you handled FLO in the glory days when there was not all the layered bureaucracy.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Life was easy for me.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The one thing you haven't addressed and I wouldn't expect you to is that time, and time and time again people have said that the reason FLO got off to such a successful start was because of the way you handled it.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Well, I am very flattered to even record that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You went in angry but you didn't confront the bureaucracy because you realized that you had to work with it.  So you worked with the men and you built up a network and you worked well with Stephanie [Kinney] and you worked well with Joan [Wilson, at OBC] and that wasn't all a one way street.  All of you were willing to give and take and work together.  You deserve a lot of credit.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Well, it was very clear we were dealing with Pat Hayes who was very opposed I think to the FLO being set up altogether and we were working with George Springsteen who was head of FSI again a male chauvinist of the first order, both perfectly nice people but just old world mind sets.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You were threatening their turf.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  I knew that, so I looked the scene over when I got in there, I said to myself, if we go at this in a too strong a way we are simply going to alienate everybody and these people have the potential to just turn down my phone calls, not meet with me, not cooperate with me, and they'll do it passive aggressively because then [the Department] might come to them and say you have to deal with her.  But unless I can get them to deal with me and see the legitimate commonality of our purpose here, this office is not going to accomplish what it was meant to do.  So I am certainly very pleased to hear that is the way it was viewed, I'm sure there was a fairly large contingent or some contingent who would have preferred that I went at it in a more aggressive way.  But I think I have already explained to you why I didn't feel that would work.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And I don't think that would have been your style.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  It wouldn't have been my style necessarily but also it wouldn't have worked.  I knew that.  And even dealing with Ben Read and Harry Barnes and Cyrus Vance, these gentlemen are gentlemen and you don't deal with them except in a gentlemanly fashion and they will give you the moon if you do it in a pleasant, positive approach and give them a rationale to which they can agree.  And then they will go along with you and they did.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  As Secretary Macomber said, they [women] were the only ones who smiled and said please.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  That upper echelon of the older Foreign Service people responded to that.  They were willing to talk about anything but they did not like to be threatened too much.  And of course my job was to threaten in many respects but there is threatening and there is threatening and it is pointless to do that.  I also recognized that I had to get their respect early on or everything was lost.  So I tried to run a very difficult line between being clear about what the purpose of the FLO office would be at the same time that negotiations were going on.  It's hard to explain, it was a very difficult road to thread.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did Wingate help you at all?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
<p>LLOYD:  Oh, yes.  He was wonderful.  He could have been — any husband could have been quite threatened by the hoopla that was made about the opening of the FLO and he is not like that.  He just thought it was wonderful, he understood where I was coming from, he understood where the office was coming from.  He did a tremendous amount to help me.  He knew all the principal players so he could advise me how to work with each of them.  I think the most important thing he did for me besides just support me was to show me how to use the phone book.  (laughter)  Because if you can't use the State Department phone book you can't communicate with anybody.  He explained all the different bureaus and how it was organized, and the organizational chart, and he was a tremendous help, he really was.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Because he had been in the Department long enough then to know how you had to work within the bureaucracy.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  Well, he had just I think finished working in MMO himself, so he knew Joan [M.] Clark [Director of Management Operations, 1977-79], Phyllis Bucsko, and all those people.  I forget when he changed, but he went to the Senior Seminar sometime early during my two years in FLO and that was fine too.  He was doing his thing and I was doing mine.  I think it's possible that some of the State Department people might have made him a little uncomfortable about my role.  But he wasn't around for them to do that.  But he was still advising me, so it worked out very nicely.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So he was a supportive spouse.</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  He was a very supportive spouse, he certainly was.  And I can't say that I always thought that he would be.  He has continued to be since that time.  But there was a time in the Foreign Service that I think he simply didn't understand my dissatisfaction with the role that I found myself more and more playing, that it brought nothing personally back to me.  As I call it the derivative role was not a happy one for me.  It took him a long time to understand.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I think there are a lot of men who are so caught up in that profession that they cannot understand why...</hi>
</p>
<p>LLOYD:  And their attitude is you have this nice house, you've got these servants, you're taking these wonderful trips.  Why should you complain!  (laughter)</p>
