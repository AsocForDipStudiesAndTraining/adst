                <p>1. From Vienna to Brooklyn and beyond.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's begin with personal background and the experiences
                        that led you to a career in the Foreign Service, and then, more or less
                        chronologically, go through your various assignments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I was born in Vienna in 1926, the son of Frederick Jaeger, a gifted art
                    Professor and rather successful Austrian painter who exhibited among other
                    galleries in Vienna's prestigious 'Sezession'. My mother Emilie was one of
                    Vienna's early self-made women, who had become business manager of a now
                    long-defunct shoe factory, a job to which she worked her way up through grit,
                    resilience and intelligence from very modest beginnings. She married my father
                    some time after his return from the Italian front in World War I where he had
                    been an artillery Lieutenant in the Austrian-Italian standoff in the Dolomites,
                    today's South Tirol.</p>
                <p>My parents were a warm, conscientious, caring people, who formed me and brought
                    me up in our modest but, by the standards of the time, comfortable and sunny
                    flat in Vienna's 14th District. During summers, when my father had over two
                    months' vacation - the happy lot of Viennese professors in those days! - we
                    packed up paints, easels, books and mountain boots and went off to Carinthia or
                    East Tirol - sometimes staying in local inns, sometimes in “Pensions” run by the
                    village priest: Idyllic months, full of long, happy days of walking in the hills
                    and mountains, swimming in ponds, or helping carry my father's painting gear -
                    in what was still a very unspoiled, isolated peasant world, much closer to the
                    19th than the 20th century. I clearly remember the excitement when a very
                    lofty-looking English family in a formidable motor car, probably a Rolls Royce,
                    came through Paternion in Carinthia one day in the late thirties, where we were
                    staying in the local inn, stirring up dust and scattering the chickens. They
                    spoke to me, patted me on the head and left me amazed at being confronted by
                    people from another world!</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I was a happy, secure and cheerful child - although an inveterate
                    reader and a good, perhaps too dutiful student - who, to cite only one example,
                    asked for and got a three volume set of Greek Mythology for his 10th birthday
                    present in 1936!</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Part of the motivation was that Austrian schools were highly competitive, and
                    academic success was the key to getting into Gymnasium and later into
                    University. For example, only eighty-some, out of a thousand applicants who
                    wanted to enter the Seipel Gymnasium in the year I applied, actually made the
                    cut, and, by the second year, only thirty-three were left! Even fewer normally
                    made it through to graduation. The unmistakable lesson was that it was important
                    to work hard, often memorizing and writing well into the night, if one didn't
                    want to take one's chances in a world with few safety nets. As my mother
                    insistently put it: “Remember, you are a Professor's son!”</p>
                <p>In fact, it turned out to be a much better education than contemporary pedagogues
                    might suspect. Memorizing Schiller's poems and pounding away at Latin grammar
                    instilled a penchant for precision in language, thinking, and logical analysis,
                    enormously helpful in later life in putting first things first and parsing
                    complex human and political equations.</p>
                <p>What's more, reading the classics, with their endless assertions of virtues and
                    vices, attending mandatory religion classes and regularly going to church led,
                    if not to lifelong faith, at least to a lifelong quest for meaning and the moral
                    imperatives which flow from it, human dignity and human rights. Moreover, the
                    sense of history instilled during those early years, however incorrectly and
                    badly taught, laid the groundwork for an almost instinctive understanding in
                    later years of the interrelating flows in time and space, which make up our
                    world's fast-shifting multi-dimensional continuum.</p>
                <p>It was all part of another time, not destined to last. There were clear
                    forewarnings, even for a child: My first came on a gray, cold evening in
                    February 1934, I was not yet quite eight, when my parents took me along to some
                    friends' house for a late afternoon 'Kafe' - I was to recite some poetry as part
                    of the entertainment - when, on our way, we were suddenly caught up in
                    machine-gun fire: Part of the fierce, long-brewing but unsuccessful Socialist
                    uprising against center-right Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss. This crisis was
                    followed in July by a Nazi putsch orchestrated in Berlin, during which Dollfuss
                    was assassinated. The anxieties and tensions all this generated between
                    Socialists, Austrian Nazis and the many caught between, was palpable even in the
                    village inn in Carinthia where we spent that summer where the question was no
                    longer whether the Nazis would have their way but when. Although Anschluss to
                    Hitler's Germany was averted for another four years by Dollfuss' successor, Kurt
                    von Schuschnigg, the handwriting was clearly on the wall.</p>
                <p>Looking back, I certainly did not fully grasp the seriousness of these events
                    even on the day, it was March 9, 1938, when, on returning home from Gymnasium, I
                    found my alarmed parents listening intently to Schuschnigg's abdication speech
                    on their tiny crystal radio set.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Only four days later, on March 13, standing on the sidewalk on Mariahilferstrasse
                    on my way home from Gymnasium, I watched the Germans march in cheered on by
                    ecstatic crowds: First long columns of tanks, trucks and troops, then Hitler
                    himself, followed by Goering in his bulging white Marshall's uniform, then the
                    rest of the top Nazis in Hitler's entourage, all driving by in swastika-flying
                    tops-down black staff cars on their way to the Hofburg, where Hitler was to make
                    his victory speech to hundreds of thousands jubilant Viennese!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: There were changes. Everyone started wearing little swastikas on their
                    lapels; red boxes appeared on street corners to display the front-pages of the
                    'Stuermer' (the Nazis' virulent propaganda publication) with their wildly
                    anti-Semitic headlines and caricatures of Jews with big ears and long noses; and
                    Hitler youth formations were organized in all schools. As a fairly normal
                    twelve-year old I secretly admired their shiny daggers, drums, marching and
                    singing - mostly the Horst Wessel Lied - but never thought of joining.</p>
                <p>Things changed in our Gymnasium as well. Our new history teacher and chief
                    indoctrinator was a man in a 'brown shirts' uniform, complete with black boots
                    and a swastika armband. I particularly remember his claim that the Germans had
                    always been a greater civilization than the Romans or the Greeks! Unfortunately,
                    he explained, they didn't leave archeological evidence behind because they built
                    everything with wood! I got up and asked, if so, how did he know how great they
                    were? This caused quite a rumpus. I learned later from my mother that my Latin
                    teacher, Professor Ergens, whose favorite I was, had to go to bat for me at
                    faculty meeting, where my 'subversive' question was discussed!</p>
                <p>Things came to a head - I can't remember the precise date - when a uniformed SA
                    man (Sturmabteilung, Storm Trooper or member of a special armed and uniformed
                    branch of the Nazi party) came into our first year Gymnasium class one day and
                    asked if anyone among the 30-some students was Jewish or had any Jewish
                    grandparents.</p>
                <p>Since all of us in the class were Catholic, nobody got up. When I mentioned what
                    had happened that evening, my parents looked very distressed and told me that I
                    did, in fact, have two Jewish grandparents, since my father came from a Jewish
                    family but had converted to Catholicism before their marriage. They stressed
                    that I must never be ashamed of this heritage. However, in the present
                    fanatically anti-Semitic Nazi atmosphere, where 'Mischlings' (half breeds) like
                    myself were treated almost as severely as Jews, this background was going to
                    cause serious dangers, which I must come to understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So until then, like Madeleine Albright, (the American
                        Secretary of State during the Clinton administration) you didn't know about
                        your half-Jewish background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right, and the reason is that there was such profound
                    anti-Semitism in Austria and Vienna...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, actually worse than in Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: ... actually worse than Germany. Many parents in mixed marriages were
                    therefore anxious to assimilate their children by raising them as Christians.
                    That may be what my parents tried to do - although even late in life my father
                    always insisted that his conversion had been sincere and genuine. For me my new
                    situation was all the more bizarre, since from early childhood I had had an
                    almost intuitive spiritual awareness, which I retained throughout much of my
                    life, and knew nothing whatever about Judaism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was the result?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The first thing I had to do, was to get up in class the next day and
                    publicly report the correct version of my origins, an announcement greeted with
                    scattered hoots and snickers by my Hitler Youth class mates.</p>
                <p>Then things began to move fast. I don't remember all the details, except that I
                    was frequently chased by my Hitler Youth classmates after school let out, and
                    sometimes beaten up. Things came to a head that summer of 1938, when a group of
                    Hitler Youths jumped me in the local swimming pool and came seriously close to
                    drowning me, a nasty experience, even though I somehow managed to get free and
                    make it home. Tension increased further that fall as we heard of people being
                    arrested, dismissed from their jobs, or taken off to Dachau and other
                    concentration camps. It was a time of intense uncertainty and worry, during
                    which many who could began to leave.</p>
                <p>Then, on November 9, 1938, came the famous 'Kristallnacht' when the SA unleashed
                    pogroms across the Reich, ostensibly to take revenge for the assassination in
                    Paris of Baron von Rath, a German diplomat, by Herschel Grynszpan, a 17-year old
                    Jew who wanted to avenge the deportation of his parents to Poland. Walking home
                    from school that day, I vividly recall making my way through squads of uniformed
                    Brown Shirts who were abusing and taunting Jewish people on Mariahilfer Strasse,
                    systematically smashing up Jewish shops, ransacking apartments and dragging
                    their terrified Jewish owners, including some very old and frail men and women,
                    out onto the sidewalks. Everywhere you looked Jews were jeered, beaten and
                    kicked while being made to scrub whitewashed Stars of David off the sidewalks
                    which were covered with shards of broken glass. Some onlookers and passersby
                    cheered the Nazis on. No one I saw did anything to help. It was a vile and
                    cowardly scene, which I have never forgotten.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened then to your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: In the roundup that day and in the days ahead, some 30,000 Jews were
                    arrested in Vienna alone and marched through the streets on their way to being
                    transported to concentration camps. Contrary to postwar claims, when former
                    Nazis were very hard to find in Vienna, this was a very public event. Everyone
                    knew precisely what was happening.</p>
                <p>For my parents and myself the first big blow came when they picked up my kind and
                    generous uncle, Paul Jaeger, my father's brother, who owned a well-known
                    stationary shop in the 1st district, and sent him to Dachau. He was released
                    some months later, but collapsed and died on the steps of the Westbahnhof (the
                    western railway station) in late January 1939, the victim of medical
                    experiments. Uncle Paul had always brought me small presents and loved me a lot.
                    It was my first major loss.</p>
                <p>As the Nazi campaign progressed, most of my father's family were taken as well
                    and died in various concentration camps, Dachau, Mauthausen and Theresienstadt.
                    Even my father's mother, then in her eighties, was hauled from her bed in
                    Innsbruck late at night, taken to Theresienstadt and died there.</p>
                <p>It was obviously high time to try to get out, although, for most, it was already
                    too late. Unbeknownst to me, my parents had been trying hard to send me to
                    safety as well, even though 'Mischlings' like me (people who had some Jewish
                    grandparents) were not yet prime concentration camp targets. Their effort, as
                    they later told me, seemed almost hopeless, since the Catholic Church, under
                    Cardinal Innitzer was playing it safe and offered no help. As for the Jewish
                    community, they couldn't even save their own.</p>
                <p>Then, one day in early February 1939, I had just finished my third semester of
                    Gymnasium, I was told by my parents, to my great surprise, that a 22 year old
                    English Quaker girl, whose name I never learned, had been sent to Vienna by her
                    Norfolk Quaker community to find and save children like myself - and had somehow
                    managed to arrange for thirty-some children, including myself, to go to England!
                    I was to leave a few days later!</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>It was only in recent years that I learned that she was a representative of the
                    now famous 'Kinder Transport', the brilliantly successful and generous British
                    effort to save as many children as possible from the impending holocaust,
                    launched in Parliament after 'Kristallnacht'. “Here is the chance”, Sir Samuel
                    Hoare, Britain's then Foreign Minister, told the House on November 21, 1938, “of
                    taking the young generation of a great people, here is a chance of mitigating to
                    some extent the terrible suffering of their parents and their friends”. He
                    carried the day and swayed the government to permit an unspecified number of
                    children under the age of 17 to enter the United Kingdom; a dramatic
                    humanitarian success, which stood in sharp contrast to the abject failure of the
                    8-nation Evian conference, which FDR had called a few months earlier to 'solve
                    the refugee problem'.</p>
                <p>All in all, about 10,000 children were saved through this unique operation in
                    which innumerable ordinary British families opened their homes in an
                    extraordinary act of national decency, which saved me and many, many others. It
                    was only recently memorialized in a, I think, rather too sentimental film, 'Into
                    the Arms of Strangers'.</p>
                <p>It was as a result of this improbable series of events, that I and 30 or 40 other
                    children found ourselves at 11 o'clock at night on February 20, 1939, waving a
                    last good-by to our sad parents out of the windows of a 3rd class railway car -
                    who stood forlornly on the gloomy, swastika-draped platform of Vienna's
                    Westbahnhof. It was far from clear that we would see each other again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Our sealed car crawled across Austria and Germany at a snail's pace for
                    almost three days, making way for virtually all other traffic. We had soon eaten
                    the apples and sandwiches our parents had given us, and were all crowded
                    together on the hard wooden benches, some sleeping, some crying, all dirty,
                    tired and hungry.</p>
                <p>Finally, when it seemed we had been completely abandoned, there was a sudden
                    shriek of brakes, the train stopped and we were at the Dutch border! The doors
                    were yanked open, and there, to our amazement, were four or five wonderful,
                    pink, white-aproned Dutch women with huge pots of boiling hot chocolate and
                    enormous dumplings! I'll never forget it. It was heaven. We all stuffed
                    ourselves and instantly felt better and more hopeful. Somebody actually cared!
                    We had, as I saw it years later, arrived in the West!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, these are obviously very intense experiences.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>JAEGER: The funny thing about children is that they are incredibly resilient. In
                    a sense, I experienced all this as an adventure and didn't really understand the
                    danger or fatefulness of it. It was only much later that it dawned on me how
                    incredibly lucky I had been, and, as it turned out, would be, again and again
                    throughout my life!</p>
                <p>From then on it was all a fairy tale! A ferry took many of us from the Hook of
                    Holland to Harwich where I was turned over to Miss Carr, a fortyish spinster, at
                    first a bit austere in her country tweeds, but kind and thoughtful, who loaded
                    me into her rattling little Austin convertible, and cheerfully whisked me off to
                    Hedenham Hall, her wonderful Georgian country house near Ditchingham in Norfolk,
                    a storybook place with a mile-square park full of old trees, hedges and streams,
                    alive with rabbits and birds!</p>
                <p>And, to round out the miracle, I was installed in my own little apartment
                    overlooking old brick walls surrounding a little rose garden and a goldfish
                    pond; assigned a kindly maid; informed that I was to have breakfast and
                    sometimes lunch with the grown-ups - a daily treat of porridge, several kinds of
                    eggs, toast , bacon and other fare in an array of gleaming chafing dishes - but
                    was to have supper in my rooms; that I was to go to Bungay Grammar school and
                    that I was henceforth to be known as 'Master George'!</p>
                <p>I loved it, and was not, I am afraid, as homesick as I should have been, although
                    I wrote dutiful weekly letters to my poor parents in Vienna! I loved English
                    manners, the old walls, the rows of ancient, pigskin-bound folios in the
                    library, the gardener who became my friend, the horses, spaniels and labradors,
                    and especially the serenity and pervasive calm of people who were part of a
                    tradition with deep roots in this green Norfolk countryside which became part of
                    me.</p>
                <p>Key to getting on, of course, was language. I learned English in the crook of an
                    oak tree by reading Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist from cover to cover; proudly
                    exchanged my Austrian lederhosen for flannel trousers at a tailors' in Norwich;
                    survived two terms in Bungay grammar school, where I seem to have gotten good
                    grades but remember learning very little; had my first-ever, awkward experience
                    with team sports and was taught to smoke under a bridge by a class mate with
                    whom I bicycled back to Hedenham every day after school. In short it was a
                    13-year old's paradise.</p>
                <p>That fall, when my English had made sufficient progress, I was sent off to King's
                    School in Bruton, a minor English Public School set in the rolling hills of
                    Somerset, not far from Bath - exceptional generosity clearly beyond what a
                    Viennese refugee youngster could have expected, even from very good-hearted
                    sponsors!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By public, you mean the English private schools?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, the English private schools.</p>
                <p>Academics there were much better than at the grammar school, particularly English
                    history - I still have notebooks filled with knights in armor - although I was
                    still well ahead in Latin, math and grammar from my Gymnasium days.</p>
                <p>New also was the emphasis on sports and military training: Rugger, played in cold
                    mud was a challenging part of daily life, as was compulsory ROTC drill with
                    heavy 'Lee-Enfield' rifles in scratchy English field uniforms whose brass
                    buttons needed daily shining. The defining “incident” occurred one cold, wet
                    day, when, utterly pooped, I came off the drill ground with my tunic undone,
                    dragging my rifle by the sling. Our handlebar-mustachioed Sergeant Major, a
                    retired British NCO, caught me and, with a withering glare, boomed across the
                    grounds for all to hear: “Jaeger, you are disgrace to his Majesty's Army!” I
                    never forgot!</p>
                <p>Being a 'fag', as new students were called, meant shining shoes and obeying
                    whatever other orders senior boys chose to give; and, worst of all, getting up
                    earlier than everyone else to carry hot water up a tight little gothic spiral
                    stair to the line of basins in our dormitory on the upper level of what had once
                    been a mediaeval chapel. In the end a group of us paid one of our fellows with
                    jams from home and other wares to regularly do this worst chore for us.</p>
                <p>Some other things stand out. One was the winter cold. As a new boy my bed was
                    near the ancient gothic windows which opened on their vertical axis. When it
                    snowed I was often covered and my blanket turned white. Another, was my
                    discovery that, as in many British boarding schools, homosexuality was
                    widespread, often nasty and took some avoiding. So was bullying. I settled that
                    one day in the billiard room when a big fellow taunted my accented English once
                    too often. I heaved a billiard ball at his head as hard as I could. He ducked,
                    it splattered on the wall, and I was never bothered again! I revisited that room
                    with some pride in 2004, 55 years later, when my wife Pat, our daughter
                    Christina and I stopped in Bruton and were most kindly received by a rather
                    surprised King's School administration!</p>
                <p>The experience I most vividly remember of my two terms at Bruton involved my
                    “conversion” of a number of my fellow class mates to Catholicism! On Sundays, we
                    were all marched, in twos and twos down the long village street to the ancient
                    parish church, wearing blazers and straw hats, to attend what we all thought
                    were exceedingly boring sermons. I had heard that one of Somerset's very few
                    Catholic priests made the rounds to his dispersed, small flock on his motor bike
                    on Sundays to say masses. Being still firmly Catholic, I was given permission to
                    bicycle to his nearest mass on Sundays, celebrated in a garage about six miles
                    away. So, instead of marching to church with the rest for the weekly Anglican
                    ordeal, I would merrily sail past them down the hill on my bike, waving my
                    boater at my glum-looking church-bound school mates.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Soon, one or two, and then more, began to ask if they too could come, since they
                    had just realized that they wanted to become Catholics! After a few weeks,
                    during which I gave 'spiritual instruction', and the bicycle contingent swelled
                    from Sunday to Sunday, I was called to see the Headmaster, a kindly man, who
                    explained that he simply could not face his Anglican parents with the news that
                    their boys had become Papists! Would I therefore desist and stop proselytizing
                    them!</p>
                <p>Being full of zeal and conviction, I refused! If the Holy Ghost led them to the
                    true faith, who was I to undermine their conversions! Things got heated. Letters
                    home were mentioned, as was expulsion. Like Luther I stood me ground, trembling
                    but firm! The result was a mutually face-saving draw. I would stop active
                    'instructions' and the headmaster would grant permissions only to those he
                    considered genuinely converted. On the following Sunday I was on my own again.
                    Not a victory, but also not discreditable for my first, but hardly last,
                    negotiation on an issue of principle!</p>
                <p>Bicycling, by the way, came in handy in another way, since I had fallen
                    desperately in love - a startling, but rather normal development for a boy of 13
                    which led me to bike to Bath through a snow storm during Christmas break to see
                    the object of my affections, Julia Swann, the equally adolescent, but, I
                    thought, radiantly beautiful daughter of a former British submarine commander,
                    now Bath Cathedral's distinguished Dean. After a thirty-some mile ride across
                    the snow-covered countryside, I collapsed on their door step, caused quite a bit
                    of anxiety, happily spent the Xmas holidays in Bath, and learned to appreciate
                    sherry and what I remember to be daring photographs administered and shown to me
                    respectively by Julia's more experienced older brother - who was memorably
                    dismissed from Christmas Day dinner for, it was claimed, getting Master George
                    drunk! I was there but don't really recall.</p>
                <p>In short, King's School, and all that went with it, was a rich experience. I
                    learned that things didn't always come easily, that privilege and respect had to
                    be earned, and that upper-class English life, for all its comforts, civility and
                    beauty could be much tougher than I had first thought at Hedenham Hall.</p>
                <p>For me, a Viennese refugee boy trying to develop a new identity and starting to
                    grow up, my two terms at Bruton were invaluable: Evenhanded, competent, but not
                    obsessive British schooling focused on fair play, chivalry, grammar, Latin, a
                    bit of math and history, with a heavy dollop of all-weather outdoor sports and
                    ROTC; in short it was still a gentleman-soldier's schooling, which is, after
                    all, what English Public Schools were all about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By then, of course, the war had broken out, very shortly
                        after you got to England?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>JAEGER: The war had broken out on the first of September 1939, when Hitler
                    invaded Poland. I don't recall that it affected our school life in those early
                    months, except that jam and other small luxuries were in reduced supply. At
                    Hedenham Hall the impact was greater. There was rationing, the flower beds and
                    sweeping lawns were dug up to make way for potato and vegetable fields. And
                    there were occasional air raid alarms and practices. I remember one such
                    occasion, when I was asked to serve as a pretend casualty lying in a ditch with
                    a lot of tags indicating various 'injuries'. The trouble was that I was somehow
                    overlooked by the home guard and not found for hours, leaving me cold, wet and
                    tired, as was so often the case in England in those years. But I did stick it
                    out.</p>
                <p>My most poignant recollection of those first months of the war, involves the five
                    or six bright, cheery, rather elegant young men, all members of Miss Carr's
                    family, who came up from Cambridge or Oxford between terms, had small house
                    parties, played tennis, and often took me along on long walks across the park
                    with Boogey, the spaniel, and other canine hangers-on, until the rather solemn
                    day on which they all appeared in Royal Air Force uniforms.</p>
                <p>We got the news, it now seems, only a few weeks later: They had, without
                    exception, been shot down as RAF fighter pilots in the disastrous British effort
                    to save Norway after the German invasion in April 1940.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Norway? Was this a squadron that was based primarily in
                        Norfolk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I don't know. As a young boy I didn't yet understand the war. All I knew
                    was that they had become pilots, that they showed up now and then, were fun and
                    terribly nice, took me fishing and shooting and then disappeared. The next thing
                    we knew, they were dead. I had lost my first boyhood heroes. I grieved for them.
                    Although England was as glorious as ever that spring, the war had become
                    real.</p>
                <p>I did see my father again in late April 1940, when he came through London on his
                    way to New York - having succeeded in the nick of time in getting an American
                    visa, after being rather ambiguously sponsored by Fordham University. Thanks to
                    Miss Carr's thoughtfulness and generosity, we had a two-day reunion in London,
                    which seemed shockingly drab and grey in this first year of the war, at a famous
                    hotel, I think the Dorchester.</p>
                <p>Father arrived with the equivalent of $10, all he was allowed to take out of
                    Germany, rumpled by two days on continental trains. He spoke only very broken
                    English, faced an, at best, uncertain future in New York and was visibly ill at
                    ease. I too had changed more than I realized, and was no longer the little
                    Viennese boy he had sent off from the Westbahnhof. So we 'celebrated' rather
                    awkwardly in the understated elegance of this great hotel with its self-assured,
                    tuxedoed waiters who, even in war time, flourished silver plate covers over
                    gleaming tablecloths.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>The crisis came early, when a huge bill was produced after our first dinner -
                    even though Miss Carr had assured me that all was taken care of - which my
                    mortified father of course could not pay.</p>
                <p>After some very awkward explanations we were able to retain our room subject to
                    clarification; but the rest of my father's visit was scaled down dramatically to
                    fish and chips in paper cones and long inexpensive walks along the Thames. Poor
                    Ms. Carr was crestfallen when she heard what had happened, and did the
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>The plan was that, once father was established in America and could save enough
                    for ship tickets etc., my mother who, as an 'Arian', was not in direct danger in
                    Vienna, was to follow - a process which turned out to be much harder and took
                    much longer than any one expected. After endless efforts to get visas she did
                    almost make it. But America went to war on December 7, 1941, a week or so before
                    her ship was to leave Lisbon. So she was left on the other side of the great
                    divide and spent the entire war in Austria under very difficult conditions. I
                    was not to see her again until I found her in Vienna as an American GI in
                    1945.</p>
                <p>As for me, my happy new English life came to an abrupt end, at high tea, to be
                    precise, on a glorious spring day in May of 1940. High tea, even in those days,
                    was still a grand affair, with the 20-foot long table in the library laden with
                    cakes, pastries, watercress sandwiches, jams and goodies of all sorts, and the
                    terrace doors open to the bright outdoors. The guests were always a cross
                    section of Norfolk's tweedy and in part very distinguished gentry, often
                    including friends like Lady Haggard, Sir Rider Haggard's widow, whom we
                    sometimes visited, and Lady Salmond, mother, I believe, of the first Marshal of
                    the RAF - the lot presided over by old Mrs. Carr, my Miss Carr's mother, a
                    distinguished silver-haired lady who ran things with authority and natural
                    precision and both loved and sometimes savagely beat her dogs after long and
                    muddy walks.</p>
                <p>It was at one such high tea in April, while I was contentedly munching some cake
                    below the salt, that I heard Mrs. Carr's high voice above the babble saying to
                    someone: “Master George, going to America? Why, the poor boy!”</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>That was how I learned that I was shortly to join my father in New York - where
                    he had made a footfall: First as a floor sweeper at Herbert Dubler, a company
                    which then imported Sister Hummel's Christmas cards and statuettes from Munich;
                    then promoted, in one swoop, to be the company's Art Director making Hummel
                    look-alikes, after Pearl Harbor suddenly cut Dubler's supply route from Munich.
                    Within a short time he and his small staff began adding their own product lines,
                    which imprinted my father's distinctive Austrian style on America's Christmas
                    card industry for decades. Only a few years later, in December '1948, he was
                    invited by Joyce Hall to become Hallmark's in-house art professor in Kansas
                    City, a role he filled for another seventeen years, bringing him full circle
                    from being an art professor in Vienna, by way of being a floor sweeper in New
                    York, back to being the in time much-loved art teacher in Missouri.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get to America in wartime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>My own travel arrangements at the end of May 1940, were marked by exceptional
                    security. My trip had somehow been arranged through wartime military channels -
                    I think through a Brig. General related to the Carrs. I remember being taken by
                    train to Liverpool, where I was turned over to someone else, and eventually left
                    to wait on some church steps with orders to stay there until someone came for
                    me! No other fail-safe instructions!</p>
                <p>After some considerable time - it seemed an eternity - a gruff sailor showed up,
                    told me to come along and took me to a pretty disreputable-looking hostel where
                    there was much loud carousing and other maritime carryings on that night, all
                    novel to a boy my age. On the following morning, May 30, 1940 I was taken to the
                    ship - Cunard's SS Antonia - and ensconced, back in 'Master George' mode, in my
                    own very pleasant upper deck cabin.</p>
                <p>My next surprise came when I looked out the next day and discovered that there
                    were British warships accompanying us from horizon to horizon!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in convoy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: No. They were all warships! They accompanied us half way across the
                    Atlantic, where a smaller array of Canadian warships turned up and relieved
                    them. Why this major effort for a lone ship became clear only when we got to
                    Halifax, after an otherwise un-eventful crossing. The docks were bristling with
                    troops and Bren guns mounted behind sand bags - as Canadian troops unloaded a
                    long stream of gold bars from our ship and stacked them in glittering pyramids
                    on the pier. I had been traveling on the ship which carried part of the gold
                    from the Bank of England to safety in America!</p>

                <p>JAEGER: At Fort Knox, precisely. So it was an unexpectedly historic voyage.</p>
                <p>When, a few years ago, the cruise ship I was lecturing on stopped in Halifax, the
                    historical people at Pier 30 - where all Canadian soldiers embarked and
                    disembarked in World Wars I and II - interviewed me. They were particularly
                    fascinated by the fact that there was an unexplained gap in their records in SS.
                    Antonia's frequent Atlantic shuttles, which coincided precisely with my crossing
                    and arrival. Given Antonia's vital mission we were officially never there!</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, how did you then get on in America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: My father, who had met me at the bus station in mid-town Manhattan on
                    June 12, at that point lived in a very modest apartment in an Italian
                    neighborhood in Brooklyn, where amply endowed ladies often sunned themselves on
                    window sills across our noisy street. It was a far cry from the reserved
                    gentility of Hedenham Hall and for me an exposure to an entirely different slice
                    of life. Through the Catholic Committee for Refugees I was given a scholarship
                    that fall to go to Pio Nono High School in Milwaukee, a musty, now defunct place
                    on Lake Michigan where, as a sophomore, I was miserably bored, learned to build
                    model airplanes but won the Wisconsin Poetry Reading Championship - mainly to
                    spite the school's debating team which said I had an accent and wouldn't let me
                    join.</p>
                <p>Then I was sent off to St. Vincent's Prep School in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, run by
                    monks of the Archabbey of the Benedictine Order in North America, where I
                    happily finished High School and then my wartime-accelerated first two years of
                    College.</p>
                <p>St. Vincent's gave me a wonderful grounding in philosophy, logic, language and
                    structure; I learned to play softball; earned my Bearcats football letter as
                    team manager; became a debater and twice won the Pennsylvania state debating
                    championship. I also gave many dozens of talks on my Nazi experiences in Vienna
                    at public meetings and war bond rallies, including one in a Pittsburgh stadium
                    before, I was told, an audience of 10,000 people. And, even though I was much on
                    the road, I still, managed to get decent grades, partly because my Gymnasium
                    training had really taught me how to study. My friend and constant supporter was
                    Fr. Edmund Cuneo, the school's peripatetic Headmaster, who balanced days of
                    intense activity, lightened by kind humor and passion for his causes, with
                    unostentatious meditation and humility. I found him late one night scrubbing
                    floors in the darkened hall ways. He was in monk mode doing penance.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>None of this, of course, had much to do with foreign affairs, except for a
                    crucial experience in my senior year in high school when, for the first time, I
                    fully grasped the interconnectedness of distant, seemingly disparate events.
                    Working the blackboard with sweeping arrows, Fr. Hugh, our gifted history
                    professor, explained the allied tank wars in North Africa in the context of the
                    larger strategic picture - as an effort to relieve pressure on the Russian
                    southern front and to deny Hitler control of Suez and Middle Eastern oil.
                    Suddenly a light bulb went on in my mind, as I began to grasp that all of
                    history was like this, an interlaced stream of large and small currents; that
                    one therefore always had to look for the interconnections in the broader
                    picture; and that particular decisions and events do have broader and much
                    longer-term effects and consequences.</p>
                <p>And then there was Mr. Moynahan, a kindly, very wealthy supporter of the school
                    in Pittsburgh. A few days after our debating team, Joe Hurley, Bob Height, Bill
                    Ucker and I had won the Pennsylvania state championship he invited us and Fr.
                    Edmund for a celebration, a baseball game at the stadium and a scrumptious steak
                    dinner at his oak-paneled club. His message, after we made little talks to thank
                    him, was simple: “I'll be richly rewarded”, he said to us, “if you will do the
                    same for others in your life times and so pass it on”. He taught us the
                    importance and power of gratuitous acts of kindness.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most lasting imprint of these years, however, was the daily Gregorian
                    chant, the mediaeval plain song and haunting silences of the eighty-some
                    Benedictine monks, the conversation with their Maker which has been underway for
                    1600 years and will, one hopes, continue to transcend injustice, war and misery,
                    as the French say, 'pour jamais'. Given the virtual disappearance of American
                    monastic life since then, and the decline of the Church's credibility in light
                    of scandals and rigidities, this may not be a realistic hope.</p>
                <p>Prep School - I had graduated in 1943 as Valedictorian - was followed by two
                    accelerated years at St. Vincent College, an intellectual non-experience, as I
                    remember it, studying chemistry in a desultory way, mostly because 'Doc Nolan',
                    the extroverted Irish chemistry professor, had talked me into it. Throughout
                    those years, the war remained only a worrisome backdrop, until it broke into our
                    lives with a vengeance just after D-Day, during my second college summer term in
                    1944.</p>
                <p>I still clearly remember walking across St. Vincent's softball field one lovely
                    June day, when I heard someone say, “Rollo has been killed!” It was like a body
                    blow. Rollo Champ had been our Prep School quarterback football star, a bright,
                    agile boy, whose quick courage and ingenuity won games and whose kindness and
                    thoughtfulness had won our loyalty and hearts. He went down on June 6, 1944 on
                    Omaha beach in Normandy.</p>
                <p>It was that fall, in September 1944, that I too joined the Army, half-way through
                    college, and was sent to train in Fort McClellan, a sprawling training camp near
                    Anniston, Alabama.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>We stayed in five-man huts, each with a stove in a sand pit in its middle,
                    drilled endlessly, learned to use rifles and mortars, did night exercises and,
                    after only thirteen weeks of tough, accelerated training, finished with a three
                    day combat exercise, whose climax, after a twenty-mile march with heavy packs,
                    was a simulated gas attack. It was during that maneuver that I was summoned,
                    told to put on my dress uniform, and driven to the courthouse in Anniston,
                    where, on January 20, 1945, I became a citizen of the United States! I also
                    vividly remember being gigged and put on extended KP peeling potatoes, for
                    reading a book in my foxhole!</p>
                <p>Only a few days later, it was off to Europe because, it was thought, replacements
                    were still needed for the Battle of the Bulge - even though the battle had
                    almost ended before we arrived. Five thousand of us crossed on an over-crowded
                    troop ship, a former ocean liner, bunks stacked five high and only a foot apart
                    in messy holds, riding heavy, grey winter seas. Given the pervasive seasickness,
                    bad ventilation and congestion I was rather pleased with my assignment to a
                    bulkhead deep down in the hold, which I was to close in case we were torpedoed
                    by German submarines which our two destroyer escorts were constantly searching
                    for. It was only after some days that I realized that due to a structural
                    anomaly, once I had closed the bulkhead, I would have had no way out! Mercifully
                    the Germans never caught us.</p>
                <p>So we did make it to the Firth of Forth in Scotland, which was bustling with
                    warships and transports of all kinds; thence on miserably crowded troop trains
                    to some truly bad “repple-depples” (the replacement depots through which new
                    troops were funneled) in the south of England; then via a channel transport, to
                    our destination, the bomb-skewered docks of Le Havre. There we were met by an
                    enthusiastic welcoming committee, hordes of highly motivated French ladies who
                    offered cheap wine and other on-the-spot services to make us feel 'bien venu en
                    France'. And, having thus celebrated our safe arrival, we were, to our surprise
                    and chagrin, marched off again that night with all our gear to another miserable
                    camp twelve miles away where we arrived in the wee hours of the morning. What
                    with inebriation, exhaustion and residual seasickness, it was a march most of
                    would rather not remember....</p>
                <p>Then, it was on to Belgium.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you saw action there in Belgium?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, but not very much. We were used to help with some mopping up
                    operations, but the worst of the battle was clearly over. Most of the time, as I
                    remember it, our replacement outfit moved forward in truck convoys over muddy
                    cold roads, stopping only briefly in gray, usually badly damaged French, then
                    Belgian villages. We were perpetually cold, dirty, smoking too much and eating K
                    rations, although occasionally there was a field kitchen with some hot food
                    slopped into our mess gear or helmets. Most of the time we didn't know where we
                    were or where we were going. The main challenge was to stay warm and dry. Hot
                    showers and a change of clothes were the occasional high points of our
                    lives.</p>
                <p>3. War Crimes and Concentration Camps: Hadamar and Flossenburg</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, where did you end up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: One day a group of us was billeted in a Belgian barn waiting for orders.
                    We were all lying on piles of straw in our combat gear, talking and playing
                    cards, when a most improbable apparition appeared, a Second Lieutenant in
                    creased pink pants and a pressed shirt from Fifth Corps Headquarters, who
                    announced that he was looking for a Private Jaeger! I had, as it turned out,
                    been reassigned to the Fifth Corps War Crimes Unit, where I was to be the new
                    German interpreter, because my predecessor had, unfortunately, just stepped on a
                    land mine!</p>
                <p>So, leaving the spiky base plate of my 81mm mortar without regrets, I found
                    myself the junior member of Fifth Corp's four-man war crimes team, a clearly
                    more interesting task. Led by a good-natured, lanky major, our team consisted of
                    a less than brilliant master sergeant who did our admin work, a driver and
                    myself. Following closely behind the front lines we moved up to and beyond the
                    Rhine which we crossed over the pontoon bridge which had been erected at Remagen
                    after the Ludendorff bridge collapsed. Our script was a 'secret' compendium of
                    wanted German war criminals compiled in Washington, as well as occasional fresh
                    reports from the 5th Corps intelligence people. Although the situation was still
                    chaotic, we diligently followed up as many leads as possible, often driving for
                    hours over rutted or bombed out roads. Predictably, we didn't have much success,
                    since our intelligence was often wrong, incomplete or, most frequently, the bird
                    had flown. Still, driving around Germany in springtime, unencumbered by routine
                    and discipline, was not heavy duty - even though we were surrounded by
                    destruction, misery and the swelling streams of refugees.</p>
                <p>We did, eventually, have one major success. It happened on a particularly nice
                    Sunday in late March 1945, shortly after we had crossed the Rhine, when my
                    Major, planning to enjoy the day, asked me to use my language skills to
                    'liberate' some cigars for him in a town called Hadamar.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Outside the cigar store an odd-looking man sidled up to me, chewing on his dirty
                    tie, and said, in a low voice and in broken English, that he was a French
                    intelligence officer who had been caught up in a German sweep. He had survived
                    by pretending to be insane and, as a result, he was now a trustee inmate in the
                    insane asylum just outside of Hadamar. The point he wanted to get across to me
                    was that this institution was actually being used as cover for one of Hitler's
                    extermination camps in which tens of thousands of people had been killed! I must
                    come and see for myself!</p>
                <p>I went along with him on a cautious reconnaissance, during which he showed me
                    ovens which had been used to dispose of bodies and other evidence that the
                    asylum was in fact what he had claimed. I instantly called my unit for help.
                    Within a short time a nearby American infantry company quietly surrounded the
                    place, and we succeeded in capturing the entire staff, who, hard to believe in
                    retrospect, had relied on the credibility of their insane asylum cover to
                    protect them from being discovered. Our team then began systematic
                    interrogation.</p>
                <p>The bottom line was that Hadamar was indeed an extermination camp where, over
                    several years, the Germans had murdered at least fifteen thousand people. The
                    first wave of killings, after 1941, involved gassing over ten thousand mentally
                    or physically handicapped Germans in a basement. They were then burnt in the
                    crematorium. The second wave, after 1942, involved the murder and disposition of
                    at least 5000 more, some euthanasia victims, most Eastern European and Russian
                    male and female slave laborers who had been sent there when they became too
                    exhausted or sick to work in Nazi war production plants in the Ruhr, around
                    Cologne and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What a story. Go on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: They victims arrived in trucks once or twice a week, usually at night,
                    having been told that they were going to a hospital for rest and treatment. They
                    were then actually put into nice, clean beds in a tidy ward, where the chief
                    nurse, Irmgard Huber, a motherly, pink-cheeked woman, whom I interrogated at
                    great length, would give them a heavy injection of scopolamine which killed them
                    in two hours. In the early stage the bodies were burned, a practice which was
                    stopped when the townspeople began complaining of the stench. Then, to conceal
                    the number of people killed regularly at Hadamar, they had the insane patients,
                    who were retained as cover, dig deep graves in the asylum cemetery, in effect
                    small mine shafts often a hundred feet deep, and simply stacked the bodies in
                    them. We found some still open, full of people recently killed, which had not
                    yet been topped off with soil and a little cross.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The staff's defense was that they were only following the asylum doctors' orders.
                    The doctor, in turn, pointed the finger at the Director. The actual boss, we
                    learned, was an obscure-looking administrative assistant, Alfons Klein, who, it
                    turned out, was the Gestapo agent in charge. We found a pass to Hitler's
                    chancellory in his belongings, with a notation that he was not to be questioned
                    by anyone whoever. We also found and blew open two safes in the cemetery shed
                    where we found complete hand-written records, kept with mind-numbing German
                    tidiness, of the names of all who died there - most with a notation that they
                    had died of TB!</p>
                <p>Hadamar, it was later established was only one of a top secret system of six
                    similar extermination sites across wartime Nazi Germany, code-named T-4, after
                    the address Tiergartenstrasse 4 in Berlin, part of Hitler's Reichskanzlei, where
                    the program was administered. The others were Brandenburg, Grafeneck, Hartheim,
                    Sonnenstein and Bernberg. All together 200,000 - 250,000 political prisoners,
                    retarded people, exhausted, mostly Slav slave laborers, and 722 half-Jewish
                    children from Vienna (!) were similarly disposed of - some of the last-named's
                    brains pickled and preserved for racial research. Even so, I discovered at
                    Hadamar, Jews were not the only victims of Hitler's Germany.</p>
                <p>Years later, rummaging in Harvard's Widener Library, I found the printed records
                    of the Hadamar War Crimes Trial - [the reference is 'Law-Reports of Trials of
                    War Criminals, The United Nations War Crimes Commission, Volume I, London, HMSO,
                    1947'] which were subsequently held in Wiesbaden in October 1945. If I remember
                    correctly, all were found guilty. Klein and two others we had arrested were
                    hung. The chief nurse got away with 25 years. How long she actually served is
                    unclear.</p>
                <p>I briefly revisited Hadamar with my wife Pat during a short leave from Embassy
                    Paris in the nineteen-seventies, and stopped to look around. No memorial, plaque
                    or other indication was in evidence to suggest that anything remarkable had ever
                    happened there. Many Germans even then were clearly not yet ready to face their
                    past. It was only in 1991, I gather, that a memorial was erected, almost a half
                    century after the fact. A German website
                    http://www.gedenkstaette-hadamar.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-533/_nr-1/i.html
                    now tells the essentials of the story and invites volunteers to explain to
                    visiting groups what happened there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened after Hadamar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Fifth Corps and its divisions moved on across Germany and our little unit
                    continued to follow behind the lines to search for, or interrogate, people on
                    our War Crimes list. At one point, our Fifth Corps HQ, no doubt for sound
                    strategic reasons, was located at the very peak of the American Army's huge Ruhr
                    Basin pincer movement, which had surrounded a whole German army in the 'Ruhr
                    pocket' and was facing another; to the east, a rather risky place for a major
                    command, with only ten miles or so between two fronts. As it turned out, all
                    went well.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Our next move, we thought, would be the last sprint to Berlin, a victory lap
                    which, to our great disappointment, was not to be! I always thought that this
                    loss of nerve, and the subsequent failure to take Prague, were Eisenhower's two
                    greatest mistakes - setting the stage for many of our post-war problems with the
                    Soviets.</p>
                <p>But that's getting ahead of the story, since, in the meantime, the capture of
                    hundreds of thousands of German troops, for which we were logistically
                    unprepared, created major headaches for us and serious hardship for them -
                    including unnecessary deaths which led to subsequent accusations of Allied human
                    rights abuse.</p>
                <p>I got a graphic lesson in all this when, I was abruptly told one day to “take
                    temporary charge” of a POW enclosure about ten miles to our north, holding over
                    ten thousand Germans! What I found was an ocean of makeshift tents and lean-tos,
                    with thousands of POWs simply lying on the ground, untended wounded, no medical
                    supplies, inadequate latrines and minimal food rations. I asked who their senior
                    officer was. It turned out to be a stiff German General out of central casting,
                    who stood ramrod straight before his little tent in polished boots and full
                    regalia! We - I think I was still a Private First Class at the time - had a
                    short and rather difficult conversation, in which I told him I would do my best
                    to help.</p>
                <p>I tried. But we moved on the next day and relief probably came too late for many
                    there. On the way, our team uncovered more bad stuff, particularly in Kassel,
                    where I remember investigating a jail where one prisoner's torture consisted of
                    deliberately covering him with lice. It was simply awful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to any concentration camps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, just before we got to the Czech border in Bavaria we were diverted
                    to help open Flossenburg, which had been liberated on April 23, 1944.</p>
                <p>It was a bizarre and terrible scene. As we arrived, the place was already
                    swarming with dozens of Army brass, news people, investigators from all levels
                    of command, and ordinary GIs. Streaming towards us were crowds of skeleton-like
                    inmates in their famous zebra suits, holding out hands, welcoming us or simply
                    holding on, too weak to stand or walk. Beyond them, near the prisoner's huts
                    were six-foot high stacks of corpses, piled naked, men and women of all types
                    and ages.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Although our team was outranked and had no real role, we went into some of the
                    long huts with their rows of quadruple-decker wooden bunks, each shared by two
                    or three starved and emaciated, sometimes demented prisoners, who welcomed us as
                    best they could. It was clear that, liberation or no, for most of them it was
                    too late. My sharpest memory is of the distinctive acrid smell of death, of
                    unwashed bodies and despair.</p>
                <p>We heard terrible stories. Of the backbreaking labor in the quarry pits, of the
                    crematorium into which corpses slid down a long, mechanized incline, their
                    number often exceeding its capacity. If so, they were stacked up or burnt
                    outdoors. I heard that the SS made soap of the dead prisoners' bodies, and of
                    the last-minute killings of many, just before the first GIs arrived. I later
                    learned that over 10,000 were taken on a deliberate death march to the south,
                    just days before we arrived. 7000 are said to have died en route.</p>
                <p>Investigations and trials later established that probably many more than the
                    officially estimated 100,00 Czechs, Poles, Russians, Jews, 'intellectuals',
                    'deviates', criminals and others on the Nazi hit list, were sent to Flossenburg
                    and its sub-camps from over thirty nations, since it was opened in 1938. Of
                    these, at the very least a third, and probably many more, were murdered or
                    succumbed to mistreatment, illness and overwork in the quarries and war
                    production plants run by Messerschmitt, Flick, Siemens, Osram, Junkers and
                    others. Interestingly, there are some accounts of limited inmate resistance,
                    albeit mostly from former East German Communist sources.</p>
                <p>Flossenburg was also the 'home' of 'special political inmates', housed separately
                    from the ordinary prisoners, including Austria's last Chancellor, Kurt von
                    Schuschnigg, French Prime Minister Leon Blum, Pastor Martin Niemoeller and
                    others. And it was the place of execution of major German resistance figures,
                    including Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Admiral Canaris and General Oster.</p>
                <p>Of all these people we were able to liberate only 1,527 in the main camp, and
                    many of them did not survive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How on earth did you react to this experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I have often thought about this. The situation we found confirmed
                    everything we already knew but surpassed it in its banal concreteness. I saw the
                    corpses, the hundreds of living skeletons, talked to some, understood the
                    immense evil which had been perpetrated there, knew this was an historic turning
                    point, and shared in the intense feeling that this must never happen again, that
                    they must not have suffered and died entirely in vain.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>What I actually did - as generals, newspaper photographers, GIs of all sorts and
                    ranks, and many others milled around in this nightmare - was to sit down in the
                    light spring sunshine, not far from a pile of naked corpses. I pulled out my K
                    rations, ate my lunch, because it was time and I was hungry, and said a deep
                    silent prayer for all of them.</p>
                <p>In later years I often thought that, in a way, I was no better than the Germans,
                    that I should have cried, shown my grief, told everyone that I too had relatives
                    who had died the same macabre deaths in Mauthausen, Theresienstadt, Dachau and
                    Auschwitz, done something memorable for someone there.</p>
                <p>The fact was, that none of us could handle it and so we just didn't talk much,
                    went on in our jeeps next day, were secretly glad to be living and doing our
                    jobs. Although farther down there was a deep, glowering anger and moral outrage
                    at all we had seen there and elsewhere over the last months.</p>
                <p>In my case, it broke through on several occasions: Once when I was billeted in a
                    specially comfortable upper-middle class German house, undoubtedly belonging to
                    well-to-do Nazis, I got massively drunk and then, single-handedly and
                    systematically, smashed and broke every bit of furniture, glassware, bric-a-brac
                    and what-have-you in the entire house. My Major gave me a bit of a talking-to,
                    but clearly understood.</p>
                <p>In one of the Hadamar interrogations, I also got close to the line when one of
                    the prisoners who had participated in the killing of many inmates taunted me and
                    told me that he was proud of what he had done and to have been a Nazi. I had a
                    terrible impulse to shoot him on the spot. Mercifully, I reigned it in and
                    didn't.</p>
                <p>Even so, these experiences have remained etched in my mind and became one of the
                    motives which led me, and so many of us of the World War II generation, to want
                    to go on afterwards to build a more civilized, humane and better world.</p>
                <p>4. Victory: Pilsen and Prague</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you then continue on to Czechoslovakia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER; Yes. By early May the German Army had virtually disintegrated, the
                    Americans and the Russians had met at the Elbe, the battle of Berlin was under
                    way and we all knew, as we pressed on across the Bavarian border, that the war
                    was almost over. In our final push Fifth Corps's Sixteenth Armored Division,
                    supported by another Division from the south, liberated Pilsen on May 6, 1945 -
                    a glorious, deliriously happy day.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I remember vividly how our command car, wedged into an endless column of muddy
                    American trucks and tanks of the 16th Armored Division, rolled into town. The
                    long streets running through Pilsen's then grubby, rundown suburbs were lined
                    with thousands of jubilant, cheering Czechs! Girls were throwing us flowers,
                    people were singing and shouting, everyone was waving flags and handkerchiefs
                    and, although desperately deprived after years of war and occupation, people
                    offered us sausages, bread and even bottles of the then very thin Pilsner beer.
                    When we arrived in town, the main square too was jammed with cheering people and
                    was already decked out with an American flag. It was all a smaller-scale rerun
                    of the tumultuous scenes which had played out at the liberation of Paris! It was
                    great!</p>
                <p>The following day, May 7, 1945 the war was officially over!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see Patton there, as Commander of the Third
                        Army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Not that day, but we were given a photo-op! A stand had been set up in a
                    field with his various flags. We were lined up, kept waiting interminably, then
                    told that we would be permitted to take pictures for five minutes! Some guy
                    shouted, “Who wants to take his picture!” Patton, as you know, was not much
                    loved by his troops! The great man finally showed up, wearing his trademark
                    silver helmet and holstered pistols on his leather gun belt, said a few words,
                    posed for five minutes looking a bit like Mussolini, and left. It was not a
                    high-point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what was left to do in Pilsen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER; After that, it was R&amp;R and light make-work at our 'liberated' HQs
                    compound on the outskirts of town; civil affairs tasks; restoring basic
                    services; doing initial damage assessments of Pilsen's Skoda Works, the huge war
                    production plant the Eighth Air Force had bombed only a few days before to keep
                    its machinery from falling into Soviet hands.</p>
                <p>The only major remaining issue was whether we would go on to Prague. Our forward
                    tank patrols had probed into its outskirts. According to Martin Gilbert's “The
                    Second World War” (Revised edition p.690), at least three American vehicles were
                    in Prague on May 7th, the day of the Czech uprising against the Germans, but
                    were ordered to pull back. As we learned later, Churchill had pressed to take
                    and keep every inch of territory we could, at least as bargaining chips with
                    Stalin. But Truman deferred to Ike and opted to stick with a strict
                    interpretation of what had been agreed at Yalta. So Prague fell to the Russians
                    - with incalculable consequences during the long decades of the Cold War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this go over with the troops?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>JAEGER: All of us in Pilsen understood that it was crucial for the Americans to
                    take Prague. Later official claims that no one knew how badly the Soviets would
                    behave are nonsense.</p>
                <p>On the contrary, there was disappointment, even anger among the troops on the
                    ground when we learned that our advance columns had been ordered to stop and the
                    Soviet forces were able to come westward across much of Bohemia to a nearby
                    demarcation line - preceded by a wave of German units, anxious not to end up
                    dead or in Siberia.</p>
                <p>5. Taking the surrender of an SS Division</p>
                <p>JAEGER: For me, all this had one very unexpected consequence. On a particularly
                    lovely day just after our arrival in Pilsen I 'liberated' a bike, slung my
                    carbine over my back and, with a sandwich in my pocket, went off to explore the
                    countryside. I may have gone several miles, whistling and celebrating in my own
                    way that the war was over, when, coming around a bend on a narrow dirt road at
                    the edge of a forest, I found myself staring directly into the cannon of an SS
                    tank with a fresh and lively looking crew of SS soldiers on top! To make matters
                    worse, behind it I could see a seemingly endless column of other tanks, their SS
                    standards flying, their weathered, battle hardened crews perched on the turrets
                    sunning themselves, all silently staring at me!</p>
                <p>It was a totally absurd situation! The question, of course, was: What do you do
                    on a bicycle, with your carbine on your back, when you are looking at a German
                    SS Panzer division at about 20 yards. If I stopped and reached for my gun, I was
                    clearly a dead duck. If I didn't, and just went on biking, I remember thinking,
                    I would at least not be shot in the back and would show them that I was not a
                    coward!</p>
                <p>So I biked on, past the first tank, waved at the fellows in the tank, who looked
                    absolutely “gobsmacked” (flabbergasted), as the British would say, then past the
                    second. Nothing happened!</p>
                <p>After passing a dozen or so more tanks, I saw someone waving farther down the
                    line. An SS officer came running toward me. This is it, I thought. But he only
                    signaled that I should stop, then stepped aside and left me facing the SS Panzer
                    Division's leather-jacketed Commanding General standing between two tanks,
                    surrounded by several other officers!</p>
                <p>He explained, formally and very politely - my German was very helpful at this
                    point - that they had retreated before the oncoming Soviet forces and had been
                    hiding for several days looking for a safe way to surrender to the Americans! My
                    arrival was therefore most fortunate, since they did not want to become involved
                    in any accidental fire fight with the Americans. Would I therefore accept the
                    Division's surrender on behalf of the United States?</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>I tried to look as dignified, under these clearly historic circumstances, as was
                    possible for an only recently promoted Private First Class; said I would be glad
                    to do so; but needed the General's Luger pistol as a token of his surrender to
                    take to my superiors! He simply handed it to me, we shook hands and both
                    saluted. I got back on my rusty bike and pedaled back, the way I had come,
                    waving to my prisoners of war with new assurance!</p>
                <p>Back at V Corps Headquarters it took a bit of convincing, given the nature of
                    chains-of-command, to get some follow-up. When I told my sergeant that I had
                    just accepted the surrender of an SS Panzer division, he came very close to
                    putting me on a week's KP (kitchen police)! Even when I had talked my way up the
                    ladder, a Major on duty was certain there were no stray Panzer divisions around.
                    I finally spoke to the colonel in charge of our intelligence: “Oh my God,” he
                    said, “we've been looking for this division, and we couldn't find it. Thank you
                    very much!”</p>
                <p>So my facts were confirmed and a second more “official” surrender was arranged,
                    to which, I am annoyed to report, I was not even invited! They even kept the
                    Luger!</p>

                <p>6. To Vienna through the Soviet Army!</p>
                <p>JAEGER: The great personal issue I carried with me through all these experiences
                    was that my mother had been left behind in Vienna, having been prevented by
                    America's entry into the war after Pearl Harbor from reaching her boat in Lisbon
                    and joining my father in New York.</p>
                <p>As a result of this accident of history, she spent the entire war in Vienna or,
                    for months on end, hiding in Sillian, a small village in East Tirol, where a
                    kind veterinarian and his family took her in. She suffered greatly from
                    deprivation, since the Nazis had denied her most of my father's small pension
                    and she had only the barest financial means; from loneliness; and, of course,
                    from constant fear of being arrested, even though she was the “Aryan” member of
                    our family. Most painful was being cut off from her family in America, since the
                    only means of communication during the war were very occasional short messages
                    forwarded through the Red Cross.</p>
                <p>The worst came during the last months of the war, in February and March of 1945,
                    when, during the heavy American bombing of Vienna, she spent weeks in great
                    danger and under severe hardship in the cellars below her tiny flat in the
                    Palais Pallavicini in the 1st District, which was part of a network of cellars
                    in that part of town. As she later described, it was a dreadful ordeal, as
                    masses of starved, terrified, some of them crazed people tried to survive in the
                    damp darkness of this rat-infested labyrinth.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>During this time, the city endured a reported 80,000 tons of bombs aimed at
                    electricity, gas and water supply, many of which missed their targets south-east
                    of the city and destroyed residential structures and famous landmarks instead.
                    Among the 12,000 some buildings destroyed, was St. Stephen's Cathedral, the
                    Schwarzenberg Palais and the Vienna Opera, as well as the zoo in Schoenbrunn,
                    all much beloved by the Viennese and later rebuilt and restored. Her final
                    ordeal was the Soviet battle for Vienna and its attendant atrocities, followed
                    by months of hunger as the Soviet-occupied city starved. She had a very rough
                    war.</p>
                <p>It was therefore my overriding concern to find her as quickly as possible after
                    the war had ended, which proved difficult since the Soviets were now in full
                    control of Vienna.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before the four-power occupation was worked out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That did not happen till July 1945. Within days after we got to Pilsen
                    and the war had ended, I went to see one of our Brigadier Generals who, after
                    listening to my story, was kind enough to send a request to his Soviet
                    counterpart across the new demarcation line to grant me a laissez-passer to
                    Vienna on humanitarian grounds.</p>
                <p>The Soviets responded with a prompt and resounding 'Nyet'! Although this was
                    discouraging, my General friend was not ready to give up. There was, he
                    explained quietly, a young Lieutenant in a nearby Artillery Company, for whom he
                    had done some favors. If I wanted to be transferred there and then just went
                    AWOL (absent without leave) for a few days, he would make sure that no one would
                    notice. If I didn't come back on time, I would, of course, have to be viewed as
                    a deserter and could expect no help. “ I'll take the risk,” I said. “Thank you,
                    General, so very much! But, there is one more thing. May I take a guy along who
                    knows about cars ?” He agreed to that too.</p>
                <p>And so my adventure began. I was promptly transferred, found a tough, car-savvy
                    buddy, Fred Kaufman, who was crazy enough to go along with me; 'liberated' a
                    Tatra automobile in Pilsen; and then persuaded the new American-appointed,
                    pliable Mayor of Pilsen to issue us very impressive documents with many seals
                    and stamps which said in four languages that he, the mayor of Pilsen, permitted
                    Pfc. George Jaeger and Pfc. Fred Kaufman to go to Vienna! [</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Equipped with this document and our pretty dilapidated car, we innocently
                    set off toward the east on June 19 or 20, 1945 having absolutely no idea what we
                    would encounter or the risks we were taking. Its something only a 19-year old
                    would do!</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>We got through the first Russian checkpoint by simply waving our fancy document
                    at the guards. We quickly deduced that only high-ranking Russians, KGB (Komitet
                    Gosudarstvennoi Bezopasnosti - Soviet Committee of State Security) officials and
                    Soviet generals had private cars. So when check point guards, usually unkempt,
                    sometimes drunken or illiterate Soviet soldiers, saw our car coming along, they
                    assumed we were high-powered people they had to be careful with.</p>
                <p>How rare cars were on the Soviet side became even clearer when we encountered the
                    first of the many moving Soviet military units we were to run into or pass on
                    our drive east to Vienna.</p>
                <p>They were an extraordinary sight: The Soviet General riding stiffly ahead of his
                    mounted staff officers, followed by mechanized artillery crawling along in
                    grinding first gear at 3 or 4 miles/hour (!). Then came endless columns of
                    marching infantry in their once white, now dirty tunics - an amazing tough,
                    sunburnt and exotic-looking lot from every part of the Soviet Empire, followed
                    by Cossack units on small prancing horses. And behind all of this would come the
                    heavily laden American Lend-Lease trucks, decorated with flowers and pictures of
                    Stalin, also grinding along in first gear at marching speed!</p>
                <p>Finally, bringing up the rear, we would pass lines of rickety green horse-drawn
                    wagons, often many dozens of them, laden with the unit's loot, their chickens,
                    goats, pianos, bird cages, furniture and beds, and, of course, their camp
                    followers - women of all origins and descriptions, sometimes plaintively singing
                    Slavic peasant songs.</p>
                <p>At first we were terrified when we encountered and passed these Soviet divisions
                    on the move. Overcoming our fear, we came to realize that passing their long
                    dusty lines at speed added to the air of authority we apparently projected, with
                    the result that, on several such occasions, we were even saluted, and returned
                    the salutes of the commanding officers as we overtook them!</p>
                <p>In the end, Fred and I ran a gauntlet of, I believe, 12 successive Soviet Army
                    roadblocks between the outskirts of Pilsen , Bratislava and Vienna. At some our
                    'dokument' worked fine, at others taking the guards' picture did the trick,
                    supplemented by much-sought-after American cigarettes. We were hugely relieved
                    each time when we got through!</p>
                <p>The worst roadblock we encountered was some ways west of Bratislava, where the
                    guards first wanted to turn us in, but then, after some tense negotiating, said,
                    “Fine, we'll let you go, but you will have to take this woman off our hands”,
                    pointing to a huge, noticeably smelly peasant woman who weighed well above 250
                    pounds! We agreed, put her in the back seat, but drove only a few miles when a
                    loud bang brought our Tatra to a wobbly halt!</p>
                <p>The rear tire had burst irreparably under her weight! And we had no spare!</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: So there we were, two AWOL GIs on the outskirts of Bratislava, deep
                    behind Soviet lines, with our dubious laissez-passer and a broken-down car! We
                    pushed the Tatra to a less conspicuous place and then spent nerve-racking hours
                    looking for a new tire, hardly plentiful in Bratislava at that time! We were
                    finally taken to a fellow who, in return for some of our nicest silk stockings
                    and six (!) cartons of cigarettes, was willing to sell us a tire. Under the
                    circumstances it was a bargain...and a very close shave indeed.</p>
                <p>Our mobility restored, we found quarters for the night and a wonderfully warm
                    reception in a farm house a bit south-east of Bratislava. Once they got over
                    their amazement that we actually were Americans, we were royally feted with
                    heaping plates of scrambled eggs, bacon and potatoes and plied with homemade
                    schnapps!</p>
                <p>Then they poured their hearts out with stories of what they had been through,
                    first under the Germans, now under Soviet occupation. It was from these kind and
                    simple farmers that we first learned why the Russians were so feared and hated.
                    Their troops had no rations, therefore lived off the land, stripping farms and
                    towns of everything edible, and stealing whatever was not tacked down. Stories
                    of 'Russki' soldiers with six watches on their arm, or of the simple Siberian
                    fellow who had stolen an alarm clock and machine gunned it when it went off,
                    were already legendary. That this ramshackle military operation defeated the
                    German war machine and made it from Stalingrad to Berlin, Budapest and Vienna, I
                    wrote to my father at the time, was truly extraordinary!</p>
                <p>The next day, rested and fed, we set off for the last lap into Vienna over
                    increasingly pitted and cratered roads, making it, unchallenged, into Vienna
                    from the east - first over the Reichsbruecke, the then only passable Danube
                    bridge, then on a makeshift wooden pontoon over the 'Wien', the little damned
                    tributary which runs through the eastern part of the city.</p>
                <p>We were high in spirits but short on gas, and then - did something truly stupid!
                    In Pilsen, we had always helped Russian soldiers who had wandered over to our
                    side, given them gas or a meal, and sent them on their way back to their sector.
                    So we assumed that once we got to Vienna the Russians might be helpful to us in
                    turn. So we stopped in front of Vienna's neo-gothic City Hall on the Ringstrasse
                    and said to the guard, “We're GIs, and we would like to ask you if we could have
                    some gas.”</p>
                <p>He grunted: “Dokumenta!” and pointed upstairs. So I climbed up the sweeping
                    marble steps, having very wisely left Fred in the car with the motor running for
                    a possible quick get-away. Once upstairs, my worst premonition was confirmed. I
                    was taken to a Russian officer in a large ornate, gilded room, his field-boots
                    draped over a delicate baroque desk, who stared hard at me and also just barked:
                    “Dokumenta!”</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Well, I didn't like the looks of this! I turned abruptly, ran down the stairs as
                    hard as I could, passed two startled sentries with fixed bayonets and jumped
                    into our car. Fred had seen me coming and took off down the Ringstrasse with a
                    roar, direction Hofburg. We got a good head start before some Soviet jeeps came
                    roaring after us. They fired a few shots as they chased us down the Ringstrasse,
                    my friend driving as hard as he could! What saved us was my intuitive childhood
                    recollection of Vienna's 1st District's geography, because, after turning off
                    the broad, and so most dangerous Ringstrasse into the ancient little streets and
                    alleys of the 'Innere Stadt', I was able to yell to my friend, “Turn right. Turn
                    left. Left again. Right, and so on.”</p>
                <p>We finally lost them and made it to the back door of the Palais Pallavicini which
                    gives onto the narrow Brauener strasse, where I thought my mother lived.
                    Fortunately, the high wooden carriage gate to the inner courtyard was open! We
                    drove inside, slammed and barred the heavy portals, and disappeared up a narrow
                    stair case where, soon after, I actually found my mother!</p>
                <p>She was weak physically and shaken psychologically. She had been through a
                    terrible time. What's more, my turning up so abruptly, in my GI shirt and boots,
                    with no advance warning, was a major shock. We both had clearly changed a lot
                    since she had last seen me as a boy of twelve! Even so, we spent two memorable
                    and, on the whole, very happy days together - getting reacquainted.</p>
                <p>The setting, of course, was grim. Vienna in June 1945 was pockmarked with
                    cratered pavements, gutted buildings, roofs missing and askew, walls ripped open
                    and everywhere grey, tired, frightened, undernourished people. Whole areas near
                    the Prater, where the fighting had been heaviest, were virtually flattened, with
                    only chimneys and bits of wall sticking up from the rubble. We went to see our
                    old apartment house, undamaged, and to Schoenbrunn, the Emperor's summer palace,
                    where the gardens where I had learned to walk, were in sad disrepair. We went to
                    the Volksgarten, near the damaged Burgtheater, where mother had gone almost
                    every day throughout the war, now fragrant with Vienna's famous lilacs which
                    bloomed gloriously in stark contrast to their sad surroundings. We walked
                    through the gutted shell of St. Stephen's Cathedral and saw the heavy damage to
                    many of the historic and ordinary buildings.</p>
                <p>In context, Vienna's destruction was not worse than I had seen in other cities -
                    some suburbs in particular were less affected. Even so, the Viennese had paid
                    heavily for their Nazi enthusiasms and their German Anschluss!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have had quite a reunion!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>JAEGER: We did. To celebrate my seemingly miraculous arrival, my mother invited
                    her little circle of wartime friends for 'Kaffee” in her tiny flat to meet her
                    soldier son: the Molnars, 'Pachi', the Margrave Pallavicini's old Hungarian
                    caretaker, who had been good to her, Petzi, a close friend, and a half dozen
                    others! They pooled their last bits of Ersatz coffee in my honor and sat
                    solemnly around our little table, in their worn dark suits and austere dresses -
                    as the sun set over the ancient roofs of Vienna's battered and now sadly
                    occupied inner city. My arrival was their first sign that the war was really
                    over!</p>
                <p>Things, became more tricky that evening, June 22, when my mother took me to the
                    ballet at the Volksoper - the Opera having been gutted in American raids.
                    (According to the program notes saved in my file it was Mozart's 'Les Petits
                    Riens', Rimsky-Korsakov's 'Capriccio Espanol' and Schuman's 'Carnival). We had
                    bought tickets at the 'Theater Kasse' nearby on the Braeuner Strasse, where my
                    mother had proudly introduced me to the man at the counter as “my American son.”
                    This produced great joy and prime tickets on the house - in third row center
                    parquet! I thought no more about it, until, dressed in my unadorned green GI
                    shirt without insignia, but wearing my dog tags underneath, just in case I had
                    to prove I was an American GI, we appeared at the theater — a silver-haired,
                    thin, elderly Viennese lady in an old- fashioned dark dress, and I, a very
                    unpressed, hopefully incognito GI.</p>
                <p>Then I saw, to my horror, that our prime seats were at the center of the section
                    reserved for, and already populated by, what seemed, the entire General Staff of
                    the Soviet Army in Vienna!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It was too late to turn back. We made them all get up, because our seats,
                    the best in the house, were in the very middle! One general sat next to my
                    mother and another next to me, with no end of Soviet brass in sight in either
                    direction. And this only two days after their MP jeeps had chased me down the
                    Ringstrasse! I was sweating blood and saw myself in vivid colors en route to
                    Siberia!</p>
                <p>When nothing further happened, beyond polite nods all round, it gradually dawned
                    on me that this was a replay of the salutes we had received from Commanding
                    Officers on the road! Because of our clearly privileged seats they simply
                    assumed that we were important somebodies, perhaps from Moscow or the KGB, in
                    any case some privileged civilians not to be messed with. In short, they were
                    afraid of us! My mother never realized how close a shave that was!</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Even so, my visit to Vienna did not go unnoticed. On one of our walks near the
                    Kaerntnerstrasse, I was accosted by a distinguished, older man who said quietly,
                    “ You are an American! Thank God you have finally come!” He had recognized the
                    color of my GI shirt! He turned out to be the then Director of the Sacher Hotel,
                    which had suffered during the war, had seen top Nazis come and go, and was now
                    filled with Soviet troops, like all the other great hotels. I explained that I
                    was not there officially but only to find my mother. He said, “Never mind. You
                    are the first American soldier in Vienna! The others will now come! We finally
                    have hope! Whenever you yourself come back, you will always be welcome at the
                    Sacher!”</p>
                <p>As it was, I never followed up this kind invitation, but do remember his shocked
                    account of the arrival of the first Soviet troops, who built open fires on his
                    hotel's lobby's marble floors to cook their food under tripods! I myself still
                    have photos, taken that day, of herds of thin 'liberated' cows being driven down
                    the Ringstrasse, the Praterstrasse and other main city arteries by Soviet
                    soldiers for their evening meals.</p>
                <p>What drove the Viennese's intense fear of the Soviet Army, and left an enduring
                    image of Soviet barbarism, was the tidal wave of looting and rapes which
                    followed their arrival. This was even my mother's uppermost concern, since there
                    were many credible accounts that neither grand-mothers nor pre-adolescent girls
                    were being spared! Later statistical studies showed an extraordinarily steep and
                    abrupt increase of syphilis and other venereal diseases in Vienna's population,
                    whose timing corresponds precisely to these events.</p>
                <p>And yet, one of my most haunting memories of the Soviet Army during those fateful
                    two days, are of the dozens of Soviet women soldiers sitting on window sills of
                    the Bristol Hotel and other buildings, their legs dangling in the void, holding
                    Tommy guns or balalaika's, and singing, deep-throated, deeply moving, moody
                    Slavic songs as they surveyed the destruction which was then Vienna. For them
                    too a terrible war was over.</p>
                <p>For me two big problems remained to be solved: First, to provide my mother with a
                    reliable source of food and emergency support till I could come back to Vienna
                    officially; and secondly, that we still somehow needed to get a lot of gas if we
                    were to make our way back through the Soviet lines to Pilsen.</p>
                <p>Luckily, we were able to solve both. Food and help was arranged through an
                    English relief office which had just been opened and which generously agreed
                    that my mother could regularly come to eat there. As for gasoline, my mother had
                    mobilized her friends. Word went out to the Viennese police that there were
                    Americans in town who needed help. Furtively, quietly, dozens of policemen came
                    to our obscure courtyard the next morning where our battered Tatra was parked,
                    bringing little cans and bottles of carefully saved gasoline, and gradually,
                    almost drop by drop, filled up, not only our gas tank, but two or three jerry
                    cans - enough to give us a chance to make it back. And this in a post-combat
                    Vienna where officially there was no gas!</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>I have never forgotten these anonymous helpers who came through, at great risk to
                    themselves, when help was badly needed. I owed them my life. We were now set to
                    go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you went back, on the 23rd?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. Since the Soviets might now be looking for us, we traveled mostly
                    over back roads and in the dark throughout that night, got lost several times,
                    although we had fair maps, and were almost caught near the demarcation line just
                    a few kilometers south-east of Pilsen. Eventually we did make it, almost out of
                    gas, and fell onto some Army bunks totally exhausted but happy and grateful that
                    we had been able to pull it off! Looking back, it was a remarkable five days,
                    during which we had aged and learned a lot!</p>
                <p>7. First Americans in Vienna?</p>
                <p>JAEGER: There is one more aspect of this caper, which needs to be recorded. It
                    happened as we were driving east out of Vienna toward the Reichsbruecke, on a
                    long, then desolate road devoid of cars - I think it was the Lassallestrasse -
                    when we saw an official, American-looking staff car coming towards us. I said to
                    Fred, “No, we mustn't get involved! Step on it. Let's just keep going.”</p>
                <p>As luck had it, however, someone in the oncoming car twigged on the color of our
                    shirts. They screeched to a halt, made a U-turn, followed us, overtook us. We
                    all stopped. It turned out to be the very first party of reporters from the New
                    York Times and one or two other news services, who had been given permission to
                    come into Vienna after the war. And, as luck would have it, we were the first
                    persons they met!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (Laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Their initial, rather human, reaction was chagrin at having been
                    'scooped' - since meeting two GIs coming out of Vienna as they were making their
                    first post-war visit, was a bit deflating. Even so, notebooks came whipping out
                    as they asked what we had been doing, how things were in town etc.</p>
                <p>We tried to explain that we were in a seriously dangerous situation: That we were
                    AWOL from the U.S. Army and could even be tried as deserters if the Army learned
                    of our unauthorized excursion behind Soviet lines by reading about it in the
                    papers!</p>
                <p>They swore on a stack of bibles that they would protect us and would only use our
                    info for background. So we did give them a brief account, that we had gone
                    through the lines to find my mother and had succeeded.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>When, a few days later, I got back to my billet in Bischofteinitz , I found a
                    telegram from my father in New York on my bunk saying, “Wonderful news George!
                    You made front page of New York Times, and I'm so glad mother is well!” He later
                    sent me the clipping, which I have just reread as I revise this text. Under a
                    headline, “Allies get ready to enter Vienna”, dateline June 25, it reports that
                    the Allies may move into sections of Vienna within three weeks under the command
                    of Gen. Mark Clark, that the Viennese “are overjoyed at the prospect” (no one we
                    met had heard of this when we were there!) and that their “expectancy had been
                    stirred by the sight of other Americans in the city, unofficially”!</p>
                <p>It then reports, under a heading “New Yorkers in Vienna”, that “Americans
                    'unofficially' in Vienna, included Pfc. George Jaeger of 710 Riverside drive, NY
                    who found his mother safe in the city. He was accompanied by Pfc. Fred Kaufman
                    of 34-59 86th Street, Jackson Heights, Queens.” The report also mentions
                    Lieutenants Dan Larner and Peter Hart as having been part of the “American
                    party”, whom we neither knew nor met. With that qualification it is likely that
                    we were probably among, or perhaps the first uniformed Americans in Vienna after
                    World War II.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, the Army never noticed this front page story, or if they did,
                    chose not to pursue it. I was uneventfully reassigned in early July to a
                    five-man military government team which was to run Marienbad.</p>
                <p>8. 'Governor' of Marienbad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is in the western tip of—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Which is in the western tip of Bohemia. Its the famous spa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Of 'Last year in Marienbad' fame.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's it, the elegant spa where Europe's aristocracy, its Kings and
                    Emperors used to summer in the nineteenth and early twentieth century to
                    socialize, take the waters, make deals, have treatments and so on.</p>
                <p>When our team arrived, Marienbad, which the Czechs now call “Mari�nsk� L�zne”,
                    had suffered some war damage and was run down after years of abuse by military
                    garrisons, but was otherwise essentially intact, although services were not
                    functioning and water mains were out.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Moreover the place was a full of displaced persons, a crisscrossing snarl of
                    unwashed, hungry, weary humanity, all on the move to somewhere: German soldiers
                    whose Russian war was over walking the endless roads trying to go home. Sudeten
                    Germans, who had earned Czech hatred for their support of the Nazi takeover of
                    Czechoslovakia, who had just been evicted and trying to flee to Germany. Poles,
                    gypsies, Russians, Ukrainians and all sorts of other people who had survived
                    German PW or labor camps and were streaming in from the west trying to get home.
                    Among all of them were many sick and injured and large numbers of women going in
                    all directions looking for lost men. All were seeking food, shelter and some
                    kind of life after the catastrophes that had befallen them.</p>
                <p>That's what all of western Europe was like in those summer months of 1945. The
                    world was like an ant heap, thousands of people moving in all directions, along
                    endless roads in infinite grey lines, on foot, on carts and bicycles, in
                    dilapidated cars and trucks, crisscrossing Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a major new challenge. How did your team

                <p>JAEGER: Actually, with all the panache of a scene in M*A*S*H! The Major in charge
                    had brought his Italian mistress and installed himself in a villa on Marienbad's
                    famous golf course with the message: “Don't bother me unless there is a major
                    crisis.” Experience showed that he really meant it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Besides an otherwise useless driver, there was also a nice sergeant,
                    standard army issue, who was clearly not the right choice to lead the
                    reconstruction of Mari�nsk� L�zne. All of them had had a bad time in the Italian
                    campaign and felt that their war was over. So it was decided that I, being the
                    German speaker, should sit in the mayor's office in City Hall and let them know
                    if I needed help! That's how, at the ripe age of not quite 19, I was for all
                    practical purposes made the governor of Mari�nsk� L�zne - till we were abruptly
                    withdrawn from Bohemia in November 1945.</p>
                <p>My main problems were that virtually nothing worked, that there were no American
                    resources to draw on, and that I had zero expertise. So, after taking stock and
                    thinking about it for a few days, I called in my musty Czech assistant - a
                    rumple-suited holdover in City Hall who later turned out to be working for the
                    Czech communists waiting to take control when we left - and told him briskly
                    that I wanted the 20-or so most influential people in Marienbad in my office the
                    following day at three o'clock sharp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you felt that Communist presence even then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Oh, yes. They had a shadow government even at town level which caused us
                    a lot of trouble.</p>
                <p>So, to continue, the next day a couple dozen of pretty frightened, shabby-looking
                    gents showed up at city hall, with no idea what I had in mind. I kept them
                    waiting a bit to heighten the effect, then called them in and said as fiercely
                    as I could: “Look, you have one week to get this town into working order. Its a
                    disgrace! I want the water to run, sewers to work, electricity restored and the
                    hospital open for basic services. Otherwise, there will be serious
                    consequences!” They asked the obvious next question: “How?” Simulating the harsh
                    bark their just-departed German occupiers might have adopted, I told them,
                    “That's your problem! Now get to work!” My gamble was that they were used to
                    German behavior and didn't realize that I had absolutely no capacity to enforce
                    anything, that all this was a bluff!</p>
                <p>Lo and behold! By the time I walked to my billet that evening, there were people
                    all over town digging up sidewalks with picks and shovels. Within a week there
                    was noticeable progress. We certainly didn't have the town in working order,
                    even when we left in November, but some basic things were getting done. And,
                    after a while, the effort gained some popular support as people began to
                    understand what we were trying to do - my first lesson in 'nation-building'!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have made you feel that you were making a
                        difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, yes and no, because we were only inching forward a tiny bit on a
                    narrow front in a context which was increasingly out of control. While the US
                    Army did have some DP camps in the area, they were nowhere near the scale
                    needed. And, as I learned later, the human crisis was aggravated by Allied
                    agreement to the resettlement and expropriation of Sudeten Germans at Potsdam in
                    July 1945 - eventually 1.7 million were to be sent to the American Sector in
                    Germany, and perhaps three quarters of a million to the Soviet zone - a brutal
                    process of ethnic cleansing which Eduard Benes new 'democratic' Czech government
                    had set in motion by mid-June.</p>
                <p>The struggle with the Communists also clouded the picture, even in my City Hall,
                    since they constantly made their shadow presence felt. As a result of these
                    Soviet-inspired pressures, Benes hope that his post-war Czech Republic would
                    somehow become a “bridge” between east and west ended in tragic defeat, in the
                    complete Soviet take-over of Czechoslovakia in 1948 under Gottwald, and in his
                    own death three months later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware of this background at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>JAEGER: We knew next to nothing of this developing larger picture, and were left
                    to cope as well as we could with our worms-eye perspective of the disasters
                    developing around us. In my letters home I wrote again and again of the
                    deprivation and despair which hung over the streams of humanity wandering the
                    roads around Marienbad - as they were to wander all that year and much of the
                    next all over Europe. I wrote of my disenchantment, my anger with the Czechs,
                    who, barely liberated themselves, had not an ounce more mercy for the Sudeten
                    Germans they were driving out onto the roads by the thousands, than the Germans
                    had had for them. I was miserably frustrated by our inability to help the
                    hundreds who lined up every day at our office looking in vain for lost
                    relatives, food, money or help in recovering homes and properties. And I came
                    back again and again in these letters to the innumerable individual tragedies we
                    encountered, including the many, in other circumstances respectable women, who
                    sold themselves, indeed vied for the privilege, for a meal, a bed, a little
                    money and, perhaps, some warmth and affection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been a tough experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAGER: I did win one battle, although it was a short-lived victory. It happened
                    one day when I got a call that the local Czech Communists were deporting a whole
                    trainload of people they had rounded up in our area to work in the beet fields
                    in Slovakia or even further east.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these the ethnic Germans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, Sudeten Germans, a trainload of them parked on a siding at the
                    railroad station. There were hundreds of people of all sorts, many older men -
                    since most of the young had disappeared in the war - the majority women, some
                    pregnant. They knew that, once sent east, they would most probably never come
                    back.</p>
                <p>I was, of course, aware of the role the Sudeten Germans had played in bringing
                    about the downfall of Czechoslovakia, their often vicious collaboration with the
                    Nazis before and during the war, and the extent to which they had done the dirty
                    work in concentration camps and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>But, I also understood that this was not how people should be treated, regardless
                    of Czech grievances, that this was a new war crime in the making which would, in
                    part, be on my conscience if I did not intervene.</p>
                <p>So I called up our local Army HQ and urgently asked for a platoon of soldiers for
                    immediate back up. We marched down to the train, fixed bayonets, told the
                    Communists in charge to get out of the way, unloaded the train at gun point and
                    sent the people home.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER; Yes, it was a brief victory in what later came to be known as, the battle
                    for human rights - even though I probably acted in contravention of America's
                    Potsdam commitment! I wryly recalled all this years later, when we were
                    struggling with the successors of these Czech communists over a human rights
                    passage in the Helsinki Final Act we were negotiating in Geneva. The principles
                    involved are just as relevant now, in view of our own atrocities and war crimes
                    at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, in CIA rendition camps and elsewhere - a record of
                    which we should not be proud.</p>
                <p>Even in the short run my little effort did little lasting good. The minute we
                    were abruptly pulled out of Czechoslovakia in the fall of 1945, the Czechs
                    finished the eviction of Sudeten Germans in areas which had been under our
                    control. My wife Pat and I visited southern Bohemia in the spring of 2002 on our
                    way to Prague. We passed through Cesky Krumlov, Telc and other, once wholly
                    Sudeten German towns, whose German roots have been erased and 'cleansed'. They
                    are now all Czech.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was your own life in Marienbad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Considering this was central Europe just after the end of the war, we
                    lived extremely well, in bizarre contrast to the misery all around us. I was
                    billeted in a pleasant room in one of Marienbad's elegant, if somewhat rundown
                    hotels, my balcony overlooking lawns and gardens with old trees, fountains,
                    neo-classic statues and even goldfish ponds! Meals were provided in a formal
                    dining room with chandeliers, served by traditionally-clad waiters, often to the
                    accompaniment of musicians and gypsy groups which the Army's admin people picked
                    up from time to time.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Life in Marienbad was also stimulated by unusual people and events. There was the
                    former American woman professor who had somehow been caught there by the war,
                    whom our medics had nursed back to reasonable health and who then rewarded us at
                    dinner with her rich, erudite, sparkling mind. There was the American Colonel
                    who tried to smuggle a distinguished Czech friend's wife out into the American
                    zone of Germany in the trunk of his car - and was caught, with tragic results.
                    The newly arrived American Ambassador, Laurence Steinhardt, who became a notable
                    player in the Benes drama, set off a day of unwonted spit and polish when he
                    made a brief visit. And - this is a very peculiar memory - there was the
                    mesmerizing bearded Jew who 'sent' for me one day out of the blue and had me led
                    to his ample, richly carpeted hiding space in an old building, where, and this
                    was the incredible part, he had survived the Nazis and the entire war! He
                    laughed at me, offered some superb Cognac .... and his services - suggesting
                    that he had had similar profitable contacts with the Gestapo before we came. I
                    stayed clear of him and am not sure whether or not he was involved in a major
                    drug ring reaching through the Balkans to Turkey which our intelligence people
                    busted later in the fall.</p>
                <p>To round out this totally surrealistic scene, I myself had somehow acquired use
                    of a former SS riding stable with 20-some superb horses the Germans had stolen
                    somewhere, and spent many off-duty afternoons cantering gloriously across the
                    extraordinarily beautiful, largely untouched Bohemian countryside.</p>
                <p>9. Paris, Chartres and Norfolk</p>
                <p>JAEGER: By November 1945 we knew we would soon be leaving, although not before I
                    was able to take my first leave since I had arrived in Europe: To visit Miss
                    Carr at Hedenham Hall, and my aunt Lilly, one of the few holocaust survivors on
                    my father's side, in London. The Army's rattling troop train, made up of 'forty
                    and eight' cattle cars, traveled west from Pilsen, rumbling endlessly through
                    the desolate, war damaged grey villages and towns of Germany and France.
                    Packed-in, rumpled GIs were lying and sitting on the bare floors, smoking and
                    drinking, playing cards, talking of their war, of girls, sex, the occupation and
                    of eventually of going home ... after the war in Japan would finally be
                    over.</p>
                <p>For me the climax of our journey came when, just before we finally arrived in
                    Paris, French thieves boarded the train and stole many of our duffle bags while
                    we were sleeping; in my case containing not only my clothes but all my money
                    and, most importantly, cartons of American cigarettes, the then most negotiable
                    currency in Europe.</p>
                <p>After a brief moment of panic I recouped by selling my splendid officer's
                    sleeping bag at a spontaneous auction in a corner of the Gare du Nord, where,
                    almost instantly, a crowd of shabby Parisians materialized, all facing a hard
                    winter without heat, to compete for the comforts of this major prize! The
                    proceeds were enough to pay for my ticket to London and to do some sightseeing
                    in, at that time, bleak and dowdy-looking Paris, quite unaware that I would one
                    day serve there for four years in much better times in our Embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>My happiest recollection of that leave involved the rainy day-trip I made on a
                    rusty commuter train to Chartres, a place to which I was drawn even before I had
                    read Henry Adams' 'Mt. St. Michel and Chartres'. When I arrived the cobbled
                    cathedral square, not yet surrounded by todays hotels and restaurants, was wet,
                    unwelcoming and empty. And the ancient cathedral looked somber, with creeping
                    shadows obscuring the nave, admitting only dimly opaque blue light through its
                    the famous windows. Still, the hour or so I spent there alone that day among the
                    soaring columns disappearing into the cathedrals' gothic vaults were a deeply
                    healing experience. My outlook on life was also dramatically improved by an
                    absolutely glorious roasted chicken, cooked specially for me by a kind old
                    French woman at a tiny, long-extinct bistro off the cathedral square and the
                    memorable bottle of old Bordeaux she offered me which she had successfully
                    hidden in her cellar from the Germans!</p>
                <p>Some thirty-five years later I was to take my very old father back to Chartres a
                    short time before he died. He too loved it, although the wine was no longer as
                    good as that rare bottle had been in November '45 with which the old lady and I
                    celebrated France's liberation. I felt restored and full of fresh happiness when
                    I made my way back to Paris.</p>
                <p>Then it was on to England and reunions, first with aunt Lilly in London, then,
                    after an endlessly bumpy ride on locals, to Bungay, Norfolk, where a kind
                    switchman, himself a veteran, invited this cold, soaked Yank into his warm
                    railway shed for a cup of tea.</p>
                <p>Miss Carr, visibly happy and excited, met me with the same, now even older Austin
                    convertible with which she had once fetched me as a refugee child from the
                    Harwich ferry! And at Hedenham Hall, they were all there to welcome me, my old
                    maid, the gardener, and others of the family, including a young Brigadier on the
                    British General Staff, who actually wanted to know my views on how our war had
                    gone. Even old Mrs. Carr, more bent and fragile than I had remembered, was
                    overjoyed that I had come back safely from the war.</p>
                <p>It was a wonderful return to the quiet civility of my Norfolk 'home', where, the
                    unstated message was that I had earned my place: Still far below the salt, with
                    no promotion - but definitely, my place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you stay in Marienbad after this leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: After my leave things moved swiftly. By late November American forces had
                    been withdrawn from Czechoslovakia, which was left to continue its sad decline
                    into becoming a Soviet satellite. There were no good-bye parties. On the
                    contrary, my letters recorded sadly, that many Czechs in our parts of Bohemia
                    seemed actually glad to see us go since we had shared neither their enthusiasm
                    for Soviet Communism nor for the ethnic cleansing of Sudeten Germans.</p>

                        background. But before we go on, what happened to your mother?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>My own fate, after some string-pulling, was to be reassigned to USAREUR ( US Army
                    Europe) Headquarters in the IG Farben building in Frankfurt, since I needed an
                    effective springboard for a transfer to Vienna to bring out my mother. I
                    succeeded, and shortly thereafter was reassigned from Frankfurt to the War
                    Crimes unit in Gen. Mark Clark's Headquarters in Vienna, established after the
                    Americans had moved into their sector in July. As a result, I found myself on an
                    elegant sleeper train to Vienna on December 23 - in time to celebrate my first
                    Christmas with my mother since I had left in 1939!</p>
                <p>We had a wonderful reunion, went to the 'Fledermaus' on New Year's Eve and
                    celebrated with her friends with the meager means available! Although my mother
                    was still technically an 'enemy alien', so not entitled to use the PX system, I
                    was soon able to arrange for an ample food supply through the generosity of
                    another kind Brigadier General on Gen. Clark's staff who let me use his general
                    officers' mess card once a month to buy supplies!</p>
                <p>This became a major event, for each time I arrived in my mother's narrow
                    Braunerstrasse with my jeep bulging with goodies, people would rush to their
                    windows and call “Der Ami kommt!!” (The GI is coming!). My mother knew many of
                    them from the nightmarish weeks they had spent together in the cellars during
                    the American air raids and the Soviet attack, and shared our spoils as well she
                    could. They were all terribly undernourished, in spite of the mountains of peas
                    the American Army provided which made people bilious and were not an adequate
                    diet.</p>
                <p>As to her trip to America, there were still frustrating delays, since nothing
                    could be done until the American Embassy had finally reopened in Vienna. When
                    that finally happened, she received the very first non-quota Immigration visa
                    issued in Vienna after the war from Vice Consul M.B. Lundgren on April 30, 1946.
                    She rejoined my father, after a forced separation of seven years, in New York on
                    May 25th.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's an incredible saga. Tell us a bit about your work
                        there?</hi>

                <p>JAEGER: My war crimes work at Mark Clark's headquarters during those months in
                    Vienna in 1946 was negligible and unproductive. I was detailed for a few
                    delightful weeks to a unit in Gmunden, a beautiful little town on the Traunsee
                    in the Salzkammergut, where the workload was even lighter and I spent many lazy
                    days sailing a little borrowed boat on the Gmundner See, exploring the
                    surrounding hills and forests, and waiting for someone to tell me what to do.
                    There were some SS people in detention in the area who, I believe, we were
                    supposed to interrogate. But that somehow never happened.</p>
                <p>The only remarkable memory of that period - beyond the time I spent walking with
                    my mother in the Volksgarten and other haunts in Vienna, and the many evenings I
                    listened to Joseph Krips conducting the regenerating Vienna Philharmonic from a
                    loge I had rented for the season - was of the huge 'top secret' volume which
                    came across my desk one day in Vienna - a detailed intelligence record of the
                    Warsaw ghetto massacre.</p>
                <p>It was a dreadful document which, besides its long, detailed text describing what
                    had happened, included hundreds of photos showing Jews being herded through the
                    streets of the surrounded, burning and shell-pocked ghetto, jumping out of
                    windows, being beaten and shot, desperate people who knew they were all
                    doomed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was it secret?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Probably because it was raw investigatory war crimes material, circulated
                    to help US and Allied forces identify and arrest the Germans involved. The
                    document contained pictures of many German officers and soldiers carrying out
                    sweeps, committing atrocities, as well as lists of those wanted for war
                    crimes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you must have returned from the Army shortly after
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. Hundreds of us crossed Germany in June 1946 in a long troop train, a
                    happy, celebrating crowd of GIs, unmindful of the hard benches and K-rations. We
                    then awaited transport in a very relaxed transit camp in Bremerhaven, where some
                    of us were even able to rent more congenial quarters in a nearby village,
                    checking in only for roll call in the morning.</p>
                <p>The subsequent crossing on a troopship was also uneventful, except that, as we
                    were coming in sight of New York harbor, the ship's loudspeakers went off:
                    “Sergeant Jaeger. Sergeant Jaeger. Would Sergeant Jaeger take charge of the
                    latrine detail on deck three!”</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>JAEGER: It was thus that I managed to miss the Statue of Liberty and the by then
                    standard little band on the dock playing march music to welcome us home!</p>
                <p>I was discharged with the exalted rank of sergeant in Fort Dix on July 25,
                    1946.</p>
                <p>Part II: From Harvard, via State, USIA and McCarthy, to the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>1. From St. Vincent's to Harvard</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's now turn to your return to the U.S. and the
                        resumption of your education. How did that go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, after I was discharged from the Army, I packed up my Eisenhower
                    jacket, visited my parents in Kansas City and returned to St. Vincent's College
                    in Latrobe, Pa. to finish college.</p>
                <p>Compared to the devastated Europe I had just left, St. Vincent seemed timelessly
                    tranquil and untouched by the cataclysms which has just torn the world apart - a
                    transition which required some major readjustments. Like so many GIs, I too
                    found that my wartime experience had broadened and transformed me. Although I
                    did not have coherent views on foreign affairs as yet, it was quite clear to me,
                    as it was to so many other returning WWII soldiers, that we badly needed to get
                    busy building a better world. So I abandoned chemistry, which I had never much
                    liked anyway, and for my last two years in college focused on history,
                    philosophy and government. I also gained some practical experience in editing
                    the college paper and continued debating. I evidently did well, since I
                    graduated com laude in 1948 and was asked to be Valedictorian of our class, but
                    don't remember these rather sheltered years as particularly challenging or
                    exciting.</p>
                <p>The foreign affairs side of the story only began late in my senior year, when my
                    government professor, Paul Mahady, a dashing local lawyer, who had been a
                    Harvard graduate, brought his convertible to an abrupt halt near where I was
                    sitting on the grass watching a softball game and called out that I should come
                    to see him, because I was “going to Harvard!”.</p>
                <p>Needless to say I was stunned. Mahady, who had evidently thought well of me, had
                    simply written to his friends at Harvard without my knowledge and arranged to
                    have me accepted in the new Littauer International Affairs Program, which even
                    offered some financial aid to supplement my GI Bill of Rights!</p>
                <p>It was another of those many gratuitous events which again and again completely
                    changed the direction of my life! I have often wondered whether in today's much
                    more competitive and bureaucratic academic environment, I could even have made
                    the cut!</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>2. The Harvard International Affairs Program</p>
                <p>Be that as it may, I was off to Harvard in the fall of 1948, one of twenty
                    members of the second class of the Littauer Program for International Affairs, a
                    special, interdepartmental two years' Masters program designed to fill America's
                    new post-war need for broad-gauged people to help manage and carry out our
                    foreign affairs.</p>
                <p>For me it was an amazing, transforming experience. I quickly discovered that my
                    Benedictine education had made me fairly expert in mediaeval philosophy - I was
                    quickly nicknamed the “little Thomist” - but left me at a disadvantage in the
                    broader world of liberal education. In our seminars, and particularly in the
                    great, barracks-like graduate dining hall, where people from all the faculties
                    carried on constant, fascinating conversations about everything from Gropius'
                    new architecture and methodologies of literary criticism to Renaissance and
                    contemporary politics, I found that I clearly had some serious catching up to
                    do. I somehow managed and gradually began to thrive in this exciting new
                    environment.</p>
                <p>Part of it was the caliber of my fellow students, many of whom were indeed
                    remarkable. A year ahead of me in this two-year program, were Henry Kissinger,
                    (the prize student of Professor William Yandell Elliott), as well as Zbigniew
                    Brzezinski, then as now brilliant, acerbic and clearheaded. There was Sam
                    Huntington, now famous for his prescient book on the 'Clash of Civilizations';
                    and of course Stanley Hoffman, our bemused French-American colleague, now one of
                    Harvard's University Professors, then as now intensely competent, wise and
                    perceptive.</p>
                <p>There were other, subsequently less famous but in their various ways equally
                    important colleagues: Frank Keenan my sage and patient roommate in Divinity
                    Hall, from whom I learned much of American politics. He has remained a lifelong
                    friend and over the years contributed importantly as a senior Congressional
                    staffer. There was Peter Warker, enthusiastic, super hard working, and later my
                    roommate in Washington when we were both impecunious beginners there. He became
                    an eastern European economist in the Foreign Service and later worked in private
                    enterprise. Another was our irrepressibly cheerful and highly competent Canadian
                    colleague, Lennie Wainstein, later of ARPA and the Rand Corporation who too has
                    remained a good friend. Last but not least I should mention a somewhat older,
                    and to me impressively cosmopolitan member of our group, who had done some
                    hush-hush work, presumably with the OSS, and later became a high-level executive
                    in the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>The International Affairs Program itself, like so much at Harvard in those days,
                    was a loosely coordinated, almost casual interdepartmental operation, run by a
                    young Government Professor, Alan Burr Overstreet, who taught courses on
                    international organization and on the newly created UN. We of course had some
                    shared requirements and discussions, but were otherwise free, under his general
                    supervision, to take any of a wide range of graduate courses and seminars across
                    the spectrum of Arts and Sciences offered by a pantheon of eminences: Carl
                    Friedrich, later the author of Germany's new constitution; William Yandell
                    Elliot, the political theorist and spellbinding lecturer, who had been advisor
                    to FDR and father of the Bureau of the Budget, a device designed to help
                    Presidents get a grip on Cabinet departments and bureaucracies; brilliant young
                    McGeorge Bundy, later of Vietnam fame; the new Sovietologists, like Adam Ulam,
                    at the Russian Research center; Talcott Parsons, the student of Max Weber, whose
                    dense, difficult lectures were full of Germanic syntax and seminal insights
                    about the mechanics and structures of social organizations; and, last but not
                    least, Alois Schumpeter, the former Austrian Finance Minister in the 20's, who
                    became one of the world's most influential economists with his theory of
                    creative destruction. I took and survived his course on Socialism, even though
                    he often cited quotations in four or five languages! There was a host of
                    others.</p>
                <p>This rich and challenging environment was supplemented by the constant stream of
                    world class visitors to Harvard, who ranged from TS Eliot, whom I heard read
                    from the 'Wasteland', and Siobhan McKenna, who brilliantly performed her famous
                    St. Joan, to a parade of political and intellectual leaders from all corners of
                    the world, as well as gifted musicians, artists and performers of all sorts.
                    They all constantly enriched our lives and tempted us away from our work.</p>
                <p>I also had my first opportunities to teach undergraduates as Dr. Oversteet's
                    Assistant and even inflicted a full-dress lecture on them on 'Policy Formation
                    in the US Government', a performance which, given my lack of experience, could
                    not have been very enlightening.</p>
                <p>It all came to an end in late spring 1950, when our group was awarded their MAs
                    on a sunny day in Harvard Yard. We had spent two superb years reading, working
                    hard, discussing policy and country issues and growing much faster than we
                    realized. It was a brilliant and exciting time.</p>
                <p>The issue I then faced was whether to leave and go into the Washington
                    bureaucracy, or stay on to become an academic, as some people urged. I remained
                    ambivalent but decided to remain at Harvard at least till I had finished my
                    doctoral oral examinations, which I passed in January 1951.</p>
                <p>3. State Department intern.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>One of the great advantages of the International Affairs Program had been that it
                    arranged for unpaid summer foreign affairs internships, my first in the summer
                    of '49 as a gopher in the Office of the Secretary of State! I still remember how
                    awestruck and inspired I felt on seeing our national capital for the first time
                    and how privileged to have been asked to begin my practical foreign affairs
                    education at the center of the process.</p>
                <p>a. When not to read 'Das Kapital'</p>
                <p>Actually I may have owed this chance to the inattentiveness of an FBI agent. I
                    was taking Schumpeter's course on 'Socialism' that spring and one sunny
                    afternoon was sitting in my room in Divinity Hall trying not to go to sleep over
                    some particularly dense pages of Karl Marx's 'Das Kapital”, part of Schumpeter's
                    assigned reading, when suddenly there was a knock and an FBI man appeared. He
                    said he was working on my security clearance and wondered if he could ask me
                    some questions. He sat down at the corner of my desk, just a few inches from my
                    open copy of 'Das Kapital', interrogated me for over an hour, but never once
                    looked at what I was reading! Given the growing anti-Communist hysteria of the
                    time, I have often wondered what my fate would have been if he had noticed!</p>
                <p>b. Cranking the Xerox machine in Acheson's front office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they have you do in Acheson's office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I was attached to a small group of assistants who were in a sense the
                    precursors of the huge 'seventh floor' apparatus of more recent years.</p>
                <p>My boss for the summer was to John Kuhn, who patiently took me under his wing as
                    I learned to help backstop the interdepartmental committee then planning the
                    first Military Assistance Programs. It was a terrific first look at government
                    wheels in motion at a senior level, since I was able to attend all their
                    meetings in the Department and hearings on the hill and had my first contact
                    with people like Assistant Secretaries in these committees. I don't,
                    unfortunately, remember much of the details of these discussions, except that
                    they left me with a new understanding that, regardless of level, one was still
                    only dealing with human beings, who, were fallible and not always even well
                    informed; and that internal Department politics were a major driving force in
                    policy formulation. Among the senior staffers I particularly remember Brad
                    Patterson, whose passion was effective high-level organization and who in later
                    years became a senior staff officer in the White House. His book on 'The White
                    House Staff', published by Brookings, is still very much worth reading.</p>

                <p>In sum, I spent an exciting summer doing fascinating, high-class donkeywork.
                    Among the papers that an intern was asked to take to the Xerox machine were as
                    often as not drafts of what later became famous NSC (National Security Council)
                    documents on critical issues. You trotted them around to the Policy Planning
                    Staff, the Secretary's office or to other high-level places in what was then New
                    State.</p>
                <p>Looking back, what proved most valuable and important, were not the specific
                    policies I became familiar with, but the topflight people I met and the
                    atmospherics I absorbed. While Washington itself was still a sleepy southern
                    city, these were my first contacts with serious foreign policy makers and their
                    staffers who made the system work - major role models in their various ways for
                    later years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there ever any crises while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I do recall that even this lowly intern had a few moments of genuine
                    responsibility, to whit when, on my turn on the duty roster, I was occasionally
                    awakened at night by various bureau duty officers and asked to decide whether a
                    particular issue was of sufficient importance to wake up the Secretary of State.
                    If I thought so, my instruction was to call a Mr. Brown, who was the permanent
                    senior duty officer in 'S', who in turn would phone the Secretary. It was on one
                    such occasion, I think when some Central American government was unexpectedly
                    overthrown, that Brown told me patiently but firmly that this was the sort of
                    thing that should almost always be decided in the negative. If there was nothing
                    the Secretary could or needed to do in the middle of the night, the lesson was,
                    err on the side caution!</p>
                <p>c. Austria and the Marshall Plan</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That seemed a sensible defense against eager beavers. Were
                        you able to return in your second summer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: No. My second internship, in the summer of 1950, was on the
                    German-Austrian desk in the Economic Cooperation Administration which had been
                    created to administer the Marshall Plan. My job description listed high-flown
                    tasks like evaluating projects for investment guarantees and assisting staff
                    economists on national accounts and balance of payments problems. What I
                    remember was a rather less productive assignment assisting 'Penny', a nice young
                    woman economist, with drafting Congressional letters and other routine tasks she
                    didn't have time to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>As for the larger picture, I never found out, since nobody, in that then
                    hyper-busy crowd seemed interested or willing to explain it to me. So I went
                    back to Harvard that fall with not much to show for my time, except the
                    impression that Eleanor Dulles, busy turning Austria into a ski resort, was a
                    force to be reckoned with and that economics, for the time being, was not my
                    dish.</p>
                <p>The good part of this exceptionally hot summer, during which I lived in a cheap
                    boarding house near Catholic University, was that I came to know some of the
                    bright and dedicated young people then gathering in Georgetown who shared my
                    view that righting the world was our generation's destiny.</p>
                <p>4. Kissinger</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During those Harvard years, did you come to know Henry
                        Kissinger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: We met in various contexts, but I had my first real exposure in William
                    Yandell Elliot's seminar for which Kissinger wrote a huge paper on the early
                    German romantic philosophers. The requirement called for 30-60 pages. Elliot
                    opened the meeting by saying “ I have read Henry's brilliant paper. I don't
                    claim to understand it, but I am sure Henry will explain it to us.” Henry did,
                    droning on for most of two hours about the dense ideas and relationships of
                    various early 19th century German worthies. It was clearly a very learned paper.
                    There was no discussion.</p>
                <p>Henry was approachable but pompous and competitive and contributed much to the
                    repartee in seminars, particularly when he was sparring with Brzezinski. While
                    he had some detractors and made some enemies, he was generally seen as someone
                    likely to become a first class academic. The idea that this young German refugee
                    with an incorrigibly thick accident would become a major world statesman was not
                    yet obvious to any of us - perhaps not even to Prof. Elliott who took him on as
                    his prot�g� after he had blown Harvard College away with an almost straight A
                    average and a 600 page thesis - for which he had earned a rare 'summa cum
                    laude'. He was reportedly so impecunious that in his undergraduate years he only
                    had one pair of pants and so had to stay in bed till they came back from
                    pressing!</p>
                <p>At some point in Henry's graduate career, Elliott steered him away from a purely
                    academic track, encouraging him to write his doctoral thesis on Metternich, thus
                    foreign policy and statesmanship, and then by making him Director of the
                    subsequently famous International Seminar for young foreign leaders at Harvard.
                    The wide range of contacts he made in that capacity and the success of his book
                    on 'Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy' projected him into orbit and
                    history.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>A footnote concerning Elliott's deep disappointment with Kissinger for divorcing
                    his first wife, who had stuck with him loyally through the hard early years at
                    Harvard and beyond and for his increasingly domineering and arrogant behavior as
                    Nixon's National Security Advisor, which he expressed to me in stentorian terms
                    when we ran into each other years later on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington.
                    “That boy” Elliot said angrily as he stomped away “is a disgrace!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with Kissinger after those
                        Harvard years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I had been on fairly friendly terms with Henry in Cambridge. Many years
                    later, when I was working on east-west relations and the NPT in the Political
                    Section of the Embassy in Bonn, he asked me during a brief visit to get in touch
                    with him when I was next in Washington to talk about Germany. I did phone his
                    office that fall, and was told to meet him in New York the following day,
                    November 25 1968. As I was about to leave for the airport, the phone rang and
                    his secretary explained that he had an unexpected conflict.</p>
                <p>I learned later that Henry, who had been working for the Rockefellers, had been
                    called to see Nixon who wanted to make him his National Security Advisor. I
                    often wondered whether Henry would not have brought me along to his NSC staff
                    had the Nixon meeting come a few days later. As it was he never got back to me.
                    I think I was lucky.</p>
                <p>Our only other, indirect, but illuminating meeting was one night at the
                    Ambassador's Residence in Paris during one of Henry's many Paris visits during
                    the Vietnam Peace negotiations, a story I will leave for later in this
                    narrative.</p>
                <p>5. Career decisions</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. So, getting back to your career, what happened after you
                        passed your doctoral orals in 1951?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I began tinkering with a thesis. I had chosen to write on Irving Babbitt,
                    an American conservative under Carl Friedrich, although my heart was never
                    really in it. Partly, the topic was too esoteric (why I chose it remains a
                    mystery!), partly, Friedrich was an advisor in name only, and partly, having had
                    a taste of Washington I really wanted to go back.</p>
                <p>a. Turned down by Truman for being foreign-born.</p>
                <p>In fact the whole doctoral project was almost abandoned before it got underway in
                    1950, when Elliott , who must have thought well of me, asked me one day to go
                    down to Washington to call on Admiral Sidney Souers, who had been the newly
                    created CIA's first Director, and was then Executive Secretary of the recently
                    created National Security Council at the White House under Harry Truman.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>This was very heady stuff. I got my best suit pressed, went down to Washington
                    (those were the days when I still got shivers on my spine when I looked at the
                    national capitol and the flag flying above it), and for the first time ever
                    walked into the White House.</p>
                <p>I found Admiral Souers to be a kind, thoughtful, clearly very effective man who
                    interviewed me at some length. At the end of our meeting he explained to me what
                    my duties would be as his assistant. His role, I remember him emphasizing, was
                    not to run American foreign and security policy! It was simply to provide a
                    setting in which the cabinet members could have proper discussions so that the
                    President would get the best possible advice. Occasionally this required that
                    Admiral Souers would sum things up for him, either orally or in writing, without
                    intruding himself or his staff's views in the process. If appointed, he said, I
                    would help him provide modest secretariat functions, preparing meeting
                    schedules, agendas, occasional briefing papers, etc. Still, a pretty spectacular
                    beginning for a new foreign affairs career!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a very different concept of the NSC staff's role
                        than it has become!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I was about to say that I have often thought about the stark contrast
                    between this very modest original definition of the NSC staff's role and the
                    swollen behemoth it has become. It was clearly not Truman's intent to create a
                    major new bureaucracy to oversee State, Defense, the CIA etc., but only a
                    cabinet-level forum, chaired by the President himself, with perhaps a few
                    subcommittees, to help him pull together the main strands of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To get back to your story, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Ending my interview, which I thought had gone well, Admiral Souers said
                    he was going to talk to the President about this. “I'll give you a ring when I
                    get the answer, but I suspect that all will be well.”</p>
                <p>So with his evidently strong support, I assumed I had managed to land this
                    exceptional job at the highest level and was walking on air - until, two days
                    later Admiral Souers called to say that he was terribly sorry to have to tell me
                    that the President had turned me down! Souers had made a strong case for me, but
                    to no avail.</p>
                <p>I asked “Why?” He said, “Well, the President's only concern was that you are
                    foreign-born, although he read and liked your file and thought that you were
                    otherwise fully qualified. Given his problems in the Congress, the President was
                    worried that he would be attacked for hiring a foreign-born American for this
                    most sensitive position.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even at a relevantly junior level ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I would have been the junior member of a staff of only four or five
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that shows that Truman was already running scared
                        against his Republican critics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: He wanted to avoid creating unnecessary new targets for attack. As for
                    myself, it was quite a sobering experience to be turned down by the President
                    himself for being foreign born - in spite of my military service in World War
                    II. Discrimination clearly was still very much alive in the 1950's!
                    Interestingly, the same thing happened to me again when I first took the Foreign
                    Service Exam, but that's later in our story.</p>
                <p>In spite of this experience I was and remained a great admirer of President
                    Truman. When he made his first major foreign policy speech after a period of
                    rather wounded withdrawal subsequent to leaving office, I wrote him a longish
                    letter of appreciation and support, which included a few cavils and
                    “suggestions”! To my intense surprise I received a wonderful, hand-typed
                    personal letter from him (as evidenced by several typos and corrections) a few
                    weeks later, in which he carefully responded to my various points!</p>
                <p>b. William Yandell Elliott</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about Elliott, who was also my lecturer
                        in my Harvard freshman government class in 1943. He clearly played an
                        important role in getting you and many other of his students into
                        government,</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Elliott, was a powerfully broad-gauged southern intellectual and public
                    servant, a senatorial figure out of central casting and famous, in my time, for
                    his undergraduate survey course of the great Western political figures in which
                    I became his assistant. His weekly segments swept majestically from Plato,
                    Augustine, Luther, Calvin and other major political philosophers, to Karl Marx -
                    and impressed generations of young people with the importance of public service.
                    I remember how, at key points in these famous lectures, he would glare at the
                    several hundred Harvard undergraduates in the auditorium and launch a stentorian
                    challenge: That they must not become another lot of passive bystanders but
                    accept the public responsibilities which a great Harvard education confers! “If
                    you,” he would say, “will not be the leaders of this nation so that bad things
                    do not occur to us, who will be? You have to see to it that these things do not
                    happen in America.” He consistently helped his students find positions in
                    government where they could practice what he had tried to teach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell us a bit more about him and his
                        accomplishments?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Elliott was an extraordinarily multi-faceted man. He was a Rhodes Scholar
                    at Balliol, where he studied under A.D. Lindsay and invented the subsequently
                    banned forward pass for Balliol's Rugby team; an artillery battery commander in
                    World War I; one of the southern 'Fugitive Poets”; author, in the late twenties,
                    of the “Pragmatic Revolt in Politics”, which presciently condemned fascism,
                    syndicalism and communism; and Professor of Government at Berkeley, then Harvard
                    for forty years while commuting to Washington to advise six Presidents.</p>
                <p>Most importantly, he was a Roosevelt brain-truster in the 1930's and 40's and, as
                    we have already said, invented the Bureau of the Budget as a way for FDR to more
                    effectively control his cabinet departments through their purse strings. He was,
                    throughout, a committed internationalist, who foresaw World War II and the Cold
                    War and did his best to prepare the way for American involvement. Indeed we owed
                    much of our World War II supply of rubber, tin, nickel, and molybdenum to his
                    sense of urgency. During the War he became Vice President of the War Production
                    Board in charge of civilian requirements and accompanied Roosevelt to the Yalta
                    Conference, where he warned, presciently but unavailingly, of the oncoming Cold
                    War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. He played a critical wartime role, and even
                        later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: During the Cold War he was an advisor to the National Security Council
                    and later a member of Vice-President Nixon's “Kitchen Cabinet” party which
                    confronted Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in Moscow in 1957. He wrote some
                    speeches for Nixon's 1960 campaign against John F. Kennedy. Had Nixon won, some
                    say that he might have become his National Security Advisor.</p>
                <p>Elliott retired from Harvard in 1964, taught for several years more at American
                    University in Washington, D.C., and eventually retired to his farm in the Blue
                    Ridge mountains. He died in 1974.</p>
                <p>I owe a great deal to the breadth and wisdom of this man who combined deep
                    knowledge of history and political thought with a passion for public service,
                    which he did his best to pass on to all of us.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, since you didn't get the White House job, what
                        happened next?</hi>

                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>JAEGER: I stayed at Harvard during the fall semester of 1950/1951 doing research
                    and assisting Professor Sigmund Neuman, a visiting political scientist, in his
                    'International Politics” course. By April of '51 my civil service appointment to
                    the State Department came through as a member of a special young executives
                    program, called the “Young Officers Group”, assigned to the Office of Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Public Affairs Ed Barrett - a former Dean of the Columbia
                    Journalism School and Newsweek editor.</p>
                <p>The “P” area, as the Assistant Secretary's office was called, in those days
                    reigned over a vast empire, which included not only State's own information
                    activities, i.e. press briefings, public correspondence and the Historical
                    Office, but the huge bureaucracy, of some 10,000 people (later reconstituted as
                    USIA, a separate agency) who carried out America's increasingly intense Cold War
                    information activities through the Voice of America and other operations in
                    Washington and overseas. 'P' was also responsible for providing policy guidance
                    to all concerned, so that our official media and spokespersons would sing from
                    more or less the same page.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did you fit into all of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I was to work for Jesse McKnight, a Special Assistant to the Assistant
                    Secretary who was a key player in 'P's inner sanctum. He liaised with other
                    parts of the Department, represented State on interdepartmental committees, made
                    sure that our media were quick off the mark in reacting to Soviet propaganda
                    initiatives around the globe, had a strong voice in overseeing both staffing and
                    operations, and, I believe, had some hush-hush functions involving American grey
                    or black Cold War propaganda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he a Foreign Service officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: No. Jesse was a former Justice Department civil servant who had moved to
                    State. I found him intimidating at first but discovered that behind his rather
                    forbidding exterior - he was monosyllabic, a bit of a curmudgeon and demanded
                    high standards from himself and others - was an actually very intelligent,
                    committed and caring man. His specialty was to constantly shower the information
                    bureaucracy with little chits assigning tasks, needling them over prompt follow
                    up and sending them sharp reminders when there were lags. I suspect, his most
                    important contribution was the blunt, principled advice he usually gave his
                    superiors, who were under heavy pressures arising from the intensifying Cold War
                    and the strong emotions stirred by the Korean war.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of the other senior people in the front

                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>JAEGER: The one I remember best was Walter Schwinn, a cherubic, literate man who
                    had been Consul General in the Trucial States, sat in on Policy Planning Staff
                    meetings, served as a senior advisor and liaised with the NSC, the OCB and the
                    British on information policy and operations. He later returned to the Middle
                    East and, if I remember correctly, became editor of the Hartford Courant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Typical junior officer chores, particularly in the beginning. Culling
                    masses of current intelligence and operational reports, accompanying or
                    representing McKnight at Operations Coordinating Board meetings, drafting
                    correspondence and memos and, when the Assistant Secretary's Intelligence
                    Advisor was absent, giving the intelligence briefing at Mr. Barrett's large
                    daily staff meeting.</p>
                <p>My first appearance in that role, soon after my arrival, was a disaster. I was
                    called late one afternoon and told that I would be giving the intelligence
                    briefing the following morning and that the cables for my review would be
                    available as of 5 AM! When I arrived at that ungodly hour I found myself staring
                    at a stack of hundreds of messages from all over the world, but had no idea what
                    the key issues were or what the Assistant Secretary was interested in. I began
                    to read and sort, and soon began to panic. When my turn came at the staff
                    meeting to address the twenty-some senior people around the table I simply
                    choked up and couldn't say a word - until someone, after what seemed an
                    eternity, moved the meeting on to the next item.</p>
                <p>I slunk back to my office, utterly ashamed and furious with myself, the one-time
                    debate champion and public speaker, and was convinced my career was at an end -
                    until in mid-afternoon the phone rang. It was Howland Sergeant, the then Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary, who, instead of telling me that I was fired as I expected,
                    asked me to come to see him. He received me with a reassuring smile, said he
                    understood how hard this morning must have been for me, gave me some simple
                    guidelines and asked me to try again a few days later. I did, all went well, and
                    I was mercifully reprieved.</p>
                <p>d. The North Korean atrocities issue</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major substantive issues with which you
                        became involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>JAEGER: We worked on the whole gamut of Cold War propaganda issues, how to
                    respond to shifts and tacks in Soviet tactics and how to handle domestic and
                    international events in our media and on the Voice of America. The latter was
                    often a concern, since their broadcasters, usually passionately involved native
                    speakers, sometimes projected personal views at variance with US policy. In
                    preparing our daily guidances there were also frequent coordination problems
                    with regional bureaus in the Department and other parts of the government, who
                    either did not want some issue to be reported, affecting credibility, or wanted
                    to spin it in ways which would have been counter productive.</p>
                <p>By far the most critical issue I became involved in arose in the OCB
                    sub-committee on Korean war information projects, on which Jesse McKnight
                    represented State. Anxious to increase American domestic support for the war,
                    the Pentagon's Psychological Warfare people proposed putting pamphlets,
                    patterned after Life Magazine, in every American mailbox across the country
                    filled with graphic full page photos of gruesome atrocities allegedly committed
                    by the North Koreans.</p>
                <p>The issue this raised was twofold: Whether it was in the US interest to conduct
                    atrocity propaganda at all? And, even more importantly, whether it was
                    appropriate or legal for the US government to subject the American people to a
                    deliberate propaganda campaign to pump up support for the Korean war.</p>
                <p>Speaking for State, Jesse MacKnight, vigorously opposed this project on both
                    counts in increasingly acrimonious meetings at which the pressures became
                    emotional and personal. The subtext was the same as it has been during the
                    current second Iraq war: That special times justify special methods, and that,
                    if you disagreed, you were unpatriotic, did not support the troops, or
                    worse.</p>
                <p>I substituted for MacKnight at some of these meetings and helped hold the line.
                    In the end, nothing came of this domestic project; although, once the Eisenhower
                    administration was installed, the NSC did, at the Army's Psychological Warfare
                    Branch's behest, approve vigorous overseas and UN campaigns to publicize North
                    Korean atrocities, which were much in the news in that late fall of 1953. [Note:
                    Extensive exchanges on this subject are cited in Senator McCarthy's Executive
                    Session Hearings, published in 2003]. I have always suspected, that it was this
                    issue which eventually led to the final chapter in my relationship with
                    McKnight, when he was suspended without pay on the grounds that his continued
                    employment was inconsistent with national security!</p>
                <p>e. The suspension of Jesse MacKnight.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fascinating. Tell us what happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Well that's actually getting ahead of the story, since I had by then
                    returned to Harvard. In early October 1954, I received a long, shocking letter
                    from Jesse reporting that, on returning from a leave, he was informed that he
                    had been summarily suspended from his job without pay, was under investigation
                    and could no longer even enter the State Department building, where his safe had
                    been sealed and his materials seized - depriving him of the records with which
                    he could vindicate himself.</p>
                <p>He was charged with associating with persons “allegedly sympathetic to the
                    Communist ideology or having records of Communist front activity”; contributing
                    to “alleged administrative failure in the implementation of the Foreign Agents
                    Registration Act; and, to me most interestingly, having in his position and “in
                    connection with his official duties involving the Operations Coordinating Board
                    (!) consistently attempted to obstruct, hamper or nullify plans, proposals or
                    policies designed to prejudice or embarrass the USSR and her satellite
                    nations”.</p>
                <p>MacKnight was, quite obviously, the latest victim of State's new Security Chief
                    Scott McLeod, a former FBI man and staffer for far right-wing New Hampshire
                    Senator Styles Bridges, who had been appointed shortly after Eisenhower came
                    into office to “immunize” the State Department from Senator McCarthy's charges
                    that it harbored people “soft on Communism”: The same man who famously tried to
                    block Chip Bohlen's appointment as Ambassador to Moscow. What role in this
                    affair was played by MacKnight's then boss, Carl McCardle, Dulles' press
                    spokesman and Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, is unclear,
                    although it is hard to imagine that he was unaware.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, the Department itself quickly dropped the third charge
                    concerning his OCB work, since MacKnight's positions had all been carefully
                    cleared within the Department. After some weeks the other charges too were
                    withdrawn, after over a hundred of Jesse's colleagues and friends had submitted
                    affidavits attesting to his loyalty and commitment. I too wrote a strong,
                    detailed paper in his defense, in which I argued vigorously that everything in
                    our relationship led me to believe that he was utterly loyal and deeply
                    dedicated.</p>
                <p>When it became clear that McLeod had no case, MacKnight was reinstated and given
                    a 'finding' that his continued employment at State was “clearly consistent with
                    the interests of national security”. He sent each of us who had written on his
                    behalf a touching letter expressing his gratitude for the support of “so many,
                    many people have shown their decency and understanding”. Eventually he also
                    received an apology of sorts from the then Under Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>Even so, the experience made a permanent hash of MacKnight's life and career,
                    which never really recovered its momentum. He was one of the many victims of the
                    witch hunts of that period, made possible because Eisenhower and Dulles did not
                    adequately protect their staffs from unfounded ideological attacks.</p>

                <p>f. Information policy work and USIA</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those were very troubled times. But let's now get back to
                        you and how you ended up back at Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: My assignment to 'P' had gone through several permutations. When McKnight
                    left for a year at the War College in October 1951, I was moved to 'P's'
                    Information Policy Staff, the small group which prepared and coordinated
                    information policy within and beyond the Department and gave specific guidance
                    to our media.</p>
                <p>After USIA became a separate Agency in 1953, our group became USIA's Information
                    Policy Staff, to which I was seconded and where I continued my work on Eastern
                    Europe, a key area in the cold war. My colleagues and mentors were “Butch”
                    Leveridge, a wise and tested FSO who had served as DCM in Bucharest where he was
                    able to see Soviet 'salami-tactics' at first hand, and Lou Revey, a wonderfully
                    intense, demanding man of Hungarian descent.</p>
                <p>Lou understood Eastern Europe with compelling clarity, wrote incisive, often
                    acerbic memoranda which pushed back against the increasingly hysterical
                    atmosphere in the Dulles years and passionately resisted amateurish projects
                    which would boomerang. This took not only brains but guts in the atmosphere in
                    which we operated.</p>
                <p>In sum, Lou and I (I had became his deputy) fought endless bureaucratic battles
                    similar to the Korean atrocities project I mentioned earlier, on issues like,
                    “Should we have thousands of Bibles dropped secretly over Eastern European
                    countries?” Or “should we have covert distributions of various black and gray
                    propaganda materials here and there?” Lou's principle - which did not endear him
                    to many of the enthusiasts in USIA, the Pentagon and elsewhere, and which taught
                    me a great lesson which I applied again and again in later stages of my work -
                    was that you should never ask or incite people to do things if you're not
                    prepared to back them up.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Exactly, and which, but for Lou Revey, might have come up earlier in
                    other contexts. Our work during this period was an example of the adage that the
                    greatest successes of diplomacy sometimes have to do with things that don't
                    happen, rather than things that do.</p>

                <p>JAEGER: Oh, yes, as did the Eastern European desks in the Department who often
                    helped us resist the zanier projects and hold down the gung-ho enthusiasts. They
                    appreciated good analysis - I still have, for example in my files a memo from
                    Bob McKisson, the then head of Eastern European Affairs at State, commending
                    Revey's analysis of the rise of R�kosi in Hungary and my paper on the 1953 World
                    Peace Congress in Bucharest.</p>

                        isolationists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: They were certainly part of it. But the main factors were Dulles' shift
                    in emphasis from 'containment' to his forward-leaning policy of 'liberation';
                    the increasing stridency of McCarthyism; as well as Washington's anxiety over
                    the fact that the USSR had acquired nuclear weapons. All this produced an
                    over-charged atmosphere which tended to spawn Cold War propaganda projects out
                    of touch with realities behind the Curtain and elsewhere.</p>

                        went with them in '53, what led to the split with State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Since I worked in the Assistant Secretary's office, I had a certain
                    amount of insight into the politics of the split-off.</p>
                <p>The central issues really had to do with money and status. Here were 10,000-some
                    people in the Department's overseas information business who all worked for one
                    Assistant Secretary, whom none could equal or exceed in rank or pay regardless
                    of their actual responsibilities. As a result pressures built up to remedy
                    this.</p>
                <p>In addition, the information staffs had developed a strong sense of
                    organizational and professional identity, which, many felt, was not adequately
                    appreciated or recognized by the State Department - which was seen as
                    paternalistic and uninitiated into the mysteries of psychological manipulation.
                    With the support of senior media executives in New York and elsewhere these
                    pressures gradually prevailed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: There was much debate about the wisdom of the move, particularly since
                    the new USIA was, in many respects feeling its way, and because, as a new
                    cabinet-level agency, it wanted to test the scope of its new independence. So
                    relations with State sometimes became a little tense.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>USIA's first Administrator, Theodore C. Streibert, a media executive who stayed
                    on till 1957, did get things off to a good start, since, in spite of the
                    turbulent times in which he served, he emphasized accurate reporting and
                    credibility. It was this which in the longer run made such an impact behind the
                    Iron Curtain, where the 'radios', VOA, Radio Free Europe and to a lesser extent
                    Radio Liberty, became the lifelines which connected many millions to the to the
                    West.</p>
                <p>Q; Why did they abolish USIA in the end under Clinton?</p>
                <p>JAEGER: The USIA experiment lasted till 1999, when the end of the Cold War
                    undercut the Agency's raison d'etre. So it was folded back into State and
                    dismembered.</p>
                <p>The irony is that the need for effective public diplomacy is now, if anything,
                    greater than ever before, although, as George Allen, USIA's second
                    Administrator, pointed out many years ago, information programs can only be as
                    effective as the quality of the policies they are selling.</p>
                <p>That's why no one has succeeded in making the world like American hegemony as
                    practiced by Bush II, although there has been no lack of trying.</p>
                <p>g. McCarthy's attack on USIA</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have lived through McCarthy's attacks on USIA,
                        the Voice and the US Information Centers abroad? Can you talk about
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: USIA and its senior staff were among his prime targets and put us under
                    growing pressure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which became intense with the Republican takeover of the
                        Senate in '53 when McCarthy assumed the Chairmanship of the Investigating
                        Committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. It was a bizarre and frightening time, partly because
                    McCarthy played to an approving national stage. Even as late as 1954 when his
                    star was already fading, over 50% of the American public still supported what
                    McCarthy had been doing.</p>
                <p>Most people today remember the Army-McCarthy hearings, which proved to be his
                    undoing, and the outrageous antics of his abrasive assistants, Cohn and Shine,
                    in the USIS libraries in Germany, where they removed controversial books and
                    bullied and abused staffs. What is less well remembered is the intensity with
                    which McCarthy pursued USIA's senior staff: Outstanding people like Reed Harris,
                    its first Deputy Administrator, who received a severe going-over memorialized by
                    Edward R. Murrow, and key people who worked on information issues at State, like
                    Harold Vedeler, the distinguished FSO then in charge of Eastern European
                    affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>My own experience was limited to McCarthy's inquisition of our Information Policy
                    Staff which he suspected of being 'soft on Communism' and, perversely, of being,
                    at the same time, insufficiently conversant with Communist ideology to combat it
                    effectively - the accusation leveled against our very able Director Brad
                    Connors! As a result, Connors too became one of the prime targets of the
                    McCarthy hearings. (See Executive Sessions of the Permanent Subcommittee of
                    Investigations of the Senate's Government Operations Committee, published
                    2003)</p>
                <p>I wish I had kept a diary of those critical weeks in early 1953 when, one after
                    another, the senior members of our group and many others from the Voice of
                    America and our Information Services were hauled up before McCarthy's committee,
                    or summoned for private interrogations by Cohn or Shine.</p>
                <p>What does stick in my memory was the Kafkaesque atmosphere of fear which pervaded
                    our meetings during this time as various members were called to testify. When
                    Brad Connors got his summons to appear before McCarthy during a staff meeting he
                    literally fainted. It was like being present when people were reading out
                    execution lists during the French revolution.</p>
                <p>The wide-spread belief was that McCarthy had an informer on our staff who was
                    fingering people, specifically Francis Knight...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of the passport office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: ...who was subsequently reportedly rewarded by being made the powerful,
                    and feared head of State's Passport Office - a job she held past retirement age
                    until she was finally terminated under Jimmy Carter. I remember watching her
                    participating coolly in our meetings while information that she was believed to
                    have passed to McCarthy was being replayed against whoever was up that day
                    before the Grand Inquisitor.</p>
                <p>Not one of them, as far as I know, was ever proven guilty of anything. In
                    retrospect, I had a ringside seat at a historic witch hunt, which, like others
                    before it, damaged many and was a national disgrace. To our own surprise,
                    neither Lou Revey or I were ever called. We did our best to carry on in spite of
                    our demoralized senior echelon.Q: What effect that all this have on you?</p>
                <p>JAEGER: Needless to say, it was a miserable time, which made me increasingly
                    unenthusiastic about spending the rest of my life in Washington, in spite of its
                    many personal attractions.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>For Georgetown at the time was full of extraordinarily bright and interesting
                    young people who shared the vision of our generation that we needed, in one way
                    or another, to help build a better new world. And there were mentors, in my case
                    an extraordinary man to whom I owe much, Charles Burton Marshall.</p>
                <p>h. Charles Burton Marshall and the Policy Planning Staff</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us about him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Burt Marshall was a Harvard Ph.D. who in World War II had served as Port
                    Commander of the Port of Manila, the supply hub for the Pacific, where he
                    established priorities and resolved complex stand-offs between competing
                    interests - important lessons for his later foreign affairs career.</p>
                <p>After the war, he did a stint with the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees,
                    and then, from 1947-1950 served as Staff Consultant and I believe Staff Director
                    for the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where he developed a reputation as a
                    keen thinker and prolific worker and became well-known in Washington. In 1950 he
                    was asked to join Acheson's Policy Planning Staff, which Paul Nitze had just
                    taken over from George Kennan.</p>
                <p>It was sometime in 1951 that we met, I can't recall when or where. Whatever the
                    circumstances, he evidently thought I had some promise and, since I had all the
                    necessary clearances, took me on as a tutee in how foreign policy is and should
                    be made. As a result, we spent many evenings over beer, steak or spaghetti and
                    reviewed the issues which were at that point confronting the Policy Planning
                    Staff until he left in 1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his position or title on the staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: He was just one of the 10 or 12 members. That was the thing that was so
                    amazing and, in retrospect, so important about Acheson's Policy Planning Staff.
                    It was constituted as a group of equals, chosen for their knowledge and good
                    judgement, rather than as a hierarchy of ambitious, competitive people. Among
                    them were people like Louis Halle, who later wrote an important book, still very
                    much worth reading, called “Civilization and Foreign Policy” published by Harper
                    in 1952, which remains a seminal text on the good management of American power.
                    They were searchers rather than ego-trippers. That made all the difference.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>The method they developed was also unique. As Burt Marshall described it, the
                    members would discuss the issue at hand until everybody was on board. The ground
                    rules were that one didn't lose face if one changed one's mind, even if one had
                    argued vigorously for another position. Many of their discussions were genuinely
                    Socratic exercises, quite unusual in bureaucracies.</p>
                <p>The central question they faced were how the United States should respond to the
                    unexpected new threat posed by an aggressive and expansionist Soviet Union in
                    the context of the nuclear weapons now possessed by both sides; and its subsets,
                    how to respond to Soviet pressures in particular contexts. In trying to
                    formulate responses, their discussions inevitably led to questions of
                    definition, i.e. what America's ends should be in this situation, and what means
                    were suitable to reach them. This led them to appreciate that our means should
                    neither exceed or excessively strain our capacities, nor morally damage what we
                    are - in short, that there was an economy of means to consider before defining a
                    major course of action.</p>
                <p>Put another way, they recognized that America was not omnipotent and that there
                    were material, moral and cultural limits to our capacity to conduct our foreign
                    relations. Marshall developed this concept as a Policy Planning Staff paper,
                    which became the basis of his book, “The Limits of Foreign Policy”, published by
                    Henry Holt in 1955. It's still very much worth reading, particularly in the
                    context of the current second Bush Presidency's squandering of American power on
                    ill-defined, open-ended objectives, often using profoundly questionable
                    means.</p>
                <p>Now all this may sound like a verbal exercise, but unless one can answer these
                    basic questions adequately, Marshall often stressed in our meetings, one ran the
                    risk that means would become ends in themselves, or that posited ends would only
                    be vaporous concepts not achievable by any imaginable means. Making the world
                    safe for democracy comes to mind as one example, or, in today's context, the
                    notion of an endlessly undifferentiated 'war on terror'.</p>
                <p>For a young person in Washington, all this was tremendous education. I wrote an
                    enthusiastic review of Halle's book for 'Commonweal', which expounds virtually
                    the same concepts, and tried to apply and preach this basic methodology
                    throughout my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. How did the Policy Planning Staff relate to the NSC and
                        the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>JAEGER: When you look at Harry Truman's biography and Acheson's biographies there
                    are frequent references to the Policy Planning Staff as the place they looked to
                    for thoughtful advice on the major longer-term foreign policy issues facing the
                    country. As a result, there was a certain degree of coherence and clarity about
                    American policy in those early years. We now have a labyrinth of NSC working
                    groups and interdepartmental committees, a process of bureaucratic infighting in
                    pyramids of interdepartmental committees, which rarely produces policies based
                    on the kind of fundamental examination the early Policy Planning Staff's
                    Socratic meetings could achieve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the clarity was not just due to the primary focus on
                        the Soviet problem, but also on the method of working out policy—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about Acheson's role, was he an active
                        participant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Very much so. Although General Marshall had established the Policy
                    Planning Staff, he was not a hands-on manager. It was Acheson, first as his
                    Under Secretary and then as Secretary of State, who developed S/P, to use their
                    in-house initials, turned it into his principal foreign policy think-tank under
                    George Kennan, and made constant use of it by tasking it with issues and
                    questions. The central cluster was, of course, what should be done about the
                    Soviet Union. But there were others, for example one arising from Truman's and
                    Acheson's concern as to how Presidential transition should be handled in the new
                    nuclear age, since previous administrations had no mechanisms to assure foreign
                    policy continuity. The Policy Planning Staff's paper, which Truman much
                    appreciated, proposed the arrangements which have assured effective Presidential
                    transition arrangements in the foreign and security fields ever since.</p>
                <p>But this was only one of dozens of fundamental studies, which the Policy Planning
                    Staff undertook in those years at their own initiative or at Acheson's or
                    Truman's request.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Acheson sit in on any of these meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: As is so often the case, the physical setup was important. Acheson wanted
                    his thank-tank nearby, so assigned them a conference room which shared a back
                    door to his own office. So, between his own meetings, Acheson would often take
                    his coat off, join them or just listen to the discussions under way. It was a
                    synergistic relationship in which Acheson played a key role.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Marshall give you any insights into the differences
                        between Kennan and Nitze?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: When I met Burt Marshall, Kennan had already been succeeded by Paul
                    Nitze. Although Acheson admired Kennan he had grown weary of Kennan's somewhat
                    moralistic, hyper-intellectual approach. While Kennan's 'containment' policy had
                    won general acceptance, Kennan was uncomfortable, as the Cold War ratcheted up,
                    with Washington's growing emphasis on military means. As Kennan's views came to
                    seem more and more unrealistic and out of touch, they created frictions.</p>
                <p>Nitze was the counterpoint, arguing for a strong all-round American response, an
                    outlook Acheson shared and which was reflected in NSC-68, the famous policy
                    paper. Contrary to Kennan's much more nuanced views, it formally defined Soviet
                    intent as world-domination and called for much more activist political,
                    psychological, military and even nuclear containment.</p>
                <p>I came to know Nitze slightly, and remember him with much respect and admiration:
                    He was an elegantly brilliant figure, realistic and hard-headed but
                    intellectually open, a man with remarkable retentive capacity, fluency and range
                    of interests, passionate about the importance of public service.</p>
                <p>His world, in turn, came crashing down, when John Foster Dulles was sworn in as
                    Secretary of State, and Nitze's firm but balanced policies came into conflict
                    with the Eisenhower administration's approach of cutting defense budgets and
                    putting more of the weight of American security on the doctrine of massive
                    retaliation. I remember, as Burt Marshall recounted it at the time, that Nitze
                    came out of Dulles' office on one of his first calls white as a sheet, growling
                    “Either he is insane or I am, and I don't think its me!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was about 'more bang for a buck'!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. Nitze left S/P shortly thereafter, in May 1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nitze was generally thought to be quite hawkish throughout
                        most of his career until perhaps the '80s when he seemed to reverse his
                        position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Perhaps. He always remained clear about America's strategic interests,
                    but became a strong believer in building down the two sides' by then vast
                    nuclear forces and became our leading arms control negotiator. Strobe Talbott
                    has captured this brilliantly in his book on Nitze, “The Master of the Game”,
                    published by Knopf in 1988.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, these were all fascinating experiences. But let's
                        now get back to your career. Here you were in the midst of the McCarthy
                        attacks on USIA trying to do good work on Eastern Europe. What happened
                        next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: By the spring of '54 I decided that I needed a reprieve from the
                    McCarthy-dominated Washington atmosphere (McCarthy had not yet been censured and
                    the Army-McCarthy hearings were still in full swing) and asked Harvard if they
                    would allow me to come back. They promptly agreed, the State Department to which
                    I was still formally attached, granted me a year's leave of absence and, feeling
                    somewhat like a political refugee, I was back in Cambridge by late September as
                    a Resident Tutor and Teaching Fellow, ensconced in a very comfortable
                    oak-paneled suite in Adams House with a working fire place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been pleasant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It was a reassuring experience. Elliott asked me to be one of his
                    assistants in his famous “Political Theory” course which gave me a chance to
                    steep myself in many of the basic texts, from Plato to Marx - a needed
                    refresher, since I had to teach sections of thirty-some students twice a week.
                    Later on I did the same for McGeorge Bundy, the brilliant young Harvard Dean, in
                    his “International Politics” course. Much time was also taken by my duties at
                    Adams House, tutoring students majoring in government, advising on senior theses
                    and joining students and other faculty members around the long polished dining
                    room tables at lunch or dinner, where the daily discussions ranged across the
                    spectrum and were an important part of the undergraduates', and my own further
                    education.</p>
                <p>A few experiences may be worth recording. One involved a young Jordanian tutee,
                    son of a former Prime Minister, a very good student with whom I worked during
                    most of that year. He began to slip in the second semester and was clearly
                    paying the price for carousing. Things came to a head one day, when our meeting
                    went particularly badly, when he stopped, looked at me and said, 'Mr. Jaeger,
                    what I really need to know, does Allah exist? Does he?”. I knew we had come to
                    the crux of the matter, made a difficult decision and said: “Yes”. It was a
                    critical moment and my first direct experience with the corrosive impact of
                    Western culture on Middle Eastern faith, which has caused so much difficulty in
                    our relations over the last decades. We were to meet again many years later when
                    he was Prime minister of Jordan.</p>
                <p>Other tutees were very different, such as the brilliantly febrile Charlie Brower
                    (son of the advertising executive of the same name, who had been the immensely
                    successful President of B.B.D&amp;O) with whom I spent many hours, analyzing and
                    discussing. He later had an impressive legal career, became Acting Legal Advisor
                    at the State Department, a Senior Partner at White and Case and later a Judge at
                    the International Court of Arbitration, but never felt satisfied that he had
                    reached his real potential. Wisdom is the hardest thing to teach.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>And, by way of counter point, there was the tutee who trepidatiously knocked on
                    my Adams House door a few minutes after I had encountered a thoroughly naked
                    young lady retreating down the hallway waving a towel. In 1954 this was still a
                    capital crime, which called for blood and expulsion. His question, “Could I
                    somehow manage not to have noticed?” I was assured that the entire floor would
                    be in my eternal debt, and that none would ever again cause me any trouble. They
                    never did.</p>
                <p>My own affairs were more opaque. Out of the blue an offer arrived from Wesleyan
                    University of an Assistant Professorship in Political Science - a wonderfully
                    generous offer, since one usually started as an Instructor, instigated by Prof.
                    Sigmund Neuman. It forced me to examine my life and to decide what I really
                    wanted to do.</p>
                <p>I came to the conclusion that I really didn't want to be a college professor, but
                    wanted to apply what I had learned in the Foreign Service, even though it would
                    mean coming in at the bottom. The trouble was that one had to be an American
                    citizen for 10 years in order to join. Having been naturalized as a GI during
                    basic training in Alabama in January 1945, I couldn't apply until the spring of
                    '55, which I then promptly did.</p>
                <p>i. Too foreign-born to join the Foreign Service</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did you make out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, I passed the written examination with adequate grades and then went
                    before the Board of Examiners for orals in Boston in November. My examiners
                    turned out to be stereotypical Consul General-types with vests and watch chains
                    who asked questions for over an hour. I got all but two right and thought I was
                    in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what did happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The custom at that time was that the examiners would go into executive
                    session after the interview, had you wait outside and then told you whether you
                    had passed or failed. In my case the chairman came out and said, “Well, Mr.
                    Jaeger, you did splendidly, but you see, we have enough native-born Americans,
                    so we don't need to take foreign-born applicants. The Board has therefore
                    decided against you.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were caught again by your foreign-born status?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. Mercifully things have changed a great deal since then, but
                    its interesting how recently discrimination was still alive and well in the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then, how did you actually get into the Foreign
                        Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: As you can imagine I was outraged and decided to write to Cromwell
                    Riches, the then Executive Director of the Board of Examiners in Washington, to
                    ask for an appointment. After I told him my story, he got out my file and
                    confirmed that I had indeed done “very well” and had been turned down only
                    because I was foreign-born. I said, “Well, Mr. Riches, is that really how
                    America should run its affairs?”</p>
                <p>He gave me a long look and said, “Actually, no. And we're going to do something
                    about that!” He then explained that he couldn't change the board's decision,
                    that I would have to go through the whole exam process a second time, but that
                    he himself would chair the Board before which I would retake my orals. He then
                    added rather emphatically, “My advice is that you have a thorough knowledge of
                    Gunther's Inside USA.” I was a bit mystified, but took the hint and virtually
                    memorized both volumes of this then very popular book in the ensuing months.</p>
                <p>To cut a long story short, I appeared before Cromwell Riches and three other
                    examiners in Washington on March 19, 1956 and fielded esoteric questions for an
                    hour and a half, all of which he had taken directly out of Gunther's Inside USA:
                    Questions like. “What are the chief imports in the port of Galveston in the
                    winter?”, or “Who was the poet laureate of Tennessee in such and such a
                    year?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this to demonstrate to the other members of the board
                        that you knew America so well, that being foreign-born didn't matter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. I was challenged by another board member on only one answer
                    involving the author of a particular poem. Riches intervened and said, “I looked
                    this up before I asked the question. The candidate is right!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ouch!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: When it was all over Mr. Riches simply looked right and left and he said,
                    “There is no question, is there, my colleagues, that this foreign-born American
                    should be a member of the Foreign Service?” Everybody nodded. And that's how I
                    got it in.</p>
                <p>It took a bit of smoke and mirrors, but it got me there.</p>
                <p>Part III: Early years: Consular training, the Estimates Group and Liberia</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now let's talk about your new life in the Foreign
                        Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, it began with a bit of a setback, since I was appointed as an
                    FSO-6, but, because of a short delay to take a vacation, unexpectedly fell under
                    a new law restructuring the Foreign Service and so was sworn in in July 1956 as
                    an FSO-8!</p>
                <p>1. The Consular Course</p>
                <p>JAEGER: Be that as it may, some twenty of us reported full of high expectations
                    for Basic Officers Training, a course then housed in a rather run-down four
                    story brownstone building on C Street, where the present State Department
                    building is now located. Each of us was given an old-fashioned school desk
                    surrounded by dark stains, the sweat of earlier generations of young FSOs who
                    had sat there through stifling hot Washington summers before us!</p>
                <p>We were all very excited about starting our new careers, even though the training
                    turned out to be pedestrian. First came some broad-brush weeks on State
                    Department organization and history, with lots of dull charts and tables of
                    organization. Then came the famous basic consular course, a six-week effort to
                    teach us consular law and practice, since most of us were expected to start as
                    consular officers. It droned on through the hot summer, and was less a learning
                    experience than an endurance test. Consular law was still strict in those days,
                    and it was impressed on us that we would judge, in light of the 600-some pages
                    of consistently inconsistent Immigration law, who would make the grade and got
                    visas and who would not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Normally FSI is thought of in terms of foreign language
                        courses.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: They do that too, of course. The thing I found most interesting was that
                    in this introductory course there was no mention, as far as I can remember, of
                    either foreign affairs or the policy making process. There were talks on
                    practical issues like security, efficiency reports, per diem, travel
                    arrangements etc. which were useful. But a visiting outsider asking how America
                    trained its incoming diplomats would have been amused and disappointed at the
                    lack of substantive discussion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It reminds me of how the navy taught me to be a
                        paymaster.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Even so, it was an important experience, in which many of us bonded and
                    all of us assumed our new Foreign Service identity. The people I remember most
                    clearly were Tom Hirschfeld - a clear, and witty thinker who, to the distress of
                    some subsequent superiors had a disconcerting tendency to go to the heart of the
                    matter - with whom I later served in Germany, and who, with his lovely wife
                    Hannah, has remained a lifelong friend. There was Doug Hartley, always positive
                    and sane, who too has continued to stay in touch.</p>
                <p>Another was Jay Peter Moffat, the gifted, rather aristocratic son of a former
                    Under Secretary famous for opposing the liberalization of immigration law which
                    would have permitted Jews to escape Nazi Germany. Peter, as he was called,
                    genuinely liked me, introduced me to the concept of 'A' and 'B' social lists
                    when giving a party, and once said to me earnestly that it was too bad that,
                    even though I was brighter than he, he would become an Ambassador before me
                    because of his better connections. He was right.</p>
                <p>Then there was quiet and reserved Jack Matlock, the brightest and most
                    hard-working of all of us, who later became famous as Ambassador in Moscow
                    during the Gorbachev/Yeltsin period; as well as Peter Lord and Everett Briggs,
                    both destined to become heavy hitters.</p>
                <p>2. The Estimates Group</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did they hand out your first assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The great moment came at the end of the summer. For me it was not a
                    surprise, since, throughout that spring and summer, I had been in touch with
                    Allan Evans, the third-ranking officer in the State Department's then huge
                    Bureau of Intelligence and Research in charge of 500-some researchers and
                    analysts, organized, like the State Department itself, into major regional and
                    functional offices.</p>
                <p>Evans had suggested, while I was still at Harvard, that I join his office as a
                    mid-level civil servant, to serve as Secretary to the Estimates Group,
                    succeeding Henry Owen, an already rather renowned senior figure who was about to
                    move on to the Policy Planning Staff. He later became a Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary for Economic Affairs, and still later served in the White House. When
                    I made my choice to become a career Foreign Service Officer Allan Evans
                    nevertheless accepted this kindly and had me brought in as an FSO-8! This was an
                    additional challenge for me, since I had to prove myself in a quite senior
                    assignment, replacing a very respected official at the top of the civil service
                    scale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Tell us about Allan Evans, he sounds unusual.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>JAEGER: He was. Allan Evans was originally English, had during the war been
                    seconded to the OSS in London in a senior liaison capacity, became an American
                    citizen after the war and was brought over into the State Department as the
                    number-three man in INR in charge of the hundreds of research analysts who had
                    been brought in when OSS was dissolved. He was an urbane, widely read, utterly
                    civilized man, who ran his research empire with a bemused touch and a misleading
                    air of seeming absent-mindedness. Evans clearly understood that good policy
                    judgement had to rest on incisive analysis. His primary effort therefore was to
                    make sure that happened, which is where the Estimates Group came in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what did the Estimates Group do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The Estimates Group was the committee of INR's regional and functional
                    Office Directors (the people in charge of the various research branches, like
                    the Middle East, Europe, the USSR or Economic issues) which Evans had created to
                    vet the State Department's contributions to National or Special Intelligence
                    Estimates. NIEs and SNIEs, then as now, were the coordinated judgments of the
                    entire intelligence Community based on each agency's written contributions.
                    Subjects ranged across the spectrum, from the annual NIE on the USSR, to NIE's
                    on regional trends and individual countries. SNIs were the special estimates on
                    faster-moving crisis situations.</p>
                <p>The system Allan Evans developed to assure that INR produced sound, airtight
                    analyses was bureaucratically unique and, I thought, very effective. Each NIE
                    draft contribution, for example a country paper on Egypt, was distributed to and
                    studied by all the other Office Directors and then discussed when they met as a
                    body in an Estimates Group meeting, chaired by Allan Evans.</p>
                <p>My rather perilous and exciting job was to be the front office gadfly at these
                    meetings, because Allan Evans didn't want to ask all the nasty questions of the
                    senior members of his staff. The idea was not to flatter the authors, but to
                    critique and ask pointed, sometimes painful questions, to see if the draft was
                    comprehensive and could stand up to critical analysis. If it did it was sent on
                    to the CIA as the State contribution. If not, and that was often the case as a
                    result of these meetings, which usually occurred twice, even three times a week,
                    they were amended and sometimes even completely rewritten.</p>
                <p>The reason this made not only substantive but bureaucratic sense and produced no
                    enmities, was that all the Office Directors subjected each other to this
                    process, no one was singled out, and all agreed that it greatly improved the
                    result. The point was to make sure that the State Department's contribution
                    didn't simply replay the pet themes of some particular analyst or Office
                    Director in INR, but represented a balanced and coherent view.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Walk us through the process from the start to the finished
                        NIE.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Some NIE's were ordered by the White House, some requested by one of the
                    agencies in the Intelligence Community, some were periodic, like the Soviet
                    estimate, which was done on an annual basis. A calendar was established by the
                    CIA, determining when contributions from all agencies were due. Then drafts
                    would be prepared around town, in our case in the appropriate office of INR,
                    which was then vetted through the Estimates Group as we just discussed and
                    submitted to the Agency.</p>
                <p>CIA's analysts would then incorporate all this material, including its own
                    contribution, into a composite draft NIE which would be reviewed at one or more
                    inter-agency meetings at which everyone was represented. When, as was often the
                    case, there were differences, i.e. between State and Army or the CIA, they were
                    either reconciled or, if that proved impossible, the dissenting agency or
                    Department would “take a foot note”, indicating that it did not agree with this
                    or that judgement and why. This put policy makers reading the NIE on notice that
                    there were differences of opinion. In some cases these footnoted judgments were
                    important red flags involving major issues.</p>
                <p>All this was of course an absolutely fabulous education, although, being very
                    junior, my role as the institutional gadfly was frequently delicate. I somehow
                    managed it, nevertheless, without making permanent enemies of the powerful
                    division chiefs. The ones I liked and admired most were Phil Habib, later of
                    Saigon-fame, Ed Doherty, a wonderful Irish intellectual who was a kind and
                    generous mentor, and the brilliant and incisive Charlton Ogburn, who, after he
                    left State, wrote “The Marauders”, a best-seller on his combat experiences in
                    Burma and a series of books on the authorship of Shakespeare's plays which
                    attracted wide interest. His account of his travels along the north eastern
                    shore in “The Winter Beach” is considered a classic of nature-writing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do any of these NIE's stand out in your
                        recollections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, the urgent Sputnik SNIE of 1957, after the Russians had put their
                    first satellite in orbit - a breakthrough which had come as quite a shock to the
                    American government and public.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, Allan Evans asked me to coordinate and be one of the coauthors of
                    the State Department's contribution. The general line was that America, because
                    of budget cuts, lassitude and educational problems, had fallen behind the curve;
                    that the Russians had stolen a march on us; that this was having, and would
                    have, a considerable adverse propaganda effect throughout the world which would
                    affect perceptions of the US in the cold war, and that, in effect, we needed to
                    pull up our socks.</p>
                <p>We thought that was an unexceptionable and correct position. So did most of our
                    colleagues in the CIA whose contribution ran along similar lines, until Allen
                    Dulles, the then CIA Director, took the preliminary draft to President
                    Eisenhower. According to then accounts Eisenhower went through the roof and
                    asked Dulles to have the SNIE toned down significantly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eisenhower objected to crediting the Russians with any
                        such lead?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: He clearly wanted a less exciting paper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there already was much excitement in the press and
                        Congress!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Of course. Perhaps Ike didn't want to add unnecessarily to the hysteria
                    or was less alarmed because he may have been confident that we would soon catch
                    up and surpass the Soviets, as we did with 'Explorer' in 1958.</p>
                <p>Be that as it may, what I recall was that there were two successive meetings with
                    Allen Dulles to which I was taken along by Allan Evans and another colleague. At
                    the first, in the Old Brewery in Washington, Allen Dulles asked whether the
                    people responsible for this paper would agree to tone it down as the President
                    had requested. No one agreed. I remember Allen Dulles sitting there, puffing his
                    pipe, and glaring at us. Everybody was fidgeting and was, of course, extremely
                    uncomfortable. The best he could get was an agreement to make a few minor
                    editorial revisions, which wouldn't really change the thrust of the paper.</p>
                <p>Shortly thereafter there was a second meeting at a secure site, I think in New
                    Jersey, at which the slightly revised version of paper was on the agenda,. We
                    landed in a helicopter on a golf course surrounded by guards with Tommy guns and
                    met in the country club. When the SNIE came up we went through pretty much the
                    same scenario. It was one of those exceptional times when the working folks in
                    the government stood their ground. Although somewhat lower key in tone, the
                    final SNIE stuck to its guns - judgments which were important in providing the
                    intelligence basis for accelerating our technological and educational efforts in
                    this country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the Sputnik estimate made a major
                        contribution to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>JAEGER: I think it played a role. Those who wanted to save defense dollars would
                    have preferred something that said, “Look, this is a just blip on the landscape,
                    a Soviet PR exercise, which doesn't really mean very much.” What this paper
                    deprived them of was the ability to add, “and the intelligence community agrees
                    with us.” They could still make the argument, but they couldn't claim to base
                    themselves on our best collective judgment. It was all very heady stuff for an
                    FSO-8!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of estimates, what about the reaction to the
                        Hungarian and Suez crises in the fall of '56?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That happened when I was just getting my feet wet, so my memory is a bit
                    hazy, except that there were very intense discussions. One of the concepts was
                    Habib's “mattress theory of the Middle East”, the idea that if you push down on
                    one end it will pop up on the other. While not very scientific, I still think of
                    it occasionally as the Middle East goes through successive action/reaction
                    cycles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any other subjects on which NIEs were
                        prepared?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: There were many: On the state and likelihood of further nuclear
                    proliferation, on various regional political and economic trends, i.e. the
                    prospects for military dictatorship Latin America and estimates on many
                    individual countries. I remember being asked to take the lead on a SNIE on
                    Antarctica, which I helped launch, contributed to and guided through the
                    process. I still have a letter of commendation from the then head of the Bureau
                    of Intelligence and Research, Hugh Cummings, on this work. Last, but far from
                    least, was the major annual NIE on the Soviet Union, which absorbed a great deal
                    of our energy. Some of these SNIEs and NIE's have been declassified and can now
                    be studied with the benefit of hindsight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quite an experience for a first assignment!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: For me it was all fascinating, multifaceted work, which stretched me. I
                    was pretty good at analyzing logical sequences and finding gaps in accounts and
                    arguments, or playing devil's advocate for some proposition not dealt with in a
                    draft, but had as yet had no direct experience in any of the places we
                    discussed.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>In retrospect, I have learned how important it is to understand countries not
                    only in the abstract but from the “inside”, and wonder how naive I must have
                    seemed to some of my much more experienced colleagues. Even so they were
                    consistently tolerant of my sometimes very persistent probing. Officialdom also
                    seemed satisfied and I received my first promotion to the exalted level of FSO-7
                    in March of 1958! When I left INR that summer Allan Evans sent me one of the
                    kindest and most appreciative letters I have ever received, thanking me for my
                    work with him. He was a gentleman, a scholar and a kindly prince.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question before we move on. What happened to INR
                        institutionally since then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Over the years, the intelligence side of the State Department was cut
                    back to its present modest size through successive budget cuts. While this saved
                    money, it represented a huge loss of institutional memory, since the hundreds of
                    civil servants who staffed it in those post-war years were sometimes rumpled,
                    crotchety or odd, but, for all that, highly qualified academics and specialists
                    inherited from wartime agencies. They had collectively watched and could recall
                    the ins and out of every corner of the globe, either from memory or because they
                    had squirreled away the information in their many bulging file cabinets. The
                    State Department's other bureaus necessarily had a much shorter memory span,
                    since the FSO's who staffed them were moved in and out of country assignments
                    every two to four years. As INR shrank, its memory base disappeared
                    proportionally, although it did preserve a tradition of taking the longer
                    view.</p>
                <p>That this can be crucial was again shown in INR's recent dissents from
                    intelligence community judgments claiming Saddam Hussein was building weapons of
                    mass destruction which erroneously helped to justify the second Iraq war.</p>
                <p>3. Liberia</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go from INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In July of 1958 my phone rang one day and someone from Personnel said, “Well, Mr.
                    Jaeger, you seem to have done okay in your first assignment, but we have the
                    feeling you've so far been looking at the Foreign Service from one end of the
                    telescope. We thought that your next assignment should give you a chance to see
                    it through the other.”</p>
                <p>“Well, what do you have in mind?”, I said, thinking we were now starting an
                    urbane negotiation. “Actually I am calling to tell you “, he said, “that you
                    have been assigned as Third Secretary of Embassy for Commercial Affairs in
                    Monrovia, Liberia!” I blurted out, “Where on earth is that?”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The guy said, “Well, you need to find out, that's one of the reasons
                    you're going there. You're to report there in three weeks.”</p>
                <p>Needless to say that was a bit more of a shock than a surprise, since my
                    Washington career had so far been in relatively high- level jobs and I had
                    somehow developed the idea that things would simply continue that way. The
                    notion of being a 'third' secretary in a country I could only place vaguely as
                    being somewhere on the west-African coast, did not fit these expectations. I was
                    to learn within a matter weeks that the Personnel people in fact had it
                    absolutely right: First, because up to that point I had no idea what the bread
                    and butter work in the Foreign Service was all about and had much to learn; and
                    secondly, because, as it turned out, Liberia was to be one of the most important
                    experience of my life and a place which, to my great surprise, I came to
                    love.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left the comforts of Washington for the trenches on
                        the equator.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right, although this first involved getting properly equipped. The
                    key to any degree of success in Monrovia, I discovered was being properly
                    dressed, - which in those days, when William Vacanarat Shadrach Tubman was still
                    President, meant the 'works': White tie, black tie, morning coat, white gloves,
                    spats, and of course a sturdy collapsible topper, all of which one acquired at
                    S.S.S. Schwartz, the famous Foreign Service haberdasher in a Baltimore loft who
                    has clothed generations of FSO's for their assignments across the globe.</p>
                <p>When, after some searching, I found their establishment, one of the three
                    Schwartz brothers promptly told me to stand on a wooden box, asked where I was
                    going and shouted to some assistants across many racks of clothing, “Monrovia”!
                    The needed accoutrements appeared in succession from various corners of the
                    loft, Mr. Schwartz fitted me with incisive expertise, told me that George Kennan
                    had been there just a short time ago, congratulated me and wished me luck.</p>
                <p>When I had completed my next purchase, a used black two-door Ford, which I had
                    fitted with extra-heavy springs to withstand what I had been told were Liberia's
                    abominable roads, and had consigned my modest worldly goods to the shipping
                    company, I was set to go.</p>
                <p>a. Leaving Washington</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>This first overseas trip since I had returned from Europe at the end of World War
                    II was an exciting prospect, although it meant leaving behind not only my, by
                    now elderly, parents in Kansas City, but an intense and happy social life in
                    Washington. Georgetown in the '50s was full of interesting people, who, to a
                    much greater extent than I experienced in later years, seemed seriously
                    dedicated to solving world problems and shared a sense of personal commitment
                    which often transcended careers.</p>
                <p>Among them were my old Harvard roommate Frank Keenan, now a liberal Republican
                    staffer on the Hill, and his lovely new wife Joan; Guy Wiggins, an elegantly
                    rakish and witty fellow-FSO who later, following in his father's and
                    grandfather's footsteps became an accomplished painter; Larry Carp, a young
                    lawyer who had served briefly in the State Department, become Associate Counsel
                    of the Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights in '56 and then went on to a
                    very successful career as an immigration lawyer in St. Louis, and a lifetime of
                    passionately boosting and contributing to the UN - most recently as a Public
                    Member of the US Delegation; urbane and somewhat older Jeff Kitchen, involved, I
                    always thought, in less visible government activities, and his brilliant wife,
                    who ran a magazine on Africa and brought us in contact with some later famous
                    African leaders like young, idealistic Julius Nyerere; and Peter Warker, my
                    housemate at Mary Crook's on Legation Street, also in the Foreign Service, who
                    would go on to a career as an Eastern European specialist and later worked in
                    several private corporations.</p>
                <p>b. Sadako Ogata</p>
                <p>Last, but far from least among our Georgetown group was Sadako Nakamura, later
                    Sadako Ogata, the recently famous head of the United Nations Refugee
                    Organization, admired for her indefatigable efforts on behalf of millions of
                    refugees in the first Iraq war, the Bosnian war and during a multiplicity of
                    other concurrent dreadful crises.</p>
                <p>The Sadako we knew in those earlier years was a lovely, keenly interested,
                    hardworking young Japanese graduate student at Georgetown, whose modesty and
                    humor concealed that she was the granddaughter of a former Japanese Prime
                    Minister, a member of Japan's aristocracy and had, from childhood had a ringside
                    seat at the cascade of events which ultimately led the Japanese to total
                    disaster.</p>
                <p>I came to know 'Sada' well, was very fond of her, and much admired her fierce
                    dedication to clear thinking about international problems and quiet
                    determination to be of service to humanity. It's one of the wonderful things
                    about following people's careers, that, some actually achieve what they set out
                    to do. My wife Pat and I met her again fifty years later over dinner in New
                    York, after she had retired from the UN. Although now an elder statesperson,
                    somewhat bent, her face marked by years of long and difficult service, she was
                    still battling on, speaking of the book she had written on her years at UNHCR
                    and the new projects and commitments she was undertaking, for Japan and the
                    UN.</p>

                <p>c. Off to Monrovia</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went off to Monrovia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, in September 1958. Getting there was an experience in itself, since
                    I crossed the Atlantic on a Pan American Clipper which took off from the East
                    River in New York, stopped some 18 hours later in the Azores and eventually got
                    to Lisbon. It was the first and last time I really enjoyed a commercial flight.
                    The plane had commodious seats, which, at night transformed into full-length
                    double decked bunks, as in a Pullman car; excellent meals were prepared by an
                    onboard cook and served on crisply pressed linen table cloths in genuine china
                    with silverware. When dinner and 'digestives' were finished the stewardesses
                    made up our bunks, which had curtains so that you could put on pajamas, stretch
                    out and get a good nights sleep. I still remember that, just before I dozed off
                    in a cozy upper, a hand pulled my curtain aside a bit and, as a last nice touch,
                    a voice asked what I would like for a nightcap? I recall a very satisfying
                    vintage Cognac!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: After Lisbon, life got real on Pan Am's long, much more basic, but
                    equally memorable flight across the West African Sahara and the Sahel to Roberts
                    Field in Liberia; which had been built by the US in 1942 and 1943 as part of a
                    backdoor route, via Brazil, to ferry supplies and troops to the North African
                    campaign. Together with the Port of Monrovia, Roberts Field and the 5000-some US
                    troops based in Liberia at the time, also assured access to Liberia's huge
                    rubber resources, primarily at the Firestone plantation, which were critically
                    important in World War II as well.</p>
                <p>On our flight I had my first encounter with a cross-section of Africa's colorful
                    traveling public - weary-looking Lebanese traders, some returning European
                    business people, marked by years of living in the tropics, and all sorts of
                    African men and women in a variety of striking robes and headgear speaking a
                    multiplicity of languages. It was also an impressive introduction to West
                    Africa's very different climate, since we passed through immense thunderclouds
                    over the Sahara which shook our plane like a butterfly in the wind and left us
                    all very glad when we finally landed safely at Roberts Field! And that, in spite
                    of the unkempt air of its wet, desolate-looking landing strip carved out of the
                    bush, the pathetic little hut which was the only airport building and the
                    several snakes I noticed then and later under the benches in the small,
                    stiflingly hot waiting room. Whether or not they were deadly mambas has remained
                    unclear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like quite a trip!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, it was the transition from one world to another. Waiting for me in
                    the grey rainy season drizzle, was Bill Rush - my rumpled-looking new boss, the
                    head of the Embassy's two-man economic section of which I was to be the junior
                    member - who bundled me into a black Embassy car for the 20 mile drive on
                    unpaved laterite roads into Monrovia.</p>
                <p>I don't remember much of our conversation because I was so astonished by the
                    succession of native Liberian villages we passed, which, with their thatched
                    huts set in palm groves, bare-breasted women and naked children, looked just
                    like New Yorker cartoons. The experience was rounded out by village men,
                    suffering from schistosomiasis and therefore urinating frequently, simply
                    turning in our direction, so as not to miss the passing show, and spraying
                    away.</p>
                <p>Needless to say, by the time we arrived at the Embassy compound and Bill got me
                    settled down in the quite comfortable house I was to share with Bob Allen, the
                    Political Officer, I had a first-rate case of culture shock! It was during a
                    little reception which had been arranged to welcome me that Bill Rush memorably
                    recognized the symptoms and said: “Actually George, you look like a rabbit.
                    We'll have to see what we can do with you.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Not, I thought, a very good beginning!</p>
                <p>d. Learning about WAWA: Crashed fire engines and sinkingships</p>
                <p>Over my first weekend I ventured out to explore downtown Monrovia, at the time a
                    depressing scene of badly maintained buildings, rusting corrugated roofs and
                    potholed streets.</p>
                <p>As I stood at the main intersection, wondering which way to head next, I suddenly
                    heard what I thought were two fire engines. When I saw them, coming up the left
                    and right sides of the same block on whose corner I was standing, I realized
                    that they couldn't see each other, but were heading straight toward my corner
                    where they were going to meet. I thought: “No, they're not going to do this!
                    They are not going to do this!” But, they did! They totaled each other in front
                    of me, sirens still going!</p>
                <p>Next day, Monday, I attended my first staff meeting, and was welcomed by
                    Ambassador Richard Lee Jones, a mild, friendly African-American who had been a
                    Chicago department store executive, and one of the few black brigadier generals
                    in the US Army during World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to interject, were there other blacks in the Embassy
                        staff at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Only the Public Affairs officer, a tall, competent, very nice man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, continue the story about this first staff
                        meeting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Everyone around the table made some report. When my turn came, having
                    just arrived, it was assumed that I would just briefly say how pleased I was to
                    be there. Instead I spoke up and said, “Well, I do have something to report,
                    that is that I took a walk downtown yesterday and saw two fire engines, both
                    pretty new, which totaled each other coming at speed from two sides of the same
                    block.”</p>
                <p>The Ambassador just said, “Oh my God!”</p>
                <p>I then learned that these fire engines had only a few weeks earlier arrived from
                    the States and been ceremoniously turned over as a present to President Tubman.
                    I had witnessed their virgin call to duty - with its disastrous results!</p>
                <p>The next event was even more unnerving. Only a few days or so later was to be the
                    great ceremonial launch of the first Liberian-built and owned cargo ship at a
                    dry dock on the Mesurado River, a project specially dear to President Tubman.
                    Although Liberia's flag vessels were crisscrossing the oceans, and so brought in
                    a certain amount of income, up to that point not even one ship was actually
                    owned by Liberia, much less constructed there. This launch was intended to
                    remedy that and show the world that Liberia had the potential to become a real,
                    albeit small part, part of the maritime scene.</p>
                <p>Be that as it may, everybody who was anybody in the country was in the reviewing
                    stand that sweltering day; the band struck up the national anthem, “The Love of
                    Liberty brought us here”; Liberian flags did their best to flutter slightly in
                    the stifling heat; and the huge wooden ship began to slip sideways toward the
                    river after Mrs. Antoinette Tubman had vigorously swung the bottle and
                    christened it.</p>
                <p>Then everyone sucked in their breaths. For the ship slid and slid and kept on
                    sliding - until it hit the water and began to sink! At first no one could
                    believe their eyes. But there it was, the few sailors on board had jumped off
                    into the dirty river, pretty soon the deck began to disappear, then the bridge
                    went under, until, with a final shudder and a huge belch, the smokestack
                    vanished under the lazy brown-green flow! There was a deathly silence, only
                    punctured by the oinking of some frogs, until, after what seemed like an
                    eternity, Tubman rose slowly and walked out.</p>
                <p>What had happened was that the inexperienced shipwrights had indeed built a
                    lovely ship, but had used heavy hard woods, abundant in Liberia, and then
                    compounded the problem by fitting the vessel with a set of heavy engines. The
                    'Antoinette Tubman' never had a chance.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>The Westerners that week made mostly snide comments and chattered about “WAWA”
                    (”West Africa wins again!”), although, as I came to understand, there was
                    poignancy in these often failed and even ludicrous attempts to bring Liberia up
                    to Western standards: The result either of inadequate preparation and training,
                    or, more often, a consequence of the deep cultural differences between our
                    societies which frequently produced wholly unexpected reactions or results.</p>
                <p>It was on this instructive note that my assignment in Liberia began.</p>
                <p>e. First trips upcountry</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the next lessons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I was to learn over the coming months that Bill Rush was a very bright
                    guy and a pretty good economist, but that, most importantly, he had come to
                    understand that you didn't learn much of any importance in West Africa by
                    hanging around the Embassy social circuit - then, as probably now, a
                    hyper-active cultural defense mechanism against the real and imagined risks of
                    actually getting involved in Africa.</p>
                <p>Instead he believed in going out into the bush as often as we could, meeting
                    chiefs, missionaries, district commissioners, traders and our own economic
                    development people at work in the up-country areas, as well as ordinary
                    Africans. As a result we came to understand the country and its problems, were
                    better able to advise on what might or might not work, and often scooped the
                    folks who stayed in town following the rumor mill. Bill's tough love, hands-on
                    training was a tremendous lesson on how, in principle, good reporting and
                    analysis should be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Rush start you off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, at the outset I understood none of that, and was therefore
                    intensely surprised when, on the second weekend after my arrival, Bill stopped
                    by my desk and announced that “we are leaving at eight tomorrow to go
                    up-country. Try to be on time and have your gear ready for an overnight” !</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>I felt too intimidated to ask where we were going or why, but was ready with a
                    little pack at the appointed time, piled into our jeep and set off. Bill drove
                    about hundred miles north towards Gbarnga on a terribly potholed and rutted
                    laterite road, passing village after village - with their palaver huts, topless
                    women pounding cassava, naked children and more and more forlorn-looking
                    Lebanese traders the farther north one went - stopping only occasionally to call
                    on someone, and then continuing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's laterite?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It's reddish dirt, prevalent in most of Liberia - red because of its high
                    iron ore content.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: None of this helped much with my culture shock and growing confusion as
                    to what, less than two weeks out of Georgetown, I was doing in this god-forsaken
                    wilderness! To make things worse, it was beginning to get dark. Being the new
                    junior, and trying to get an idea what the plan was, I said, “You know, Bill, I
                    haven't made any reservations (!). Where do you think we should stay tonight?”
                    He burst out laughing, and allowed as to how as yet he hadn't figured that out
                    either, but added cheerfully “Let's see what we can do.”</p>
                <p>So, a few miles on, he turned into a sketchy path which eventually led to a
                    village where Bill asked for the chief. When we found him in the palaver hut,
                    (an airy thatch-roofed structure found in most villages where the men discuss
                    policy issues and hang out while the women pound cassava and do most of the
                    other work) Bill told him that we needed a place to stay and wondered, pointing
                    suggestively to some gin we had brought along, “if we could also have a little
                    party”.</p>
                <p>All this seemed very agreeable to the chief; some topless ladies were promptly
                    dispatched to sweep out a hut (the Maidenform bra was to appear in Liberia only
                    in the following year); a tom-tom sounded just as in the movies to summon people
                    to the celebration; and we were soon installed in our new mud-walled, utterly
                    bare home - with people of all ages crowding the empty window frames to watch us
                    unpack our kits.</p>
                <p>Actually, we got off rather lightly that night, since on another occasion, still
                    farther in the interior, a big menacing growl went up from the onlookers in the
                    windows as we began eating the food we always brought along; which, it was
                    explained by a youngster who knew some English, expressed their shock that we
                    didn't wash before eating - as “Africans always do!”.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>We, of course, offered to do so, and soon saw an amply endowed woman set down a
                    little wooden board outside our hut, followed by a steaming enamel basin of hot
                    water, both clearly meant to be used for our wash. So we went out, stood on the
                    board, washed hands and faces, smiled all round and went back to try to eat.</p>
                <p>No way! There were more, and more menacing growls, growing quickly louder. What
                    was required, we were told, and what all people from that village did when they
                    came in from the bush, was that we strip and let the nice woman wash us
                    properly!</p>
                <p>Bill, shaking with laughter, suggested that I go first. So I shed my clothes,
                    stood on the board and grimly determined to let myself be cleansed, as a circle
                    of intensely interested young onlookers of both sexes pressed in closer and
                    closer to get a good look at all aspects of this amazing white phenomenon. My
                    turn to laugh came moments later when it was Bill's turn to strip tease!</p>
                <p>My experience on our first upcountry trip was less taxing. A big fire was started
                    in the village center as we were eating our rations and, after a while, more and
                    more women began chanting and dancing around it, to the stirring beat of the
                    'big' drums which sounded out over great distances, and the staccato cross
                    rhythms of the smaller ones - some set on the ground, others held under the arms
                    of the village musicians.</p>
                <p>As the gin and palm wine made the rounds, the dancers' movements became more
                    hypnotic, and they began to glow and glisten in the fire light as they danced
                    and danced till the wee hours of the morning! Listening to the chanting and the
                    pounding drums reach out across the vast dark night sky and the endless African
                    bush all around us, was a deeply moving, humanizing experience, which on our
                    many later trips I came to love. It is an amazing discovery when one comes to
                    understand that these people, so much closer culturally to the stone age, are as
                    essentially human as we are, and, like us, have constructed belief systems,
                    reflected in ceremonies, music and art, to explain the mystery of what and where
                    we are.</p>
                <p>Exciting as all this was, my first night in the bush nevertheless became rather
                    harrowing. We slept, or rather tried to sleep, in hammocks which we had hung up
                    on the hut's wooden rafters, although rats kept trying to make it down the
                    ropes, mosquitos and other insects buzzed around our nets, and the chief sent
                    around two of his wives, in a well-meant offer, which we gratefully
                    declined!</p>
                <p>The next day, as we drank the coffee we had made, I realized that I had in fact
                    survived - and overcome my fears! That, of course was Bill's point, and from
                    then on I began to enjoy and savor my new life of exploring and coming to
                    understand this complex and fascinating African country. By quickly getting me
                    over my instinctive anxieties about Africa, Bill had done me a huge favor which
                    made my assignment in Liberia one of the best in my career.</p>

                <p>f. Reporting on Liberia</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. What did you work on on these upcountry trips?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: We would focus on the state of the rural economy, the impact of
                    development projects, how our AID projects were doing, or what the chiefs and
                    missionaries had on their minds about local conditions or government policy. We
                    usually came back with first-hand information on the state of rubber at
                    Firestone and other plantations, the rice and cassava crops, Liberia's major
                    iron mining project in the Nimba mountains in the north bordering Guinea, the
                    illicit diamond trade with Sierra Leone or political nuggets nobody in Monrovia
                    knew about - all of which helped make our reporting real.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Much of your work must also have been focused on the more
                        conventional sectors of Liberia's economy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Most of it, in fact, was focused on Liberia's expanding economy, the
                    result of President Tubman's opening of the country to foreign investment. It
                    had produced a boomlet by the 1950's, not only at the Freeport of Monrovia,
                    which attracted all sorts of distributors, but across the spectrum. For
                    instance, investors came who wanted to gobble up as much as a million hectares
                    of Liberia's prime timber lands full of valuable hardwoods, including ebony - a
                    case in which I got into a major scrape by advising that no kickbacks should be
                    paid. (Tubman personally let Ambassador Jones know that he was “vexed”, although
                    the latter to his credit backed me up ). Others wanted to build hotels, roads,
                    infrastructure, all, of course, badly needed; and, most importantly, there was
                    the huge new LAMCO investment, by the Liberian-American Minerals Company, a
                    mega-million Swedish/American consortium, which was preparing to mine the rich
                    Nimba iron ore deposits. This required building a railroad to carry the ore from
                    high on the Guinean border to the port of Buchanan and the modernization and
                    expansion of that port. All of this called for extensive reporting and analysis
                    of implications for the future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember some of your reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Some of it, and for a variety of reasons.</p>
                <p>i. My very first Despatch (sic).</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>Just after I had arrived, Bill Rush asked me to take look at a small rubber
                    plantation, which was doing poorly. I went to visit it, came back with a lot of
                    notes and impressions and wrote an ingoing five page analysis with reflections
                    on the rubber industry in general and this poor specimen in particular - a first
                    effort of of which I was rather proud. It came back the next day with a fat red
                    line across it and the comment: Boil! So I boiled it down a bit. It came back
                    again. We played this game for over a week, by which time my masterpiece had
                    been reduced to one tight page, and finally came back signed! The lesson: Good
                    reports should be concise and to the point if they are meant to be read in
                    Washington!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that was a learning experience for a Harvard
                        man!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ii. Trade complaints and the Salami brothers</p>
                <p>The bread and butter work of a Third Secretary for Commercial Affairs in those
                    days were the trade complaints filed with the Commerce Department by American
                    businesses, in our case almost invariably against Monrovia's many Lebanese
                    traders; usually matters of bills not paid or sales agreements not lived up
                    to.</p>
                <p>Whatever it was, each required a trip to Waterstreet - pulsing with dense crowds
                    of all sorts of tribal people, Bassa, Kpelle, Mende, the seagoing Kru, or tall,
                    aquiline Mandingos from Guinea and beyond, and their usually still topless women
                    effortlessly balancing heavy loads on their heads. This is where most of the
                    Lebanese had their metal-shuttered depots and retail businesses, all smelling
                    pungently of spices, dried fish and mounds of rice and other staples, where you
                    could buy virtually anything, from frozen Danish steaks to nails, screwdrivers
                    or even cars. Among them Salami Brothers were preeminent.</p>
                <p>Whoever it was, our conversations, usually over a lukewarm Coke, were invariably
                    civilized and friendly and involved long obscure explanations why there had been
                    an unfortunate 'misunderstanding', followed by promises that the issue would
                    somehow be resolved. Sometimes it was, sometimes it wasn't, but my visits were
                    always interesting, because the Lebanese grapevine, stretched like a web across
                    the country, was the best-informed by far.</p>
                <p>iii. Doing Liberia's first-ever National Accounts</p>
                <p>JAEGER: Another very different project came much later. It was in the depths of
                    rainy season (Liberia gets about 180 inches in a period of six months), most of
                    our required work had been done, and Bill and I were drinking Brandy Alexanders.
                    I have an idea, he said, let's work up Liberia's first-ever National
                    Accounts!</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>So we got out Samuelson's freshman economics textbook which had some examples of
                    how to calculate national accounts, made up large spreadsheets, listed Liberia's
                    sources of economic value, and started filling in the empty spaces. Current
                    figures for things like rubber and iron ore production, port activity etc., were
                    easy, although future projections would depend heavily on world market
                    conditions. Others, like attaching values to the gathering of fire wood,
                    pounding of cassava roots or reflecting in palaver huts, were harder to
                    quantify. But, we were intrepid, dreamed up best-guess figures where we had no
                    statistics, footnoted the whole thing heavily to emphasize that this was at best
                    a rough approximation, not to be used to predict Liberia's economic future, and
                    sent it off to Washington.</p>
                <p>The first result was a glowing commendation from the Commerce Department for our
                    maiden effort. Then months passed until one day a well-turned out banker from
                    one of New York's most eminent establishments, I think it was Citibank, appeared
                    in Monrovia, called on the Finance Minister, presented him with a laminated,
                    gold-tasseled folder with his Bank's projections of Liberia's brilliant economic
                    future and made clear that his bank would be glad to arrange for some extensive
                    loans. The Minister couldn't resist this unexpected offer, bit off much more
                    than he rationally should have, commodity prices promptly dropped, the new debt
                    went into arrears and Liberia almost went bankrupt!</p>
                <p>We came to understand what had happened only when got one of these folders in the
                    mail. It was essentially a reprint of our seat-of-the-pants national accounts
                    report - without the qualifying footnotes! Lesson learned: Never volunteer
                    anything that can even remotely be misused!</p>
                <p>iv. The Crocodile bar</p>
                <p>Still another, involved my discovery of the 'Crocodile Bar', a dingy,
                    Dickensonian establishment with green slimy door steps near the St. Paul river,
                    which, I somehow discovered, was the late-night drinking hole frequented at the
                    time by most of Tubman's cabinet. Usually it was graced by a languid nude
                    extended over the length of the bar whom everyone pretended to ignore and was
                    run by an American fugitive from the law from Brooklyn, who had somehow washed
                    up in Liberia.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>So, bushy-tailed as I was, I would began to include the 'Crocodile' in my late
                    evening rounds when it was cool. Dressed only in tennis shorts and sneakers, I
                    would first pass through the large native parts of town, where people would sit
                    quietly around fires or kerosene lamps in front of little huts murmuring a
                    reassuring 'evenin boss'. Liberia in those years was still a safe and very
                    peaceful place. I might then stop for a while at “Peanut 1” or “Peanut 2”, the
                    two thumping establishments famous for their 'Ghana dancing” to watch the
                    colorful, heaving crowd and join the fun. Around midnight I might finally make
                    my way through dark alleys to the 'Crocodile', where, after a while I came to be
                    accepted as a regular by the cluster of Ministers who gathered there to relax
                    after a hard day running the country. I learned a great deal of what was
                    happening behind the scenes and was happy to note that my reports at staff
                    meetings almost always proved more correct than the rumors passing for
                    information which were circulating around town.</p>
                <p>The lesson, which was to prove so critical in my later assignments, was that
                    genuine human, not just official, contact is essential to any meaningful
                    exchange.</p>
                <p>v. Sierra Leone and the diamond trade</p>
                <p>One of the rotating chores of the more junior officers in those days was to fly
                    to Freetown in Sierra Leone once a month to provide consular services, since we
                    did not have an Embassy there during British colonial rule. My first visit was
                    memorable on several counts.</p>
                <p>First, one's day under British protection started early, since a uniformed
                    servant would bang on the door of one's billet at six AM to bring “tea”, not the
                    first requirement when one had been taken along by some Brits on a late-night
                    carouse. Freetown was also interesting because its look and feel was similar to
                    Monrovia, but subtly different - more colorful, lively and vital, particularly
                    the markets which were bursting with life - and, at that time, a bit more
                    orderly, as a result of colonial rule. Traffic, for instance, was smartly
                    controlled by British-trained policemen in sharp contrast to Monrovia's
                    chaos.</p>
                <p>The dramatic part of my visit took place that afternoon when, after I had
                    finished my stint at a hotel issuing visas, and visited the dilapidated bar at
                    the City Hotel made famous in Graham Greene's 'Heart of the Matter', I stopped
                    by the British officer's club. I was standing at the bar pensively having a
                    beer, when a Major came up to me, knocked me down with one punch and walked
                    away, saying: “That's for Suez, Yank!” I was picked up, my bleeding nose taken
                    care of, and profuse apologies offered over some fresh drinks. Just a bit later
                    a smart-looking aide to the Governor General arrived hurriedly, proffered the
                    GG's apologies and an invitation to a delightful tea at the residence - where I
                    was driven in the official Rolls and which I much enjoyed, even though my suit
                    was a bit the worse for what it had been through.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Apologies having been accepted I was invited the next day to the Brits
                    intelligence HQ, since I had expressed some interest in the diamond trade.
                    Although it was an interesting visit to a rather high-tech bunker, I didn't
                    learn much, except for a story proudly told, of how the Brits recently dealt
                    with a rather middle-aged Soviet “graduate student”, clearly a KGB officer, who
                    had arrived a few months ago to “work on his thesis on Sierra Leone”. Anxious to
                    avoid a fuss with Moscow which kicking him out would have involved, he was
                    'helped' to leave under his own steam only a few weeks after arrival with, what
                    my interlocutor described with understated satisfaction, a impressively blooming
                    case of syphilis! Ah, perfidious Albion!</p>
                <p>While all this made for good one-time reporting, the continuing theme was the
                    diamond trade which, then as now flowed through Monrovia. It became one of my
                    specialties, the subject of a long series of reports, since I had developed a
                    good range of contacts among the principal traders, was able to obtain
                    reasonable estimates of the amounts involved, and could fairly accurately
                    diagram the flows, including Soviet interest in commercial diamonds. Diamonds
                    were a constant cause of trouble in Sierra Leone, although their illicit export
                    through Liberia was at the time effectively condoned.</p>
                <p>vi. The Liberian population issue</p>
                <p>JAEGER: One of the most basic issues we puzzled over was the uncertainty
                    surrounding the size of Liberia's population. The official figure at the time
                    was around 2 Million, a number Bill Rush and I found difficult to accept since
                    we could not account for half that number in our travels in the interior. Our
                    hunch was confirmed when we obtained a US Air Force aerial photo map of the
                    country made some years earlier as part of an African mapping project. One rainy
                    day we sat down on the floor with that large, detailed map, started counting
                    villages, then made estimates of huts per comparably sized villages, made a
                    generous guess as to how many people to count per hut, and finally added a
                    hyper-generous number for Monrovia.</p>
                <p>No matter how we stretched it, we couldn't even reach a million; a conclusion
                    which, when we first casually mentioned it to some Liberian Ministers at a
                    dinner, produced an explosion of anxiety! They allowed as to how this was the
                    country's only real state secret, and begged us not to report it to Washington
                    and the UN, since all their aid requests were based on the 2 Million number!</p>
                <p>We, of course, felt required to do so, leading to subsequent readjustments.
                    Official statistics now roughly confirm our estimate and set the 1958/9
                    population at a bit over 900,000 (we thought at the time that the real number
                    was closer to 750,000) and acknowledge that earlier figures were inflated. In
                    retrospect our bit of research resulted in an important breakthrough, since its
                    not often that you can cut the population of a country by half in one
                    afternoon!</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>If current statistics can be believed, the population has since quadrupled to
                    over 4 Million, an amazing explosion, in spite of the terrible intervening wars,
                    which, if correct, will have far-reaching implications for the country's
                    future.</p>
                <p>g. Tubman, the Honorables and Liberian politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking a bit to the larger picture, how was President
                        Tubman doing while you were there? Did you get to know him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Tubman's great contributions were that he had given the tribal people the
                    vote, which diluted the power of the 'Honorables', and that he opened Liberia to
                    foreign investment. He was a shrewd, but benevolent autocrat, who skillfully
                    manipulated Liberia's 'democratic' system; didn't kill an awful lot of people,
                    except when they were caught plotting to overthrow him, as was the case a year
                    or so before I got there; and held only a few hundred political prisoners in
                    undoubtedly quite unpleasant upcountry camps. He was also a great friend of the
                    United States, not only because of Liberia's historic relationship with America,
                    but because he really liked Americans and understood the importance of being on
                    good terms with Washington to gain as much aid and support as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Liberia, of course, was traditionally run by the
                        descendants of American slaves, who then settled there...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: There is a lot of irony in Liberia's history, since the freed American
                    slaves, who arrived there through the first half of the 19th century, never
                    integrated with the African natives they encountered. On the contrary, conscious
                    of the skills and knowledge they had gained as American plantation slaves, they
                    promptly set themselves up to rule and exploit the tribal people. In my time you
                    could still see the overgrown remains of their white mini-mansions here and
                    there in the bush, complete with pillars and porticos, which the 'Americans', as
                    the early settlers called themselves, built in emulation of their former
                    masters.</p>
                <p>The irony extends to the national anthem's claim that “The love of Liberty
                    brought us here”. Actually they had little to do with getting there, since the
                    were sent to Africa. Officially the impulse to free them, beginning in the time
                    of President Monroe - hence Monrovia - and extending to about the middle of the
                    19th century, was Christian brotherly love - a sense of compassion for this
                    rather small number of mostly house slaves, which was certainly not extended to
                    the rest.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The real reasons may have been less admirable. Virtually all the freed American
                    slaves who arrived in Liberia were mulattos, who, so the unofficial story goes,
                    were a growing embarrassment to their former American masters and particularly
                    to their wives, because they were so clearly fathered by members of these
                    families. Hence the sudden upsurge of enthusiasm to free them and send them back
                    to Africa, even though, once arrived, only some ten percent survived the rampant
                    malaria and yellow fever to which they were no longer immune. They became the
                    'Honorables', kept their former American masters' names - the Tubmans, Tolberts,
                    Dukeleys, Eastmans, Hortons and so forth - and were still, in the years when I
                    was there, Liberia's ruling class. Having never subsequently been colonized,
                    they, in effect, owned and ran the country like a farm, albeit one with, until
                    very recently, virtually no infrastructure or facilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what, specifically, did Tubman do about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Tubman understood that this was an untenable situation as the twentieth
                    century willy-nilly broke into Liberia's isolation during and after World War
                    II. To preserve Liberia's stability and to keep himself and the Honorables in
                    power, he therefore tried to bring about carefully controlled change: Political
                    participation and slow progress for the tribal people, gradual modernization of
                    the country and an adequate share of goodies for the ruling class to keep them
                    happy and content.</p>
                <p>In practice this meant encouraging foreign businesses to locate in Liberia - in
                    addition to the Firestone Rubber plantation which had already been established
                    in 1923 - through Tubman's 'Open Door Policy'. This was facilitated by the
                    conversion of the Port of Monrovia into a, by my time, rather busy free port,
                    the establishment of some other rubber plantations and the discovery of iron ore
                    in the Nimba range, which eventually resulted in the building of a new rail line
                    to the port of Buchanan by LAMCO, a Scandinavian-American firm, which by the
                    seventies made Liberia the biggest iron exporter in the world.</p>
                <p>As resources, including some American aid, gradually increased, the streets of
                    Monrovia were paved, although deplorably maintained; a basic sanitation system
                    was created; some basic laterite roads were built so that cars and occasional
                    trucks could, weather and ruts permitting, make their way upcountry; some
                    medical facilities came into existence, although most serious care (for
                    Westerners and Firestone's employees) was dispensed by its hospital on the
                    plantation; and literacy and other educational program were gradually
                    advanced.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>As a result of all this, Liberia's average annual growth was impressive in the
                    fifties and sixties, a feat less remarkable than it might seem when one
                    considers that it started from scratch. By the time I arrived, Monrovia, while
                    still a ramshackle potholed place, sported an inefficient Ford garage; there was
                    a certain amount of automotive traffic on its roads; small representations had
                    sprung up for all sorts of modern products, from Italian typewriters to Beck's
                    Beer; and most modern necessities and even some conveniences could be provided
                    by Liberia's Lebanese traders. There were even a small handful of local
                    entrepreneurs, including one Honorable, Stephen Tolbert, who started a tiny
                    fishing fleet. While desperately slow, some economic progress was at least
                    beginning.</p>
                <p>The results of 'Unification', the other pillar of Tubman's policies, were more
                    ambiguous. In a startling effort to bridge the historic divide between the
                    oppressed tribal majority and the ruling Honorables, Tubman had enfranchised
                    native Liberians and women for the 1951 election. While this made him popular
                    upcountry, pleased the international community and gave him leverage against
                    potential Honorable competitors in Monrovia, it did not create real democracy.
                    Tubman's notoriously corrupt True Whig party's electoral machinery, which he
                    controlled, kept him in power and the Honorables on top for twenty eight years
                    by lopsided voting margins reminiscent of Iron Curtain 'elections'.</p>
                <p>Why he thought this was necessary, given his genuine popularity, remains unclear,
                    although I always thought that, in addition to really enjoying his undisputed
                    role, he deeply distrusted the ability of others to keep the country united and
                    moving forward. These fears were realized in spades when, after his successor
                    William Tolbert did allow the creation of an opposition party, the True Whig
                    party fell apart and the country was taken over in 1980 in a bloody putsch, in
                    which Tolbert and then a large number of Honorables were murdered by its first
                    tribal ruler, Master Sergeant Doe. From there it was all down hill.</p>
                <p>h. Tubman's Inauguration</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there for any of Tubman's Inaugurations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, Tubman's Fourth, in 1959, after he had “defeated” William Bright, an
                    'independent' whom they ran to create the appearance that there had been an
                    election. He got all of 55 votes of the 500,000 allegedly cast, after a campaign
                    that had been all show and little substance, punctuated by huge colorful rallies
                    of Tubman's True Whig Party, some of which I attended. Besides endless speeches
                    idealizing Tubman, there were delegations in full tribal attire from all over
                    the country waving streamers and slogans, all sorts of native dancers, noisy
                    bands, etc. It was great fun but not serious politics. By then Tubman had been
                    President since 1943, was hugely popular in spite of some criticism of his
                    autocratic rule, and was to continue in office until his death twelve years
                    later.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>The Inauguration itself took place on an exceptionally hot and rainy day, on
                    which we trudged through the muddy unpaved streets in white tie (!) and top hats
                    to attend the two and half hour long inaugural morning service in a stifling
                    church whose windows remained closed throughout. We then returned to the Embassy
                    for lunch and to change into our morning coats (!) for the afternoon garden
                    party at the Executive Mansion, while our houseboys urgently cleaned and pressed
                    our white ties which were again required for the Presidential dinner that
                    evening at 8 PM.</p>
                <p>I remember a large hall with many card tables for four, on each of which stood an
                    unopened bottle of Johnny Walker Red Label and some glasses. Protocol had me
                    seated with the Postmaster General, his stolid wife and another equally
                    uncommunicative Liberian lady of impressive proportions. Then we all waited for
                    Tubman to arrive, when drinks could officially begin.</p>
                <p>The trouble was he didn't. Initial awkward introductions lapsed into surreal
                    silence which lasted for four hours until, a bit after midnight, an ebullient
                    Tubman finally showed up, having clearly started his celebrations elsewhere,
                    opened his traditional bottle of Black Label and offered his lengthy toast. The
                    rest of the night was a long, weary blur, first an interminable dinner, then
                    more toasts and then the muddy slog back to our houses.</p>
                <p>As the paper said the next morning, a “wonderful time was had by all!”</p>
                <p>i. The Embassy's role: 'Young Turks', AID and unintended consequences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Besides political and economic reporting, what did the
                        American Embassy try to achieve while you were in Liberia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>i. 'Young Turks'</p>
                <p>JAEGER: When I arrived, Bob Allen, our bright and able Political Officer, had
                    launched his 'Young Turks' scheme, of identifying the most promising young
                    people and sending them to American schools under the Fulbright and other
                    programs. The hope was that, after their return, they would replace the
                    massively ineffective and often corrupt older generation of 'Honorables' in
                    government, at the university, and in other key social and economic roles.</p>
                <p>Although Bob caught cerebral malaria - I had to tie him down on his bed with rope
                    while he was lucidly arguing with God until Monrovia's ex-Nazi German doctor
                    could be found to administer some sedatives - his concept was implemented and
                    carried forward. It worked to an extent, until Sergeant Doe shot most of this
                    'Young Turk' generation of 'Honorables' on Monrovia's beach.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>That life with the 'Young Turks” was not going to be all clear sailing either was
                    brought home to me by my friend Earnest Eastman, then a young Assistant
                    Secretary in Liberia's tiny Foreign Office and a prime example of what the next
                    Western-educated generation might look like, who had studied at Columbia and
                    married an African-American girl in the States. Although he had had the full
                    American experience, he returned in a rage about American racial discrimination
                    and hypocrisy; engaged me in sometimes bitter debates which eventually corroded
                    our relationship; tried to treat his American wife like a native, which
                    destroyed the marriage; and consistently debunked Liberia's relationship with
                    the US.</p>
                <p>I got a practical lesson in what Eastman was talking about, when I tried to take
                    a high-level, sophisticated Liberian visitor out to dinner in Washington late in
                    1960. We were asked to leave three well-known restaurants and finally had our
                    meal in a 'black' restaurant on Georgia Avenue!</p>
                <p>ii. Aid</p>
                <p>The main action agency, however, was our 53 person AID mission, which through its
                    development programs reached into every part of Liberian society. The commitment
                    of all involved bordered on the heroic and I developed enormous respect for many
                    of their advisors, experts, midwives etc. who were often living under very
                    difficult conditions deep in the interior, alone or with their families.
                    Unfortunately, as I came to understand it, the AID program, and parallel US
                    military efforts, had intrinsic flaws which in the end contributed to disastrous
                    unintended consequences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Let's start with AID. Not too long after I had settled in, the AID
                    Director sent us his program plan for review, the night before the Ambassador
                    was to approve it. Bill Rush and I pawed through the two-inch thick document
                    which outlined fifty or so conceptually unrelated projects, which ranged from
                    gauging the flow of the St. Paul River to an experimental rice farm upcountry,
                    via forestry projects, educational programs etc. When we argued at staff meeting
                    the next day that the plan lacked coherence, the explanation was that the spread
                    of projects reflected the range of expertise on the staff, and that eliminating
                    one or more would require the expert involved and his family to be transferred
                    or sent home!</p>
                <p>For better or worse the tail was wagging the dog.</p>
                <p>More serious were the issues created by AID's major project, of giving Liberia a
                    system of farm-to-market roads, a new grid which would reach horizontally across
                    the country and meet on a much improved north-south trunk road, from Monrovia to
                    Gbarnga and beyond. To anchor the project, a new K 1-12 school system was to be
                    built at each end so that people from all over could get an education.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>On the face of it the project made sense, particularly for people, like many in
                    the AID Mission, who had first-hand experience with the benefits of
                    farm-to-market roads. The trouble was that this was not the American farm belt,
                    but Liberia. Native villagers are not commercial farmers. Moreover, as the road
                    crews arrived, and were followed by beer and many other trucks, the stone age
                    tribal system simply cracked, since the villagers could see that these new
                    forces were clearly stronger than their chiefs and witch-doctors who were the
                    traditional glue which held tribes and villages together.</p>
                <p>The practical result was that, within weeks, Monrovia was flooded with hundreds
                    of young girls offering their services, refugees from the polygamous tribal life
                    where a wife could be bought for a sack of rice; and where most of them had been
                    the unhappy property of the villages' old men, the only ones who could afford
                    them. Going downtown became a matter of wading through streams of opportuning
                    girls, crying “10 cents, boss. I can do it better than my sister!”</p>
                <p>In retrospect, what had happened was that, by penetrating the country with roads,
                    with the Nimba railroad to move LAMCO's iron ore to the new port at Buchanan and
                    with a growing number of other well-intentioned Western projects, the Tubman
                    administration and we had, with best intentions, punctured and discredited the
                    stone age culture which had held Liberia's tribal society together; a basic
                    transformation which set the stage for the later bloody uprising of tribal
                    people, who were increasingly adrift between their long-held traditions and
                    beliefs and the new world taking charge around them.</p>
                <p>iii. Come the military</p>
                <p>The detonator for that disaster was also supplied during my two-year tour, when
                    it was felt in Washington, that an American Cold War ally like Liberia needed
                    something better than Tubman's rag-tag ceremonial guard evident at public
                    events. As a result, a capable and very nice African-American Lieutenant Colonel
                    turned up, took over a large coastal tract west of town, built a simple military
                    camp which came to be known as the Barclay Training Camp, and attracted
                    recruits. These eventually numbered over 5000 drawn primarily from young tribal
                    men.</p>
                <p>I watched them train in visits which involved wading across crocodile-infested
                    streams behind a protective phalanx of dispensable recruits. The program was
                    clearly a success, if only one didn't dwell on the underlying issue that we
                    were, for the first time in Liberia's modern history and with Tubman's evident
                    consent, arming the tribes with fairly modern infantry weapons. The incorrect
                    assumption was that they would maintain discipline and loyally serve the
                    'state'. What happened, in practice, was that, once the True Whig Party's
                    control was compromised some years later, they wiped out the Honorables under
                    the leadership of Sergeant Doe, shooting them by the dozens on the beach, a
                    revolution which in turn precipitated the subsequent total meltdown of
                    Liberia.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>A subset of this was the decision to give Tubman two Navy motor torpedo boats, to
                    “safeguard” his coast. They arrived, were ceremonially turned over, and, under
                    newly trained local command, sped off, one to crash and sink within hours on
                    some rocks, the other to disappear while its Commander paid an extended visit to
                    his tribe on a river down the coast.</p>
                <p>iv. The importance of unintended consequences</p>
                <p>I have often reflected on these well-intentioned mistakes as I watched us make
                    new and even bigger ones, particularly our disastrous current forays in the
                    Middle East. The point is, of course, that before messing with the structure of
                    a society it is crucial to really understand it in depth, and to reflect on the
                    impact actions are likely to have on its stability, if one is to avoid
                    unexpected, often deadly boomerangs. Translated to a broader scale this is also
                    Sam Huntington's warning in his pathbreaking work on the “Clash of
                    Civilizations”.</p>
                <p>Hank Cohen, an experienced Africanist who later became Assistant Secretary for
                    the region, has argued for the same reasons that, to be safe, development must
                    be a much slower process of adaptation, requiring at least a generation just to
                    adjust to the hand-operated wells and wooden plows with which one might
                    cautiously start things of. The trouble is, of course, that its now too late,
                    since our disparate cultures have already come into full contact and have
                    clashed. The ongoing turmoil in much of Africa is the result.</p>
                <p>v. Dr. George Harley</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any people who really understood all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Certainly the late Dr. George Harley. He stood out as the one person I
                    came to know who had a deep and clear understanding of the country and the
                    effect of the then current policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us about him:</hi>
                </p>
                <p>(a). Life and work</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Harley had come to Liberia as a Methodist missionary and medical doctor
                    in 1926, only two years after the more famous medical missionary, Albert
                    Schweitzer, had returned to his mission at Lambarene in the Congo. It took
                    Harley and his wife Winifred over two weeks to cover the two hundred-some miles
                    from Monrovia to Gbarnga and then beyond to Ganta in the Mano country near the
                    present Guinean border, which was the site of his mission selected by former
                    President King. Native bearers carried all their belongings in chests and
                    bundles - household goods, tools, books, medicines, as well as an American car,
                    which Harley had disassembled on the assumption that someday a road would be
                    built on which he could actually drive it.</p>
                <p>Working with the local tribal chiefs, the Harleys then built a big livable stone
                    house, a chapel and the region's first hospital in a mission compound and began
                    catering as much to the bodies as the souls of their native neighbors. Their
                    simple hospital was soon overflowing, as Harley became the first-ever Westerner
                    to establish a trusting relationship with the natives and their chiefs, even
                    though he and Winifred were at that point the only white people in this part of
                    the interior of Liberia. Although Harley could be irritable and demanding,
                    particularly when I came to know him in his later years, when decades of living
                    in the tropical bush had taken their toll, the tribal people came to understand
                    that his only purpose was to do good and learned to appreciate and respect
                    him.</p>
                <p>As a result, as he told me during one of my several visits to the Ganta Mission,
                    he was increasingly accepted by the chiefs and paramount chiefs and so, being
                    among other things an anthropologist, was able to learn a great deal about
                    tribal customs and religion. He was, he once told me, the only Westerner ever to
                    be initiated into the highest level of their secret society, which gave him an
                    unparalleled insight into the forms and meaning of tribal religious practices,
                    but got him in trouble with his Methodist superiors in America, who accused him
                    of going native.</p>
                <p>(b). Accomplishments</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did he accomplish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The results were remarkable. The Ganta Mission eventually expanded to 26
                    buildings built entirely with native labor, including a dispensary, school
                    house, teachers' dwellings, a saw mill, a blacksmith shop, three dormitories, a
                    guest house, and a leper colony. All the necessary craftsmen, carpenters,
                    mechanics, masons, medical technicians etc. were trained by Harley on the
                    spot.</p>
                <p>Moreover, Harley's medical work was entirely self-supporting through a sort of
                    native health insurance scheme involving over 50,000 people. Of all the missions
                    I visited in Liberia, this was by far the most impressive, and could usefully
                    have served as a non-disruptive model for our own aid and development work.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>As it was, Harley sometimes complained bitterly that the Embassy people, although
                    well-intentioned, were doing more harm than good, and wished they would listen
                    to people like himself who understood the country. Perhaps because I was willing
                    to listen, he and Winifred welcomed me on a number of visits and offered kind
                    hospitality.</p>
                <p>(c). Peabody Museum collection and writings</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he make any record of his findings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. For one he collected and then, in 1937, gave to Harvard's Peabody
                    Museum over 350 magnificent masks and artifacts, which still constitute a
                    central part of its African collection. He was also a major figure in Liberian
                    anthropology as an Associate at the Peabody Museum and published two monographs
                    in 1941: 'Notes on the Poro in Liberia' and 'Native African Medecine with
                    special reference to its practices in the Mano tribe of Liberia'. He also made
                    major contributions to the massive, now unavailable, report of the Peabody
                    Museum's Expedition to Liberia, entitled 'Tribes of the Liberian Hinterland',
                    published in 1947 - of which he generously gave me copy which I still have.
                    Finally he wrote his fascinating 'Masks as Agents of Social Control in Northeast
                    Liberia', in 1971.</p>
                <p>After his retirement in the States, his wife Winifred summed it all up in 'A
                    Third of a Century with George Way Harley' in Liberia', a book of which I only
                    recently became aware and have not yet read.</p>
                <p>(d). The heart of the matter: Masks</p>
                <p>In our several conversations, Dr. Harley told stories about his experiences, took
                    me on tours of the mission, showed me his collection of masks and talked about
                    their meaning. The central theme, which I found startling and important, was
                    that the African mask in its pure form is analogous to Christian communion, the
                    swinging gate between time and eternity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Harley argued that the power of the mask was not just the juju and
                    witchcraft of its bowdlerized versions. In its pure form, it was the door
                    through which the deceased speak to their living relatives and vice versa. It is
                    for these reasons that tribal rules regarding masks have, generally speaking,
                    been so strict, although specific practices vary widely and are often distorted
                    by local influences and traditions.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>From then on, when I watched masked witch doctors dancing in a village, it was no
                    longer just a native cultural 'show' as most Westerners perceived it. The witch
                    doctors or their female counterparts, covered in long skirts of straw, their
                    awe-inspiring ancient masks accentuated by striking headdresses, darting here
                    and there, shuffling rhythmically or balancing on stilts, were really part of
                    our universal human experience of trying to reach from time to eternity: The
                    theme discussed so eloquently by Joseph Campbell in his “Masks of God”- in which
                    he established that all humanity, terrified by the abyss, is led by its heroes
                    to the other side. The mask, in Liberia as elsewhere, as Campbell too points
                    out, is the intercom between the sides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you bring back any Liberian masks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Dr. Harley generously gave me two Mano masks which I still have in my
                    study. I was also able to buy a rare “small” mask, a 2 inch portable replica of
                    a normal mask, as well as an exquisite, old Mano chief's chair, its four stubby
                    legs only a couple of inches high - the idea being that everyone else sits on
                    the ground except the chief - which our Vermont visitors invariably think is
                    some sort of English children's chair.</p>
                <p>I also acquired another totem on a trip Bill and I made to the northern Ge or Gio
                    region. Its a human size grey clay head, studded on its cheeks and forehead with
                    large protruding leopard's teeth, eyes marked by cowry shells, the whole topped
                    with feathers. I found it in a village which had never encountered white people
                    before, a half days march through the bush from where the road ended at that
                    time. It was one of at least twenty such heads kept on shelves in their
                    sanctuary, a low palm frond-covered hut. This type of totem or three-dimensional
                    mask is quite rare, and was at the time unknown in Monrovia. There is a
                    reference to it, and an oversimplified illustration, on p. 316 of the Peabody
                    Expedition's Report. Mine, which I had acquired for $5 in a very open
                    negotiation with the heads' keeper, was for some years on display at the African
                    Museum in Washington, D.C. and is now at my home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's all fascinating. Was English understood widely
                        enough in the tribal society that one could use it as the lingua
                        franca?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Versions of pidgin English were spoken by at least some people in the
                    parts of the country touched by roads. Harley, having spent a long time in
                    Liberia, had, of course, learned Mano and a number of other native
                    languages.</p>
                <p>(e). Harley's legacy</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is he still appreciated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>JAEGER: I think he was then and is now a neglected prophet, even though he was
                    legendary in Liberia when I was there. He and Tubman had a very respectful,
                    mutual relationship, even though Harley disagreed with many of his policies.
                    When I knew him towards the end of his time there, he was already suffering from
                    high blood pressure, didn't suffer fools gladly, but was kind if you showed
                    interest in what Liberia was all about.</p>
                <p>There is a key question his work has left unresolved: Whether even his very slow
                    and careful intrusion into stone age Liberian culture could in the longer run
                    have avoided the consequences which our less subtle development efforts have
                    produced; indeed, whether any approach could have forestalled the massive impact
                    of Western culture on Africa and prevented the subsequent meltdowns in Liberia
                    and elsewhere on the continent.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I am afraid, the answer is no.</p>
                <p>Be that as it may, I was greatly privileged to have been among those who could
                    call Dr. Harley one of their mentors and owe him much.</p>
                <p>j. Memorable occasions: The Ambassador's speech, finding a use for City Hall, and
                    our Xmas vacation in Guinea,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you gained some important insights. Were there other
                        events you particularly remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>i. The Ambassador's speech</p>
                <p>JAEGER: Two come to mind. The first was a lesson in integrity. It all started
                    with our growing sense that the Liberian government was not making optimal use
                    of the $3 Million of aid we were making available. When it fell to me to draft
                    Ambassador Richard Lee Jones's speech on the occasion of the dedication of a new
                    AID building, which Tubman was to attend, I put in a polite but clear paragraph
                    expressing our expectation that there would be improvements in the future. The
                    text was cleared up the line, including by the Ambassador, who then read it at
                    the noontime dedication ceremony. When he came to my exhortatory paragraph and
                    raised his voice a notch or two, something quite unexpected happened. Tubman
                    rose, interrupted him to say hoarsely that he hadn't come to be lectured by
                    anyone, and without another word walked out, followed by his entire Liberian
                    entourage!</p>
                <p>After a stunned silence - most of the Ambassadorial corps and many other
                    dignitaries were there besides the AID and Embassy staffs, Ambassador Jones too
                    got up slowly and left, as the rest of us followed. No one spoke to me as I too
                    went back to my office and closed the door. The general feeling was that I had I
                    had written the speech, and that it was therefore all my fault.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>At four in the afternoon the phone rang to announce an Embassy-wide staff
                    meeting. When we were all assembled, the Ambassador opened by saying, that it
                    had been a pretty rough day, but that he wanted everyone to understand that
                    “George here wrote a very good speech, a speech which I fully approved and would
                    give again. If there is any fault, it is my own in not preparing Tubman that
                    there might be some words of criticism...”.</p>
                <p>I will never forget my sense of relief and appreciation for this unexpected act
                    of remarkable integrity. The buck, Jones was saying, stops here!</p>
                <p>ii. The City Hall</p>
                <p>The second, was funny and also had a happy ending. We had, among other things,
                    financed a beautiful new Monrovia City Hall, an elegant white two story
                    structure with lots of offices, halls and facilities. When it came time to use
                    it, it turned out that Monrovia's small mayoral staff could not possibly fill
                    all the new space, hence a certain embarrassment as to what to do with this
                    white elephant. At about that time the Commerce Department sent a Trade Mission
                    to West Africa, for which I was to be responsible in Liberia, which would
                    require extensive exhibition space.</p>
                <p>The fit was perfect. I “rented” the still empty, brand-new City Hall, a move
                    which the local paper happily cited as proof of the building's usefulness, the
                    exhibits fitted elegantly in the brand new space, and all was in place for
                    opening night when President Tubman was in theory scheduled to cut the ribbons
                    at 6 PM. Since senior Liberian officials were almost never on time he was
                    actually expected to turn up later.</p>
                <p>So it was with some horror that, just after six, I heard the sirens of Tubman's
                    car heading in our direction, before neither the Ambassador nor the Embassy's
                    senior staff had arrived and I, still a mere Third Secretary, was the only
                    official presence on the floor. Well, there was nothing for it, I screwed up my
                    courage and went out to greet the President and then started to show him the
                    exhibit, while one of the crew was frantically phoning the Embassy to mobilize
                    the Ambassador.</p>
                <p>A good ten minutes later, Ambassador Jones turned up breathlessly, mumbled
                    apologies and clearly meant to take over. Tubman let him off the hook just a bit
                    by saying that he had had thought the invitation meant “6 o'clock white people's
                    time”, that is, to be on time, but then waved him off. “This young man George is
                    doing a great job showing me around. Let's just continue!”</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>So the President and I spent a good half hour together, he deliberately taking
                    his time, while the Ambassador and a slew of others were made to follow. Even
                    so, Ambassador Jones was again gracious and later thanked me for saving the day.
                    From then on President Tubman always recognized me warmly at various functions,
                    a contact which proved important some years later in Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>iii. Christmas in Guinea</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you take trips to other neighboring African countries,
                        besides your visit to Sierra Leone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The most memorable, was our pretty hair-brained Christmas 'vacation' in
                    Guinea in December 1958. Contrary to all good sense, we set off toward Liberia's
                    northern border in Bill Rush's aging Chevy. By the time we had reached the high
                    tropical forests in the Nimba range on Christmas eve, we had had all of fourteen
                    punctures. The last, was terminal. There was nothing for it but to abandon
                    ship.</p>
                <p>So we sat down next to our wreck wondering whether we would come out of this
                    alive and waited. After what seemed like hours listening to the strange night
                    sounds of the high forest, we finally saw a beam of light from, what turned out
                    to be, a small, merrily painted mammy-wagon, which heaved into sight and rescued
                    us. We climbed gratefully into the back where we found an odd assortment of
                    fellow travelers seated under the canvas canopy on two benches, one on each
                    side, all bound for Nzerekore, the first small town on the Guinean side of the
                    border. I remember a Catholic priest, a Lebanese trader, a couple of native
                    Liberians, and, up front, the driver and a woman, with whom he was passionately
                    intertwined while swigging from a bottle of beer and driving.</p>
                <p>Then disaster struck again. A huge tree, at least five feet in diameter, had
                    fallen across the already 'so-so' road, blocking our way. Some futile efforts
                    were made to go around it. In the end we all went back to our places in the
                    Mammy wagon, exhausted and dripping with perspiration, resigned to spending this
                    strangest of all Christmas nights in the high Nimba. Someone produced some beer,
                    some Christmas carols were tried and abandoned, and a prayer was said by the
                    priest. For Bill, it was all one disaster too much. He stretched out on the
                    floor between everyone's feet, declared this was the end and mentally took his
                    leave as a new wave of driving rain drummed on our canvas roof.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>Maybe it was the prayer, or voodoo or the grace which comes with Christmas, but
                    another hour or so later there was a sudden movement in the woods and a group of
                    small, virtually naked natives, who evidently live in the Nimba forests,
                    appeared mysteriously - how they knew we were there was never explained - and
                    went to work cutting the tree apart with primitive saws and axes to make an
                    opening just sufficient to let our wagon through. In the process, a wet and
                    messy job, what with rain, mossy ground cover and tangled limbs, one of them cut
                    off most of his big toe, which I tentatively stuck back where it belonged and
                    taped, while the priest blessed the proceedings. By dawn we were finally off the
                    mountain and across the border, and, weary, hungry, dirty and wet, left our
                    fellow travelers at a Caravanserai near Nzerekore, where we decided to rest and
                    spend Christmas day.</p>
                <p>The place, it turned out was run by another fugitive from the law, an outgoing,
                    very hospitable Viennese murderer, who for reasons he did not elaborate had done
                    away with one of his close female relatives - if I remember correctly an
                    especially annoying aunt. He now found himself the proprietor of this single
                    story caravanserai on the edge of nowhere, its sandy garden baking in the
                    unforgiving sun, its stony periphery absurdly decorated with forlorn-looking
                    Christmas lights.</p>
                <p>He made us warmly welcome, gave us each an adequate room and let us sleep; in my
                    case only after I had evicted a huge lizard which almost frightened me to death,
                    since getting in bed with what, at first I thought was a large snake, is
                    obviously not very funny. When we had marginally recovered, the Christmas
                    celebrations proper got under way with a surprisingly good dinner, I think I
                    remember Wiener Schnitzel 'a l'Africain', and a great deal of champagne and
                    other wash-me-downs. I have the impression there were six or eight of us, a
                    characteristically motley but congenial crew which had somehow washed up that
                    broiling Christmas day on the frontier of Guinea and Liberia.</p>
                <p>The next day, lo and behold, a spanking new red Ford pick-up truck turned up in
                    the mid-day heat on its way to Kankan, Guinea's third-largest town some 250
                    miles north across flat and increasingly dry savannah, which had been the object
                    of our expedition. We negotiated a ride and found ourselves fairly comfortably
                    ensconced in the open back, where the breeze ameliorated the late afternoon
                    heat. All went well until sunset when we learned that savannah can get as cold
                    at night as it is hot during the day. Dressed only in tropical weight shirts and
                    shorts, we froze even under the tarpaulin we had found, and were much relieved
                    when we finally pulled into Kankan in the early hours of the morning and our
                    driver dropped us at a small hotel.</p>
                <p>The scene there could not have been more astonishing. For the place was jumping
                    with Frenchmen loudly celebrating their last night in Guinea, determined not to
                    leave behind one bottle of French champagne or tin of pate de foie gras! They
                    asked us to join them, which we did with enthusiasm after our stark adventures,
                    and ate, drank, listening to their song and laughter, until well after 3 AM!</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>We had, we shortly came to realize, run into the last phases of the French exodus
                    from what had been a French colony since 1890; an exodus precipitated by
                    Guinea's rejection of De Gaulle's proposed constitution for the Fifth Republic
                    in a referendum which had been held on October 2. As a result, Guinea had become
                    the first French African colony to gain independence under its new leader, a
                    former labor agitator, now socialist-leaning autocrat Sekou Toure.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, the new regime found us faster than we could have wished. At 7
                    AM, after only a few hours sleep which had not yet made much of dent in our
                    hangovers, there was a loud banging on our doors, armed Guinean soldiers
                    entered, ordered us out of our beds and marched Bill and myself at bayonet
                    point, dressed only in our pajamas, to one of Kankan's public squares.</p>
                <p>The scene was memorable. A little table had been set up, covered with cloth,
                    behind which sat our three “judges”; a fairly large colorful crowd had already
                    gathered; and we were told to stand to hear the charges that were then
                    sonorously read out in French: That we were American spies and subversives who
                    had seditiously consorted with French agents and provocateurs. What did we have
                    to say?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know any French at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I had only a smattering, but Bill spoke passable French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well that was quite a situation!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It certainly was. Standing there in this square in front of these
                    obviously hostile 'judges' cheered on by the native chorus behind us, it was
                    clear we were in a rather serious fix.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Bill Rush then put on one of the greatest impromptu performances I have
                    ever witnessed in the Foreign Service. He drew himself up, mustering as much
                    dignity as he could dressed in his rumpled baby-blue pajamas, looked sternly at
                    our 'judges' and told them that we come from a country which had a greater witch
                    doctor with more 'medicine' than anybody in Guinea, or in fact in all of Africa!
                    He told them that our 'medicine' was called the atom bomb, and that our great
                    chief did not like it when tribes in foreign countries harassed and threatened
                    members of his tribe. In short, Bill announced, with a stern, straight face, if
                    they so much as touched a hair on our heads and didn't release us promptly, an
                    atom bomb would come down on Kankan, and they would all be dead!</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>There was a great murmuring in the crowd and all the turbans began wagging. The
                    judges nervously consulted with each other, while we stood there as nonchalantly
                    as we could, trying to look unconcerned. The lead 'judge' eventually announced
                    that there were mitigating circumstances, and that some lesser sentence would be
                    applied to us, like telling us to get out town - which is what we did after a
                    much-needed, excellent breakfast at our hotel.</p>
                <p>We then got on the next plane and flew to Conakry, where, to our amazement, we
                    were again arrested!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The capital of Guinea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, where we were again arrested at the airport! There was, we were told
                    by a not very experienced interrogator, a record, of Bill's earlier visit to
                    Cote d'Ivoire during which he had asked 'suspicious questions' about the
                    country's mineral production! The policeman interviewing us presumed therefore
                    that we were both spies, in spite of our loud protestations that we were just
                    American diplomats on a fraught Christmas vacation!</p>
                <p>The only possible explanation for this latest crisis was that the French had left
                    behind their files on the activities of foreign diplomats in their African
                    colonies. We confirmed this when the officer went to the bathroom and left
                    Bill's 'file' on his desk! It took a couple more hours of palaver until we were
                    released, with admonitions never to return, and flew back to the safety and
                    comforts of Monrovia!</p>
                <p>In retrospect what we had witnessed were the first, turbulent and awkward pangs
                    of African independence, a historic earthquake which had begun in Guinea earlier
                    that year and became a continent-wide flood in the 1960s, when colonialism
                    finally met its end almost everywhere across the African continent.</p>
                <p>k. New colleagues</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened in the second part of your tour? Were there
                        new people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Ambassador Jones was replaced late in 1959 by Elbert Mathews, a
                    distinguished Foreign Service Officer who struck me, both in looks and demeanor,
                    as a model senior diplomat, whom I came to admire greatly. He and his wife
                    Naomi, introduced a new spirit of professionalism in the Embassy which improved
                    morale as well as our relations with President Tubman, who had grown a bit weary
                    of Ambassador Jones' not too effectual bonhomie. Tubman probably welcomed this
                    shift to a professional Ambassador as a sign that the US was taking Liberia more
                    seriously and clearly liked Mathews' polite briskness.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>To be fair, the groundwork for the US-Liberian Mutual Defense Agreement of 1959
                    was laid during Ambassador Jones' time, when Tubman decided to resist earlier
                    temptations to play the Cold War down the middle - after the US had obliged him
                    to cancel a planned Moscow visit in 1956. However, the relationship blossomed in
                    the Mathews era, which, for better or worse, led to the erection of a huge VOA
                    transmitter on the outskirts of Monrovia, and a series of new communications and
                    defense arrangements, which made Liberia a full-dress partner in the final
                    stages of the Cold War. To get a sense of the size and scope of this
                    transformation, Liberia received over $500 Million in aid by the end of the
                    Reagan era, in spite of Sgt. Doe's flagrant human rights abuses, as compared to
                    the $3 Million we provided when I was there.</p>
                <p>Whether, as I suggested earlier, all this was good for Liberia or contributed to
                    its implosion, is a question which, as far as I know, neither Tubman nor the
                    Embassy's leadership considered at the time.</p>
                <p>There were other changes. Philip Narten, a competent but driven and slightly
                    brash FSO succeeded Bill Rush as head of our two-man Economic Section. We
                    generally worked well together, although Phil, often preoccupied with his
                    sometimes temperamental wife Theresa and their children, spent comparatively
                    little time upcountry, and on occasion worried us when he went for long swims,
                    sometimes at night, in Liberia's notoriously dangerous surf. For all that, we
                    got along well, and met again, many years later, in Paris, where he was then
                    living by himself after leaving the Foreign Service, doing demanding, perhaps
                    deliberately punishing, bicycle tours all over France.</p>
                <p>There was also Allan Davis, who succeeded Bob Allen as Political Officer, a
                    socially adapt, clever, civilized young officer from Tennessee, whose
                    finely-tuned sometimes sardonic sense of humor was matched by his extraordinary
                    gift for understanding and remembering the complex human web which made up
                    Liberian higher society. He was, among other things, a brilliant dancer, usually
                    seen with the tall, elegant daughter of the distinguished Haitian Ambassador. We
                    briefly housed together but met only once in later years, when Allan was
                    Political Advisor to the Army Command in Stuttgart. He remained an Africanist
                    and eventually served as Ambassador in Guinea and Uganda.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Lastly, I should mention Milner Dunn, Paul Guest's genial successor as DCM - a
                    lanky, humorous, consistently friendly man who chafed at spending long hours in
                    our unairconditioned offices. Finding ourselves to be kindred spirits, we soon
                    joined forces in building a get-away beach house some twenty miles east of town;
                    a project fascinating in itself, since it required many trips on back roads to
                    talk the local villagers into leasing us some beach front and then building us a
                    small, but splendid bamboo house - open on all sides but offering protection
                    from the scorching sun. Apart from a girl's bush school across a lagoon, there
                    was nothing to be seen except the endless reach of the Atlantic and the wide,
                    curving, empty beach with its fringe of palm trees, which extended for many
                    miles in both directions with not a soul in sight. It was a wonderful place to
                    read and meditate, a tranquility only sometimes disturbed by giggly visits from
                    the bush school. When I finally had to leave this African paradise, the village
                    chief, who had become a friend, asked if I would take his son to America to have
                    him educated. Given the uncertainties of Foreign Service life, I was seriously
                    tempted, but had to turn him down.</p>
                <p>l. Dinners, David and Congressional visits</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, those were telling adventures. Can you describe a
                        bit what the rest of Embassy life was like in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: We worked and some of us lived in the same compound on Mamba point, with
                    its spectacular views of the south Atlantic, which the Embassy occupies to this
                    day - although, judging from Google aerial views, a number of buildings, tennis
                    courts and pools have been added.</p>
                <p>I first shared a house there with Bob Allen, the Political Officer, but, after
                    his departure, was assigned the ground floor apartment in a rather primitive
                    local duplex a bit up the road, where Bill Rush had the upstairs unit; an
                    arrangement which, led to some memorable joint culinary ventures during the long
                    rainy season.</p>
                <p>i. Duck a l'orange</p>
                <p>The most notable was our decision, on a particularly drenched and hopeless day,
                    to prepare a 'duck a l'orange' from scratch. We pooled our two houseboys and
                    their two 'assistants', assigned one team the preparation of the sauce, the
                    other of the ducks fetched from the Embassy freezers, and, reinforced with sips
                    of Brandy Alexanders, read them successive step-by-step instructions from the
                    “Joy of Cooking”, our teams reporting back as each task was completed. The end
                    product was delicious, and became the 'piece de resistance' of a memorable and,
                    if I remember correctly, rather liquid party.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>A bit later I was given a lovely house of my own, with glorious views of the sea
                    and a plethora of tropical trees and plants, which, among others, produced an
                    oversupply of papayas and bananas. My kind and loyal house boy David cooked,
                    cleaned and handed me my gin-and-tonic when, drenched with rain or perspiration
                    I came home from work, and over time learned to make some quite excellent
                    dinners.</p>
                <p>ii. Gin fizz and driver ants</p>
                <p>David had been with me since my arrival, when he had helped me put on my first
                    ever dinner party! The obligatory guests of honor were the Deputy chief of
                    Mission Paul Guest, a perceptive but rather cautious man with gold-rimmed
                    glasses and sharp pencils with which he constantly improved the grammar and
                    syntax of our telegrams and despatches(sic); and his delicate wife who was
                    determined not to get a suntan on the equator, so staid largely indoors, behind
                    valuable Chinese screens, and let it be known through body language and demeanor
                    that her stay in this God-forsaken outpost was an indignity due only to her
                    husband's failure to make a better career.</p>
                <p>Things that evening got off to a bad start when Mrs. Guest asked if I could make
                    a gin-fizz, and, when I brought a reasonable facsimile, having first had to look
                    up the recipe, asked her husband what on earth had happened to the Foreign
                    Service, since “they no longer even know how to make a decent gin-fizz”!</p>
                <p>Things, got worse when, as we sat down to a pretty decent Danish steak, there was
                    loud shriek, followed by a stampede away from the table, which was being
                    traversed by a six inch- wide army of driver ants, having come in through an
                    open window! The crowning disaster was desert, for which David brought little
                    plates, each with ten perfectly squared and polished cubes of hard-frozen
                    strawberries, decorated with a squirt of whipped cream! He later explained how
                    carefully he had sawed the tins of frozen strawberries into these precise cubes
                    and had had the dickens of a time keeping them from melting until it was time to
                    serve! Needless to say, the Guests never came again.</p>
                <p>iii. Playing God</p>
                <p>It was some much more successful dinners and receptions later, when David told me
                    that, since he was the main provider for his extended family and I was his boss,
                    it was now my role to settle some nasty disputes which had arisen in his
                    extended family. Could they all come on a certain day, so that I could hear the
                    cases and render judgement! I had, to my amazement, become their de facto
                    chief!</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>Well, the day came, and I found at least thirty tribal people of all ages and
                    shapes sitting on every available surface in my living room when I came home
                    from work. I sat down in my biggest chair as David had suggested, opened the
                    proceedings, and then listened to a long series of largely incomprehensible
                    charges and countercharges, mostly involving impenetrable issues of marital
                    infidelity, hence questions of who was to pay how much to whom, which David
                    translated as best he could.</p>
                <p>After two long hours of palaver I had no idea who was in the right and asked
                    David what to do. He said, to my renewed surprise, that it really didn't matter
                    as long as the argument was resolved. I should just decide as best I could and,
                    he assured me, they would all be grateful and accept my verdict. I did, ruled in
                    favor of one party and against the other, and, to my further astonishment, saw
                    that that almost everyone was pleased and shuffled out with exclamations of:
                    “Thanks, boss!” David said I did fine and was evidently pleased as well.</p>
                <p>iv. Black 'white' men and Inspectors</p>
                <p>David especially rose to the occasion when he thought it counted, for instance
                    the day our African-American Public Affairs Officer came to dinner, and David
                    asked: “ Boss, is that black white man coming tonight?”, a question which
                    underscored that it was not skin color but culture which made the difference in
                    Liberia!</p>
                <p>He also outdid himself, leading a temporarily enlarged team of assistants, in
                    producing receptions and dinners while our State Department Inspectors were
                    visiting the Embassy. Knowing that Liberian officials and Honorables tended to
                    be casual about invitations, sometimes never showed up, or might drift in an
                    hour late, Bill Rush and I had personally called on virtually all of our
                    contacts beforehand and reminded them that the Economic Section had done many
                    good things for Liberia in general and them in particular, and that this time it
                    was we who needed help. They were to show up at our reception for the Inspectors
                    on time and without fail - and, when the appointed hour came, they actually did!
                    There was a long line of impeccably dressed, sober and serious-looking members
                    of Liberia's elite lined up before our door, much to the astonishment of our
                    old-school tie Inspectors.</p>
                <p>Needless to say the party was a great success, our guests were much pleased with
                    their own performance and some even asked, on the way out, if they had done OK!
                    It was all a lovely tribute and an affirmation that we had made real
                    friends.</p>
                <p>The disillusionment came, when the Chief Inspector, a southern gentleman of
                    distinguished lineage, told me on the last day how well we had done, and added
                    that he really admired how we managed to work under these incredibly primitive
                    conditions with all these negroes!</p>
                <p>The guy was unreconstructed and didn't have a clue!</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>By contrast, David sent me a Christmas card some months after I had left Liberia
                    with the message that he had given $10 to his church (he only made about $20 a
                    month) so that they would pray for me! It closed: “You need it!” Even though
                    David had only a second grade education, suffered from malaria, schistosomiasis
                    and God knows what else, he was a wonderful servant and, more importantly, a
                    loyal, valued friend.</p>
                <p>v. Dressing a Congressman</p>
                <p>There was only one Congressional visit during my tour, since Liberia, in those
                    days, was clearly not on the Washington power circuit, an elderly Congressman
                    who was a member of the Armed Serves Committee. As his 'control officer' I
                    thought it was terrific that I could billet him as one of the very first guests
                    in the brand-new Mamba Point Hotel, an imposing, modern building put up by an
                    Israeli firm, with magnificent views and all the latest conveniences. Having
                    settled him in, I was to pick him up again for the Ambassador's black-tie dinner
                    in his honor.</p>
                <p>So it was a bit of a shock when my phone rang late in the afternoon and there was
                    the Congressman shouting at me in a rage that “all his clothes were gone!”. I
                    found him in his room a few minutes later, stark naked and still raving,
                    demanding that I “do something!”. What had happened, of course, was that the
                    Hotel had had to hire a virtually brand-new, untested staff, mostly young men
                    straight out of the bush. When our Congressman's attendant saw his luggage, he
                    must have thought that this was more wealth than he could acquire in a lifetime,
                    and had simply made off with it and disappeared into the bush. I rang the
                    Embassy's alarm bells and collected enough formal clothing so that the
                    Congressman could in fact show up for the dinner - albeit, only somewhat
                    mollified. He left soon thereafter never to be heard from again.</p>
                <p>m. Last days in Liberia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you then leave Monrovia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: As my tour came to its end I had become so attached to Africa that I
                    wanted to make an African career and had asked to be assigned to the African
                    seminar at the Foreign Service Institute. However, personnel, like God, works in
                    mysterious ways. Their decision arrived in April 1960, when I learned that I had
                    been assigned instead to nine months of intensive Serbo-Croatian language
                    training in Washington, for onward assignment to Yugoslavia. Although I would
                    have preferred Russian and then Moscow, the pill had been sweetened by my second
                    promotion, to FSO-6, earlier that spring. Although I would still be a
                    Vice-Consul, I was now to be a Second Secretary! Almost a real person!</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>By July I was off, after the usual haze of packing, parties and arrangements,
                    first to see my parents in Kansas City and then to take some leave. As the plane
                    lifted off Roberts Field and arced out over the ocean, I looked back on Monrovia
                    and the endless miles of palm-fringed beach which extended west and east to the
                    horizon, and choked up with sadness. I had, to my own intense surprise, come to
                    love this country, for all its terrible problems and its many faults. In a very
                    real way it had become home.</p>
                <p>Part IV: Zagreb, Aviation and European Affairs</p>
                <p>1. Learning Serbo-Croatian at the Foreign Service Institute</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the next chapter in your life was to learn
                        Serbo-Croatian. What was that like in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Language training was held in cramped quarters in Arlington Towers on the
                    other side of the Potomac River. The five or six students in the Serbo-Croatian
                    class and our two instructors met for six hours a day for the next nine months
                    in a small windowless, badly ventilated room, all seated around a rectangular
                    table just big enough to hold us. Among our group were Bill Dyess, a bright
                    sardonic southern conservative, who had just entered the Foreign Service and was
                    to make his mark in the Reagan administration when he became Department
                    spokesman and was then kicked upstairs as Ambassador to the Hague and Goody
                    Cook, a bright and very effective officer who went to the Political Section in
                    Belgrade and eventually became Ambassador to the Central African Republic.</p>
                <p>a. Jankovic and Popovic</p>
                <p>The instructors were the then famous Serbian cousins, Jankovic and Popovic, who
                    came from the same Serbian village near Belgrade, had both been attorneys, had
                    both served as cavalry officers in the Serbian Army, had both survived the war
                    as German POWs, and then came together to the US. Here they lived in the same
                    house with their respective wives, two sisters, and both ended up as FSI
                    instructors. Yet for all that they were as different as two people can be. Janko
                    Jankovic was a poetic soul, a grammarian, a person who cherished Serbian
                    literature, and had deep feelings for Serbian culture. Although less
                    enthusiastic about other parts of Yugoslavia, he was always moderate in his
                    views.</p>
                <p>Dragutin Popovic was quite a different kettle of fish. A round-headed, large,
                    energetic man, he never let anyone in doubt that he had been a Serbian cavalry
                    officer and that this was the formative experience in his life. His oft-repeated
                    story, which he told us at least three times in the course of our months
                    together concerned the day when, as a young lieutenant, he was riding somewhere
                    on his horse, and found a soldier in the process of raping a peasant girl in the
                    bushes. He rode up to him, he would recount with emphasis, and “meted out swift
                    Serbian justice!” Then a dramatic pause, “I cut his head off!”</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>So, Jankovic and Popovic, besides endlessly repeating sentences, which we tried
                    to repeat by rote, were our main introduction to the polarity of Serbian
                    civilization, and of the tensions between Serbians, Croatians and the rest, and
                    supplied pretty much the sum total of our country knowledge; since, apart from a
                    few occasional talks, FSI made no serious effort to supplement our intense
                    language training with the historic, cultural, political or economic background
                    of the country where we were about to serve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Must have felt unreal!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>b.George Kennan comes to visit</p>
                <p>JAEGER: It was. And the sense of unreality was, if anything, reinforced when,
                    about two-thirds into the course, George Kennan, about to go out to Belgrade as
                    Kennedy's new Ambassador, paid us a visit to meet some of his future staff
                    trying to learn this awful language.</p>
                <p>It turned out to be an unforgettable experience. Kennan, utterly relaxed, slung
                    his leg over a chair and, instead of talking about the Yugoslav situation or his
                    plans as the new Ambassador, launched into a fascinating, historic disquisition
                    about Yugoslavia's orthodox monasteries and their roles in Balkan mediaeval
                    history, with advice as to which ones were particularly beautiful and must
                    therefore be visited while we were there. What, I think, he was trying to
                    convey, was that it was through these magnificent monasteries that we might come
                    to some understanding of the essence of this complex region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sounds like Kennan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, yes. I had come to know him slightly when I had dated his daughter
                    Grace for a while, and had had a similar Slavic-mystical experience one evening
                    in Princeton listening to him as he was sitting on the kitchen table in a
                    Russian nightgown playing the balalaika and absently singing deeply moving
                    Russian folk tunes.</p>
                <p>But back to our meeting at FSI. After listening to him for some time with
                    respectful attention, I asked the question which I thought was on everybody's
                    mind: “ Mr. Ambassador, we will certainly try to see the orthodox monasteries.
                    But for now, is there anything you would like us to do before we get to
                    Yugoslavia? Are there any special things you'd like us keep in mind when we get
                    there?”</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>His reply was unforgettable. “Oh, you mean all that policy stuff? Don't worry
                    about it, I'll be the one doing all that.” In case we had missed the point he
                    spelled it out: “You know, you are just being given a wonderful opportunity to
                    absorb Slavic culture, and I would hope you would make the very best use of it
                    and spend your two-year tour sopping it up, the way I did when I was a young
                    officer in Russia.”</p>
                <p>On that note he left us, somewhat bewildered, very charmed, and looking forward
                    to see how this division of labor would actually work in practice. But that's a
                    story for later on.</p>
                <p>c. Learning like children</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I bet reality was somewhat different. But, back for a
                        moment to FSI, tell us how the language training process actually
                        worked.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The emphasis was exclusively on the spoken language, the intention being
                    to get us up to a level where we could communicate and function effectively in
                    Yugoslavia. No effort was made to teach us to write.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the oral method of language teaching?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. Either Jankovic or Popovic - they took turns because it was very
                    tiring - would repeat sentences from FSI's book, which we then repeated. You
                    kept doing that, initially without understanding what the words meant or how the
                    sentences were structured, one chapter a week if you were having a good week and
                    one chapter in two weeks if we were having problems. Repeating and repeating, ad
                    nauseam. The underlying idea was that you learned the way a child learns by
                    simply hearing and repeating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the fact that you were already bilingual in German
                        helped?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Not really. The FSI method was not based on teaching grammar, which came
                    far later in the course. The beginning, in particular, was purely inductive and
                    repetitive, until we began to recognize certain patterns ourselves and learned
                    to understand and use them. Grammatical explanations were filled in
                    retrospectively, and drills of conjugations, declensions etc. came only toward
                    the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How steadily did people progress in practice? Or was it an
                        uneven ride?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>JAEGER: We were told from the outset, that all of us, at one time or another,
                    would hit plateaus - periods when we didn't seem able to make an inch of
                    progress for days and sometimes weeks, and would keep stumbling and having
                    difficulties in spite of working hard. Then, suddenly, there would be a
                    breakthrough. Language training is really a sort of mental programming to which
                    people have psychological reactions, sometimes including periods of depression.
                    I hit a bad patch just before Christmas of that year. Even so, the system worked
                    for most people, as our teachers and the FSI linguist kept assuring us, although
                    they got there at somewhat different rates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have electronic equipment or tapes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. We were told to listen to tapes in our language lab for another hour
                    or two after each day's work with our instructors, again repeating the same
                    stuff. When you got home you were supposed to do still another hour with a tape
                    recorder, although for me that was over the top.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a test at the end of the course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, and we all passed. I then spent a few weeks in the Mid-Career
                    course, a light foreign affairs once-over which did not leave a very deep
                    impression. It was then time to pack up to try out what we had learned in
                    Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>d. Off to Zagreb</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had received your assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, I knew by mid-February that I was going to be a Vice Consul at our
                    Consulate General in Zagreb. Although I had hoped to go to the Political Section
                    in the Embassy in Belgrade, I had never actually done any consular work, either
                    in my first or second assignments, and so understood Personnel's reasoning in
                    making this assignment.</p>
                <p>i. Crossing in style</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went over in the early fall?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>JAEGER: The plan was to arrive in mid-October, after, what in retrospect, was a
                    really delightful Atlantic crossing. I went over on the SS United States, the
                    great liner which had done yeoman service ferrying troops in World War II.
                    What's more, diplomatic officers in those days still traveled first class, even
                    lowly Vice Consuls. So I was assigned a splendid cabin and was on several
                    occasions invited to eat at the Captain's table. The most remarkable fellow
                    traveler among the dignitaries on board was Salvador Dali, whom I discovered one
                    morning on the bow of the ship gazing dramatically out to the horizon, his cape
                    spread wide, fluttering in the breeze. He did not encourage conversation. On
                    arrival in Genoa the local English paper provided still one more ego booster by
                    listing Vice Consul George Jaeger among the 'notable arrivals'! Those really
                    were the days!</p>
                <p>ii. The training worked!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, did the training actually work when you got to
                        Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That, of course, was the key question in my mind when I finally drove my
                    newly acquired Volkswagen from Trieste to the Yugoslav border on my way to
                    Zagreb. Except for Jankovic and Popovic, I had never spoken to a real Yugoslav
                    and had no idea whether the strange noises they had taught us to repeat in
                    Washington would actually work.</p>
                <p>So I remember stopping at the Yugoslav border post with some trepidation. When
                    the tough looking border guard came over, I said with as much firmness as I
                    could muster: “Dobar dan. Kako ste?”, as we had been taught - and was greatly
                    relieved when he clearly understood, smiled a little and gave the textbook
                    answer: “Hvala, druze. Vrlo dobro!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Our language training had actually worked!</p>
                <p>iii. Bleak Zagreb</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, how did you find in Zagreb?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Although that autumn the weather was lovely, Zagreb in 1961 was grimly
                    grey and silent. After the bustle of Genoa and even Trieste, what struck one
                    first was the absence of crowds, the reserve on people's faces, the colorless
                    clothing, the clearly much lower standard of living than in the West. There were
                    cars, but hardly any traffic jams. Streetcars jangled all over town and were
                    still, for most people, the principal form of transportation.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>At night the street lights were weak and left deep shadows. Only Republik Square,
                    at the center of town, was bright, but with the stark, dehumanizing brightness
                    of rooftop neon signs advertising soulless collective enterprises. They etched
                    people and the surrounding, once elegant, 19th century buildings, against the
                    dark in weird ghostly patterns, particularly when the large square was pelted by
                    rain or snow and the glare was reflected in the slush. (Note: At this writing
                    Republik Square has been restored to its earlier, pre-Communist name, Jelacic
                    Square, after a 19th century Croatian leader who defeated the Hungarians and is
                    again a lively, bustling place).</p>
                <p>In short, even a few days in Zagreb left no doubt that this was still a highly
                    controlled Communist police state, with a backward, limping economy, struggling
                    to recoup the enormous wounds inflicted on it and its people by the ravages of
                    World War II - in spite of the fact that Tito's Yugoslavia was far ahead of its
                    satellite neighbors and Croatia and Slovenia were by far the most prosperous
                    parts of a country, where repression here never assumed the proportions that it
                    had in the Soviet empire. Even so, for most people in Zagreb the name of the
                    game was still personal survival, keeping your nose clean and making do. Only
                    those in power and those favored could live well, and some of those lived very
                    well indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any bright spots? What did young people
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Zagreb had restaurants and nightspots, but only the privileged were
                    usually there. We often went to places like the Gradski Podrum, a popular
                    brick-tiled cellar on Republik Square, where a gypsy band played the usual
                    favorites for a scattering of customers - mostly officials, local journalists,
                    people from other Consulates, or the odd tourists passing through. The fare was
                    standard Yugoslav cuisine, things like raznici, cevapcici, the occasional
                    'steak' of dubious origin, goulash or noodle soup, served up with fairly decent
                    Dalmatian wines or thinnish beer, and followed, after some “Strudel” for desert,
                    by one or more rakijas, Croatia's then usually very raw plum brandy.</p>
                <p>Students went to less expensive places for dancing and drinking from what, I
                    later learned, was called, 'internal exile' - you shut out the grey Communist
                    world by building yourself a happier, strictly private reality with your
                    girlfriend in some little rented room.</p>
                <p>To be fair, theater, occasional opera and museums were doing well and keeping
                    cultural life alive with conservatively chosen favorites. The university too
                    remained an important driving force and still had a number of significant
                    Professors, although Communist political correctness remained key to academic
                    survival.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All sounds like a slightly upgraded version of standard
                        Communist reality. Did you see any signs of tension or dissent?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>JAEGER: There were occasional signs, although on the whole Yugoslavia in 1961 was
                    still very disciplined. The newspapers, which we read daily didn't provide much
                    insight, since they only carried carefully censured news and ideologically
                    correct speeches by Communist functionaries extolling the regime. Moreover, even
                    the fairly limited circle of people who showed up at Consulate functions, or
                    whom one met or called on in the course of business, spoke only rarely about
                    what was going on. So it took some time for a neophyte like me to piece things
                    together and, when occasion presented itself, to ask the right questions.</p>
                <p>iv. The Consulate General in Zagreb</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll certainly get back to that later. But for now, can
                        you tell us a bit about how you found the Consulate, and about your
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The Consulate General was housed in a typical 19th century apartment
                    house dating back to the Hapsburg era. On one side it faced Strossmayerov Trg, a
                    section of a long, tree-lined park, with trees and tended gardens. Its entrance
                    was on a side street now called Hebrangova Ulica. After Croatia's declaration of
                    independence the building became the Chancery of the American Embassy. In fact,
                    the office I was to occupy in my second year, with its French windows and
                    balcony, was the Ambassador's office until, after 9/11, the fortress-like new
                    Embassy compound was built in a wheat field outside of town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the old building was not very secure considering you
                        were in a Communist country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Hardly. Since there were no marine guards, the building was opened and
                    closed every day by our devoted Albanian janitor and man-of-all trades Stojan,
                    who also washed the floors and faithfully hung and took down the American flag
                    from its flagstaff on the balcony which overlooked the street, the streetcar
                    tracks and the park.</p>
                <p>It was on that sidewalk, by the way, that thousands of people were to leave a
                    mountain of flowers and lay down a bed of candles when President Kennedy was
                    assassinated on November 22, 1963.</p>
                <p>The rest of the building's layout was equally relaxed. The Consular Section was
                    on the ground floor, so that our local staff and visitors could come and go
                    unimpeded. The Consul General's office, the secure file fault and code room, and
                    all other offices were on the second floor, protected, if I remember correctly,
                    only by 'limited access' signs and locked with ordinary keys at night.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>On the third floor was a bachelor apartment with fading, lumpy furniture and
                    old-fashioned facilities, which for my first year in Zagreb was to be my home. I
                    was lucky to have inherited Invanka Skudas as my maid and cook, a intensely
                    conscientious and good-hearted Slavonian woman who made the place livable, took
                    care of my little establishment, cooked wonderful dinners for me and my guests
                    when I entertained, and came with me when, in my second year, I was assigned a
                    lovely suburban house on 'Tuskanac', a prestigious street on a Zagreb hillside,
                    which even had a swimming pool.</p>
                <p>The apartment became famous after I had left Zagreb when our then American
                    secretary and code clerk became enamored of a Croatian 'riding master' whom she
                    had “happened” to meet on leave in Vienna; moved him in with her in my former
                    third floor apartment where he stayed unnoticed for almost a year (!) and
                    eventually gave him the Consulate's crown jewels. Needless to say he was a
                    senior officer in the UDBA, Yugoslavia's intelligence service.</p>
                <p>v. Joe Godson</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, things certainly have changed. What were the people
                        like at the post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: My first Consul General, when I arrived in the fall of '61, was Edward
                    Montgomery, a genteel, literate, thoughtful career officer, who unfortunately
                    left Zagreb only a few weeks after my arrival.</p>
                <p>He was succeeded by Joe Godson, who was a very different kettle of fish: A Jewish
                    childhood immigrant from Poland, who had studied at CCNY, got a law degree from
                    NYU, and was a product of the American labor movement, Joe was a tough,
                    sardonic, extremely bright, combative and demanding man. He had became a prot�g�
                    of Jay Lovestone, who shoehorned him into the State Department, because of his
                    reliably strong anti-Communism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lovestone was the right-wing communist who broke with
                        Stalin and eventually became the intensely anti-communist director of
                        foreign operations for the AFL-CIO (American Federation of Labor and
                        Congress of Industrial Organizations)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right, and at the time we are discussing, he was the Executive
                    Secretary of the International Federation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), the
                    West's anti-communist labor movement, which had extensive ties to official
                    Washington and greatly influenced the appointment of Labor attach�s. Godson was
                    first made Labor Attach� in Ottawa in 1950, then moved to London for five years,
                    where he reportedly played a major behind-the scenes role in Hugh Gaitskell's
                    battle with the left in the British Labor Party. He was then moved to Belgrade
                    for two years, and then, in 1961, to Zagreb.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Godson like to work for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, it was usually a roller coaster. Joe and his chirpy, pleasant wife
                    Ruth, a former Israeli Foreign Service officer, could be generous and even
                    charming, particularly when everyone was in agreement and he liked what one was
                    doing. More often, however, he was abrupt and demanding. We spent a great deal
                    of energy after his arrival making sure that his residence was up to snuff and
                    the Godson family's many needs promptly taken care of. Moreover, he didn't
                    suffer fools gladly, which was a problem in a small post where none of us
                    escaped his scathing outbursts for some “stupidity”, and where some, like Chips
                    Chester, the gentle scion of a rich Milwaukee family, who looked a bit like a
                    member of the British Royal family, were on his black list almost as soon as
                    they arrived.</p>
                <p>But then there was the positive side. Godson had genuine credentials as the
                    battle-scarred veteran of major political labor wars in the US, Britain and
                    elsewhere. As a result, he had an almost uncanny understanding of what made the
                    Yugoslav leaders tick, and, unlike the rest of us, read the daily Communist
                    press in plain text - that is, he instinctively picked up the nuances which,
                    under the veneer of endless propaganda, told some of the actual tale.</p>
                <p>Perhaps it was because they knew about his past or saw something in him of
                    themselves, Communist heavy-weights like Vladimir Bakaric, the Secretary of the
                    Croatian Communist party, who had been one of Tito's closest associates in World
                    War II and was the undisputed boss of Croatia in our time, respected him,
                    accepted his invitations and tolerated him when, on occasion, he turned his acid
                    scorn on them.</p>
                <p>vi. Godson and Vladimir Bakaric</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you present at any of these exchanges?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, although they took place in my second year in Zagreb, when I had
                    become Godson's deputy and Economic Officer.</p>
                <p>For one, there was the famous evening when Martha Graham's ballet put on a
                    splendid USIA-arranged performance. Godson had invited Bakaric and some of his
                    Croatian Central Committee colleagues to join him in the center loge and had
                    asked me to come along. Afterwards there was a lavish dinner at the residence,
                    with a lot of wine and 'slivo' (plum brandy), which lasted into the wee
                    hours.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>As things got increasingly raucous, and the discussion more and more animated,
                    Godson told Bakaric that it was just outrageous that a country that claimed to
                    be a communist success still couldn't produce enough agricultural products to
                    feed its people and had to import what it lacked at great expense! “Why don't
                    you just break up what remains of the collective farm system and let the farmers
                    farm?”.</p>
                <p>Bakaric gave him a long searching look, then replied like the real partisan he
                    was: “Mr. Consul General” - long pause - “do you think we ran this revolution
                    only to be hung from the lamp posts by our peasants? They will stay where they
                    are.” In other words, Bakaric understood perfectly well, that their still partly
                    collectivized agricultural system was operating far below capacity, that the
                    regime was very unpopular with the farmers, and that the continuing large
                    deficits in wheat production had to be made up by imports. Party control, and
                    its leaders' survival, clearly continued to came first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a curious exchange. I thought collectivization had
                        largely been suspended within two or three years after the break with
                        Moscow. Tito then liberalized agricultural policy, and left the majority of
                        the peasants, as I understand it, independent, but probably hampered by the
                        inability to hire labor, the pricing system, and so forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Actually Tito had abandoned only unprofitable collective farms, while
                    others were retained.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. They were retained both in Croatia and in
                        the Vojvodina where agriculture lent itself to large-scale farming.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: At the same time, there was, as you say, an important private
                    agricultural sector at the time of this exchange , although the great majority
                    of private holdings were still limited to ten hectares and many were obliged to
                    work with “agricultural cooperatives” because they lacked farm machinery and
                    other services. The bottom line was that the farm economy was still sharply
                    restricted and that deficits had to be made up by imports, which I suspect the
                    US helped finance.</p>
                <p>The important point was that Bakaric did not try to defend their policy on
                    economic or ideological grounds, but was, in effect, saying 'don't be naive', we
                    need to keep farms under control to assure continued Communist party rule.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, agriculture was to be increasingly liberalized in subsequent
                    decades and, as a result, returned to prosperity - while the Communist party
                    disappeared as Bakaric had foreseen.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that is fascinating. What was your second experience
                        with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Toward the end of my tour, the US had just given the Yugoslavs a small
                    plastics plant on the outskirts of Zagreb. Although we were invited to the
                    ribbon-cutting, not a word of thanks appeared in the Yugoslav or Croatian press.
                    Indeed, the U.S. role was hardly mentioned in what was pretty extensive
                    coverage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the Yugoslavs never did show much appreciation for
                        the American aid they were getting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Precisely. At a dinner, on the night of the dedication of the plant, at
                    which there were only five or six of us present, Joe Godson confronted Bakaric:
                    “ God damn it, Vladimir! We're giving you all this stuff, and spend millions,
                    and you never once tell your people how much we are actually doing for you!”</p>
                <p>Bakaric again countered with a touch of acid irony: “Gospodin Godson, I thought
                    you were a smart man! Its enough that we know who pays for what!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Clearly, Tito's old guard was still anxious to deny Moscow unnecessary
                    talking points. They were tough, unembarrassed and focused on survival. And, Joe
                    Godson, the professional anti-Communist, understood them well, was able to make
                    convivial contact with them, asked blunt questions, and, in spite of their
                    equally blunt rejoinders, remained respected and usually got our message
                    across.</p>
                <p>vii. The rest of the staff</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he must have been quite a character. Who else was in
                        Zagreb at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Joe Godson's deputy and the post's Economic Officer was Woody White, a
                    nice, rather wobbly man who went with the flow and tried to keep things on an
                    even keel. My immediate boss in our two-man Consular section was David Milbank,
                    a well-educated, hard working young officer who taught me the ropes and made
                    sure I knew what I was doing, since I had forgotten most of what I had learned
                    two years earlier in the Consular Course in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>The undisputed seniors among our locals were Mrs. Gregoric, whose booming voice
                    remains unforgettable, and her more compliant colleague Mrs. Herzog. Having
                    served there for decades they were both genuine authorities on all aspects of
                    consular regulations. It took real courage for a raw Vice Consul to overrule
                    their recommendations, which they appended to each file, and to overcome their
                    subsequent displeasure!</p>
                <p>The powerhouse in the place, however, was Neda Zepic, a thoroughly competent,
                    younger can-do person, who knew lots of people, had lived in Vienna, had a
                    quizzical, sharp-edged sense of humor and endless energy and laughter. While the
                    old guard never really liked her because she made herself so useful to all of
                    us, from Joe Godson on down, we appreciated her greatly for helping with all
                    kinds of projects, even though, unfair as this may have been, one could not be
                    wholly trusting, since we had no idea which of our staff, if not all of them,
                    were regularly reporting to the UDBA (the Yugoslav intelligence service).
                    Indeed, one junior staffer, Anna Aschberger, had to be fired after admitting
                    that she had been an agent - although it was hard to see what else a local could
                    have done under the pressure they were often put under to report.</p>
                <p>Be that as it may, Neda has remained a life-long friend of generations of FSOs
                    who worked with her and came to know her. My wife Pat and I visited her in
                    Zagreb in the late '90's when, long retired, we were assisting with Bosnian
                    elections. Among other things, Neda, now walking with a cane, proudly showed us
                    a warm personal letter of thanks and commendation for her service from Under
                    Secretary Larry Eagleburger, who had been a junior member of the Political
                    Section in Belgrade in my time.</p>
                <p>viii. Zagreb consular work</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the consular work like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Part of it was dealing with the sheer numbers and variety of people who
                    crowded into our small, musty consular space, having often traveled long hours
                    from all over Croatia and Slovenia. Many wanted to visit or emigrate to America,
                    where most had relatives; many more came for passport renewals or to resolve
                    Social Security problems; a few professionals and students turned up who had
                    American job offers or scholarships; and there were the occasional American
                    travelers, who needed help when they had somehow got trouble.</p>
                <p>All were first interviewed by our staff, and given the right forms and papers to
                    fill out before David Milbank or I would the see them; a necessarily slow and
                    tedious process, since all work was still done with clanky typewriters, usually
                    in triplicate with dirty carbon paper and preserved in stacks of ancient file
                    cabinets, while the street cars clanged by outside.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the biggest problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: We had frequent difficulties with the many visitors visa applicants who
                    lacked compelling evidence that they really planned to return and whom we
                    therefore had to refuse. Many of these decisions were necessarily intuitive.</p>
                <p>The most difficult, however, were the citizenship cases because so many Yugoslavs
                    who had gone to work in the US, returned to Yugoslavia to retire on their Social
                    Security pensions, which, at a time when the dollar was so strong, made them
                    relatively rich. Many of them would then foolishly do things forbidden under US
                    citizenship law as it existed at the time. They would swear oaths of allegiance
                    to Yugoslavia to vote in local elections, take some official job or sign up for
                    government programs open only to Yugoslav citizens. Some young ones even got
                    themselves drafted into the army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had dual citizenship problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. The issue would come up when they were questioned in
                    connection with renewal of their passports, or produced passports they had
                    allowed to expire. These poor people, many of them septuagenarians or older,
                    would try to explain: Well, you see, we forgot, or we didn't know, we just did
                    what is normal and swore an oath, or whatever the thing may have been. The
                    trouble was that this unavoidably triggered an 'investigation' and the writing
                    of elaborate 'citizenship opinions', which in many cases led to their having
                    their American citizenship taken away. It was often a heart-rending job which I
                    was glad to leave behind!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any memorable cases of Americans who got in
                        trouble?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The most famous was the case of the lady who was hit by the toilet!</p>
                <p>It involved an elderly American woman and her husband, rare tourists on a swing
                    through Yugoslavia, who were staying at the Palace Hotel near the Consulate
                    General. When using the facilities she pulled the cord and the whole water
                    closet on the wall above her crashed down on her head. As a result she had a bad
                    concussion, spent some time in the hospital and of course raised the issue of
                    compensation for the hotel's evident negligence. The Palace Hotel agreed there
                    was a problem, but argued that there were no provisions under its five-year plan
                    to pay for the damages involved. The issue eventually had to be taken by Joe
                    Godson to the Central Committees of Zagreb and Croatia, until their claims were
                    satisfied.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>The second case was even more bizarre. I received a call one afternoon that an
                    extremely large American woman had fallen off the end of a train in the railway
                    tunnel through the Alps connecting Slovenia with Carinthia in Austria,
                    apparently thinking she was backing into a toilet! She was rescued with some
                    difficulty, taken to a hospital in Ljubljana and put into an enormous plaster
                    body cast, since here spine was broken. The problem then was that the cast's
                    circumference was so wide that she could not be put on any passenger train.
                    After several intense days, the problem was eventually solved with the help of
                    relatives who arranged to fly her to Athens on a plane whose rear gate could
                    just accommodate her.</p>
                <p>Still another involved the Yale Glee club, en route from Zagreb to Belgrade,
                    which was arrested 'en masse' in a village some fifty miles south of Zagreb,
                    because one of their number had tossed a bottle out of their bus window an hit a
                    young peasant bicycling by who suffered a concussion. After first springing the
                    innocent members of the Club, it took me two days of difficult, face-to-face
                    negotiation with a very stubborn official to get the young perpetrator released
                    from the local hoosegow, after making extensive apologies and helping to
                    negotiate the payment of some quite considerable compensation.</p>
                <p>ix. New duties as number two</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like the life of consular officers rarely has a
                        dull moment! What happened in your second year in Zagreb?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: My next promotion came through, to FSO-5, which raised me to the exalted
                    rank of Consul, and I succeeded Woody White as Joe Godson's deputy and Economic
                    Officer. “Chips”, more formally known as John Chapman Chester, replaced me as
                    head of the Consular Section; Jim Fletcher had arrived to take David Milbank's
                    place; and Bob Barry [Robert Barry] and his lovely wife Peggy blew in in a
                    blinding blizzard around Christmas time as an extra hand. Taken together it was
                    a first-rate team. Chips, happily married to his socially and intellectually
                    gifted wife Clara, later became DCM in Malawi and spent many years as a staff
                    member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Bob Barry, thin, brilliant and
                    reserved, was to be even more successful as Consul General in Leningrad, Deputy
                    Director of the Voice of America, Ambassador to Indonesia and Bulgaria and,
                    after his retirement, head of the OSCE (Organization for Security and
                    Cooperation in Europe) Mission in Bosnia and a succession of other trouble
                    spots. Both have remained lifelong friends.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it working directly for Joe Godson?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Not always smooth sailing. Part of it was shielding the staff from Joe's
                    frequent outbursts of sarcasm and wrath, particularly Chips, whom he considered
                    'naive' and 'born with a silver spoon'. Perhaps because of this, I was probably
                    too painstaking from Chips' and Bob's perspective in making sure that all was
                    done properly and on time.</p>
                <p>Then there was Godson's endless war with the USIA!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Our Branch Public Affairs Officer Nealy Turner was, I thought, a
                    competent and rather nice man, who ran his little operation with brio and �lan.
                    It included the very active and popular USIA Library under Corinne Spencer, a
                    delightful old hand who knew Zagreb and its people inside out; visiting art
                    exhibits and performers; student exchanges and some limited PR efforts. The
                    trouble arose from USIA's constant tendency to assert their independence from
                    the State Department, which, in Zagreb, translated into an all-consuming turf
                    battle. Nealy took the view that he worked for his USIA superiors in Belgrade,
                    while Joe felt that, as the Consul General, Nealy was part of his staff and
                    should clear all his activities with him - a classic management problem which
                    should have been worked out on an informal, cooperative basis.</p>
                <p>Instead there were memorable shouting matches, slamming of doors and an ongoing
                    war of personalities between Joe and Nealy and wounding quarrels with the Public
                    Affairs people at the Embassy in Belgrade - notably Walter Roberts, the equally
                    self-important and assertive Public Affairs Officer. The frequent, often angry
                    telephone exchanges between Joe in Zagreb and USIA in Belgrade must have been
                    fun for the UDBA eavesdroppers to listen to.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, working for Godson was also an education in competent, albeit
                    tough-minded political analysis and all sorts of lessons in how and how not to
                    deal with our Yugoslav Communist hosts.</p>
                <p>x. The omnipresent UDBA</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the UDBA, Yugoslavia's secret police,
                        several times. Was it an ongoing problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It set the stage for our work. The general impression of the Tito period
                    is that it was pretty benign, that he was a 'soft' communist, kind of Western,
                    and that this justified or explained why we were giving him aid. The reality at
                    the time was quite different. Actually the UDBA remained a powerful force as
                    Tito's control device and his means of keeping himself informed. We were giving
                    him covert and overt aid, not because he was a nice guy and a Jeffersonian
                    democrat but because he was effectively blocking out the Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent was the UDBA infiltrated or controlled by
                        the Soviet KGB?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That came to light only in 1966, some years after I had left, when
                    Rankovic, one of Tito's closest wartime associate, and the Minister of the
                    Interior, was implicated in bugging Tito's bedroom. In the ensuing scandal it
                    was learned that Rankovic had been a KGB agent, that the UDBA had been
                    controlled by the KGB for a long time and that the Soviets had played a very
                    powerful intelligence game in Yugoslavia throughout this period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this when Rankovic was finally fired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did UDBA operate against you in Zagreb?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Our perception was that they had six or seven intelligence officers
                    working full time against our four or five American officers and one American
                    secretary. Part of this involved standard wiretapping and bugging - for
                    instance, official visitors always ended up in the same numbered rooms, i.e. 9,
                    19, 29 etc. on various floors of the nearby Palace Hotel. Another part was the
                    constant pressure on our local staff, as well as on many of our social guests
                    and neighbors, to report our official doings and personal proclivities. And
                    there were their direct operations. One of their consistent objectives was to
                    find out whether one of us was a CIA officer, and, if so, who it was and what he
                    was up to.</p>
                <p>Curiously we got little sympathy or help from the Embassy, which tended to
                    downplay our reporting of these pressures and thought we were exaggerating.
                    Perhaps the UDBA was more reticent in Belgrade with its large number of
                    diplomatic establishments or the Embassy did not want to undercut Washington
                    support for aid to Yugoslavia. Whatever the reason, the Embassy generally
                    thought we were a little hyper. We did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any examples?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Among the more notable events in Zagreb during this period was the visit
                    of Commerce Secretary Benson for a high-level trade negotiation with Yugoslavia.
                    Although we strongly counseled that their strategy meetings be held outdoors or
                    in a more or less secure area in the Consulate which was regularly swept, he
                    insisted on meeting in the Palace Hotel where they all stayed, and was then
                    upset when the Yugoslav delegation seemed to outmaneuver him at every turn.
                    After they had left our Admin officer found that the chandelier in their meeting
                    room had been studded with listening devices.</p>
                <p>Their direct operations were often nastier. For instance, men in raincoats would
                    try to frighten the wives of some of our people while their husbands were away
                    on official trips and start reading poems about children drowning in rivers.
                    This happened to Mrs. Koch, the wife of the junior USIA officer. Chips Chester
                    reported that his wife received an anonymous, totally untrue letter claiming
                    that he was having an affair with one of our local staff. Sometimes just plain
                    threatening letters were found, or curious near-accidents reported. And we were,
                    of course, routinely followed by teams of cars when we made trips.</p>
                <p>To protest these incidents, either Joe Godson or I we would call on Peter Nemac,
                    the Protocol Chief for Croatia who represented the Foreign Office and had close
                    ties to the UDBA and got brushed off with comments like: “This is all just in
                    your Western imagination. These things are not really happening.” The
                    frustration was that they were, and that we had no means to stop them.</p>
                <p>xi. Rough stuff , and a personal close shave</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the most serious incidents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The most egregious, and from the UDBA's perspective most successful
                    operation, was the seduction of an American secretary and code clerk, which I
                    have already mentioned. The most brutal, during my time in Zagreb, was aimed at
                    the British Consulate General, then headed by Basil Judd, a genial, old
                    diplomat, who had made his career in the Middle East. Judd's problem was that
                    his attractive, rather younger wife was noticeably promiscuous, a fact which had
                    not escaped the UDBA's attention. One day she went to a famous old castle with
                    her latest lover, an UDBA plant. Their tryst was interrupted at its high point
                    by a team of UDBA interrogators who burst into their room, refused to let her
                    get up or get dressed and, in this condition, interrogated her for many hours,
                    all the while taking photographs. What they most wanted to know was who the
                    intelligence officer was on the British staff and what he was doing. Some said
                    she spilled quite a lot of beans. Be that as it may, she was left with a
                    complete nervous breakdown and had to be sent to a British sanatorium. Judd, of
                    whom more later, left promptly thereafter and retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's pretty rough stuff. Did anything ever happen to you
                        personally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: There was one, quite serious incident in my second year, when I had
                    planned to spend a winter weekend in Villach, across the alps in Austria. Since
                    it had snowed I had asked the Croatian Deputy Tourist Minister - who, I later
                    learned, was also a senior UDBA officer - when I ran into him at a reception,
                    which of the Alpine passes would be open. He promised to call back and assured
                    me that the Wurzen Pass was clear.</p>
                <p>So I set off in my little Volkswagen on a clear and very cold Friday night and
                    got up to the first level with growing difficulty, since even to that point the
                    road turned out to be hazardous and was covered with increasingly deep snow.
                    Once on the plateau, where the actual ascent over the pass begins, it became
                    clear that I had been misled, since the road over the pass was snowed in and
                    impassable.</p>
                <p>It was at this point, while I took a few minutes to look at the extraordinarily
                    bright, starlit sky and the icy mountain peaks, that I somehow sensed something
                    was wrong and instinctively jumped back into the car and slammed the door. A
                    second later, the whole car, hood, windshield and all, was covered by a pack of
                    ferocious dogs, which a guard had released without warning to go after me. I
                    gunned the motor, dogs went flying in all direction, got clear and managed to
                    get back down the mountain road. It was a very close shave. Some days later, I
                    again ran into the Deputy Tourist Minister in Zagreb, who asked me with a little
                    smile, how I had enjoyed my trip over the pass!</p>
                <p>xii. The bigger picture</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Life in those days in Zagreb clearly wasn't uneventful!
                        Looking at the bigger picture, what was your general impression of the
                        political atmosphere in Yugoslavia and the opinion towards the U.S. at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The party-controlled media consistently downplayed and were often
                    critical of the US, and only doled out occasional positive reports. Even so the
                    US was widely admired by ordinary people for its democracy and freedom and seen
                    as the dream land of opportunity, where one didn't have the kind of problems
                    they had in Yugoslavia. This was reflected in the consistent success of our USIA
                    Library, the number of people who listened to VOA and RFE, the many visa
                    applicants, the interest shown in American exhibits and musical or ballet
                    performances, as well as in the casual comments many people made. It became most
                    apparent in the huge outpouring of sympathy over President Kennedy's
                    assassination in 1963.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>On Yugoslav domestic issues opinion seemed even more tightly controlled. Although
                    we met lots of people at dinners, parties and receptions, as well as in many
                    informal situations, and heard lots of rumors, few were willing to discuss what
                    was going on in concrete terms. Apart from occasional grumbling, regime jokes or
                    criticism by innuendo, it still paid not to rock the boat. UDBA pressure clearly
                    was effective.</p>
                <p>There were some few - I remember notably a young doctor and his family - who did
                    speak fearlessly of their unhappiness with Yugoslavia's poorly functioning
                    autocratic system and were willing to offer detailed examples. Generally,
                    however, the most outspoken tended to be working class people and peasants, the
                    people who bore the brunt of the country's problems and had the least to lose.
                    They sometimes complained very explicitly about 'conditions' and did not care
                    who was listening.</p>
                <p>xiii. Croatian Nationalism</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Croatian nationalism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: There were occasional hints that Croatian nationalism was still alive
                    under the veneer of Communist conformity. The most significant, in my time in
                    Zagreb, occurred at a performance of 'Zrinski' - a patriotic opera celebrating
                    the heroic death of Croatian Count Zrinski at the hands of the evil Turkish
                    invaders - when the young audience burst forth in raucous cries of 'Nasa
                    Zastava', ('Our flag') instead of the Yugoslav hammer and sickle displayed on
                    the stage - an outcry party officials present failed to quell. We also
                    frequently heard anti-Serbian jokes and complaints that Croatia and Slovenia
                    contributed more than their just share to the national economy, and consistently
                    subsidized the less developed parts of Yugoslavia. And there were occasional
                    whiffs that some senior Croatian officials were pressing Belgrade for further
                    economic liberalization and greater scope for cultural expression.</p>
                <p>But none of this was at a level to suggest the deep underlying ethnic and
                    religious divisions in Yugoslav society of later years, which Milosevic and
                    Tudjman managed to stir up and tap into after Yugoslavia had broken up, which
                    led to the Bosnian war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Referring to the Presidents of Serbia and Croatia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>xiv. Brotherhood and Unity prevailed.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. On the contrary, during the two years I was there, “Bratstvo” and
                    “Jedinstvo” (Brotherhood and Unity ) was still the prevailing ethos. Not only
                    was the slogan everywhere - on red banners, flags, posters and all over the
                    media - but people by and large supported it; first, because only a united
                    Yugoslavia could survive under the then Cold war circumstances; secondly,
                    because there was a degree of economic progress, and thirdly, because of Tito's
                    effective policy of sticks and carrots with which he secured his rule.</p>
                <p>In short, there were nationalist pressures but not on a scale which came even
                    close to destabilizing Yugoslavia. Subsequently declassified National
                    Intelligence Estimates for the period, (see NIE 15-61 and NIE 15-67 available on
                    the National Intelligence Centers website) confirm this. The consensus view in
                    Washington, as among us on the ground, was that Yugoslavia was politically
                    stable and the regime was actually gaining domestic support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see the story in the press the other day about
                        Tito's granddaughter? She supports both Yugoslav unity and democratization,
                        fully realizing the contradictions between the two in such an ethnically
                        diverse region.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Svetlana Broz? Yes. Perhaps in the very long run she will be proven to
                    right, once the harsh edges of the recent war are rounded off, and people again
                    realize that the former Yugoslav Republics were in fact economically quite
                    complementary. Perhaps a new 'bratstvo' and 'jedinstvo' will some day encompass
                    a somewhat larger Balkan region in the shared context of EU membership.</p>
                <p>xv. The Yugoslav disaster could have been avoided.</p>
                <p>JAEGER: I myself have come to the conclusion that the bloody disintegration of
                    Yugoslavia was not inevitable, but the result of two critical factors: The
                    fatally and predictably inadequate succession arrangements, calling for a
                    rotating Presidency, which Tito put in place, which virtually guaranteed the
                    country's disintegration, and Western negligence in not facing up to this
                    problem or reacting to it in time, when it became quite clear that rotating the
                    Presidency between the country's Republics was failing.</p>
                <p>This was all the more surprising, since even we in Zagreb were aware that the
                    succession arrangements after Tito's death would be critically important. As it
                    turned out, there were endless discussions at all levels, but nothing effective
                    was done.</p>
                <p>xvi. Kennan's predictions</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did George Kennan ever talk about these issues when he was
                        Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Your question, Bill, brings to mind one of the most interesting
                    experiences in those two years, when I was asked to accompany Kennan on a three
                    day trip through Croatia and Slovenia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now Kennan became Ambassador about the time you went to
                        Zagreb?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, he arrived a bit earlier, in March of 1961, and served until July
                    1963. On this, his only longer visit during my time, he wanted to meet leading
                    government people, journalists, and other movers and shakers in both Croatia and
                    Slovenia. When we got back to Zagreb after a busy and very pleasant three days,
                    which I had arranged, Kennan surprised me by referring to the trip as “a
                    significant experience!” When I offered to draft a reporting telegram, Kennan
                    surprised me again by saying, “ That won't be necessary, I'll just sit down in
                    your code room, if I may, and write it up.” He emerged after a couple hours with
                    a long hand-written draft and asked me to read it over and tell him what I
                    thought.</p>
                <p>I did, and was absolutely amazed. The people we had met had, with minor
                    exceptions, told us pretty much what the party line then called for. But what
                    Kennan had written was that his trip through this northern region of the country
                    had confirmed his sense of the impending disintegration of Yugoslavia after
                    Tito!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really! That early?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. The thrust was that there were great tensions in the country, and
                    that the people he had seen had given him significant indications of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, the Slovenes were the most separatist element
                        when the breakup came. They really started the trouble because they felt
                        they'd been economically exploited to support the backward regions in the
                        south.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. Basically Croatia and Slovenia were economically supporting
                    Serbia and the rest, a situation which caused some discontent, but not to the
                    extent Kennan's telegram described it. I felt at the time that there was an
                    amazing disparity between what I had heard on the trip and what he had
                    written.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, it may well be that Kennan's antennae were finer than mine, or
                    that the inherent logic of the situation had led him to this far-reaching
                    conclusion which he then wanted to document. Even so, he got the timing wrong,
                    because he thought the crisis was clearly more imminent than it actually turned
                    out to be. Still, his was the first explicit warning, as far as I know, of what
                    was to come.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>Needless to say, the report was greeted with skepticism, both in the Embassy -
                    which didn't believe that nationalism was very powerful at the time and usually
                    asked us to tone down our occasional reports of Croatian nationalist behavior -
                    as well as in Washington.</p>
                <p>xvii. Kennan, the Embassy and State</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hmm. They didn't much appreciate him in the Department,
                        did they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Kennan's personally written telegrams often reached entirely different
                    conclusions than the Embassy's routine reporting. As his 'Memoirs' make clear he
                    saw the Embassy diplomatic and USIA staff as “being from another generation”,
                    people, he wrote, “who had come up in a different sort of bureaucratic
                    environment: Less human, less personal, vaster, more inscrutable, less
                    reassuring. Some of them tended initially ..... to be wary, correct, faithfully
                    pedantic, but withdrawn and in a sense masked. The studied absence of color, in
                    personality and in uttered thought, had become a protective camouflage. But of
                    course they were real people underneath, and in most instances very valuable and
                    intelligent ones....”.</p>
                <p>Tellingly, not one of them is mentioned in his 'Memoirs' by name even though it
                    was a first-rate team, which included Eric Kocher, his competent DCM, Walter
                    Roberts the assertive and flamboyant PAO, and a Political Section headed by
                    shrewd and perceptive Alex Johnpoll, whose members included the highly
                    articulate, if somewhat self-important Jim Lowenstein, later a prominent
                    Congressional staffer, and a young, discouraged Larry Eagleburger, later
                    Secretary of State, who did not hide the fact that felt badly underused. Indeed,
                    I remember a lunch in Belgrade at which Larry complained that he was on the
                    verge of quitting the Foreign Service. It was I who told him to toughen up and
                    hang in there, which he did.</p>
                <p>In sum, there was a basic, rather sad disconnect between Kennan and the
                    staff.</p>
                <p>Some of this may have been due to the fact that Kennan saw himself by then as an
                    agent of historic transformation and had come to Belgrade with his own agenda:
                    To restore mutually confident American-Yugoslav relations, implying a larger
                    strategy of wresting it still further away from the USSR. The symbol and
                    centerpiece of the policy was to be most-favored-nation status for
                    Yugoslavia.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>What this did not adequately take into account was the continuing deep distrust
                    of anything 'Communist' in Congress, feelings kept alive by hyper-active
                    Croatian and Serbian �migr� groups in the US; and the fact that Yugoslav
                    Communist behavior did not always lend itself to benign interpretation from
                    Washington's perspective. Tito's leadership of the non-aligned movement, his
                    repressive domestic policies and his refusal to ally himself with the West all
                    contributed to this. Although Kennan fought hard, his effort foundered on these
                    obstacles, leaving him feeling betrayed by the Department, which, of course, had
                    to deal pragmatically with the political realities as they existed at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>Taken together, all this led to important misunderstandings with the Department's
                    Eastern European people and eventually to his unhappy departure from Belgrade,
                    feeling that he had not been appreciated or understood.</p>
                <p>Kennan was a brilliant seer, advisor on major issues and interpreter of history,
                    but, for all that, fatally indifferent to the short-term stuff which makes up
                    the daily fare of government bureaucracy. As a result he became a tragic figure
                    in American diplomacy, who, although he shaped the post-war world as much as
                    anyone, spent most of his career at odds with the State Department and later in
                    prestigious Princeton exile.</p>
                <p>xviii: Archbishop Seper and the Church</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that all fits in. How about relations with
                        Church?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: One of the things Joe Godson asked me to undertake was to maintain
                    relations with Zagreb's Archbishop, the Croatian Primate Franjo Seper, who was
                    the successor to Cardinal Stepinac. Seper was made Cardinal by Paul VI in 1965
                    and appointed Prefect of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith in 1968.
                    Although a generally orthodox theologian, he supported religious freedom from
                    state control and the vernacular mass during the Second Vatican Council - no
                    doubt reflecting his ample experience with a state which tried to control the
                    Church and suppressed expressions of Croatian identity. I found him to be a
                    modest, kindly, welcoming man whose empathy and human touch helped make him a
                    well-liked and widely respected prelate. For me, his sense of the profound
                    historical drama involved in the Church's conflict with atheistic Communism,
                    indeed his extensive theological and historical knowledge of Croatian and Balkan
                    history made my conversations with him especially rewarding.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>Archbishop Seper received me a number of times and seemed to enjoy our
                    conversations. His main concern was the constant surveillance he and his priests
                    were subjected to by the UDBA and the limits party functionaries constantly
                    tried to place on Church activities. But even in these difficult periods he
                    retained his confidence in the faith of the Croatian people and the ability of
                    the Church to survive. One day, after coffee and cake in his study, he took me
                    for a walk around Zagreb cathedral and pointed to its massive foundations.
                    These, he said, have been here for a thousand years and will still be hear a
                    thousand years from now.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, Cardinal Seper survived Tito's death in 1980 by a year, and so
                    must have been aware that Yugoslav communism's force, as Stepinac and he had
                    experienced it, was spent. That the Church in Croatia then too became identified
                    with the worst aspects Croatian nationalism is yet another story.</p>
                <p>xix. Chips Chester: God's hero in Glina!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware of any anti-religious incidents
                        yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: One day we received an official invitation to the rededication of the
                    Orthodox church in Glina, a village in Croatia's southern borderland, where the
                    Croatian Ustashi (the ferociously brutal Croatian-Nazi front which had worked in
                    tandem with the German occupying Army in world War II) had committed one of
                    their most infamous wartime atrocities. The church was burnt down while hundreds
                    of Serbs they had rounded up were locked inside, all of whom perished
                    horribly.</p>
                <p>After the war American Serb �migr� groups financed the church's reconstruction.
                    As it was, neither the Consul General, nor I were free to attend, so I asked my
                    good friend Chips Chester if he would go and represent the US. In mid-afternoon
                    I received a call from the Protocol Chief, Peter Nemac, to protest the
                    “outrageous” behavior of our Vice Consul Mr. Chester during the dedication
                    ceremonies. I told him I would get back to him.</p>
                <p>When Chips turned up a bit later he told the following tale: “Well, it was all
                    kind of amusing. They had built this platform with Communist banners in front of
                    the new church, facing a field filled with 'babushkas' (Croatian peasant women)
                    all of whom were looking down rather despondently at the ground. On the platform
                    were officials from the Central Committee of Croatia and the region, selected
                    leaders of the American Serb �migr� community, several important locals, an
                    Orthodox bishop and a couple of his priests, and then there was me.”</p>
                <p>I said, “So what happened? Why are they so mad?”</p>

                <p>He said, “Well, when it came time to make speeches each of the officials, as well
                    as the co-opted clergy, spoke in turn about this and that, but nobody mentioned
                    God. So I thought to myself, since I was the last to be asked to speak that I
                    would say something about God, so I ended my short remarks with, 'God bless this
                    church, God be with you!'"</p>
                <p>At that point, Chips recounted, the babushkas, in fact the whole village and even
                    some of the officials, rose up en masse and began</p>
                <p>cheering because they had been waiting for someone finally to say something about
                    what a church is really all about.</p>
                <p>I thought this was just great and was very proud of Chips! I told Mr. Nemac that
                    my Vice Consul had done just splendidly! I think Glina also helped get Chips his
                    next promotion in the Foreign Service!</p>

                <p>xx.Seizing a merchant ship</p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, my seizure of an American merchant ship! I don't exactly remember
                    when it happened in my second year, but we received a report one day that there
                    had been a mutiny on an American-owned freighter which had just put into port in
                    Rijeka.</p>
                <p>As you may know, consular officers are among many other things 'protectors of
                    seamen' under legal provisions which go far back in American law, and have
                    considerable powers, including the ability to detain ships, to carry out this
                    responsibility. Since an American investigation was clearly necessary, I ordered
                    the ship to remain in Rijeka under the authority vested in Consuls, and asked
                    the master and the crew to come to Zagreb to be interviewed. This provoked a
                    flurry of telegrams and phone calls from owners, insurance companies,
                    politicians and other interested parties protesting this action and asking that
                    the ship be released and sent on its way!</p>
                <p>It turned out after a couple of days of recorded meetings with officers and crew,
                    that there had been serious abuses by the former and increasingly mutinous
                    reactions from the latter. We submitted these conclusions to Washington and,
                    after consultation, released the ship with instructions that both officers and
                    crew were to cease all offensive behavior and with the further stipulation that
                    it stop in a series of ports on its return to the States, where local American
                    consular officers would visit the ship and assure that conditions were peaceful
                    enough to allow it to proceed. How it all got sorted out by the US Coast Guard
                    and in the maritime courts I never found out.</p>

                <p>xxi. The Cuba crisis</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Consuls really do do all sorts of things! On another
                        subject, were you in Zagreb during the Cuba crisis? What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It was, without question, one of the most exciting and fraught 24 hours I
                    lived through in my Foreign Service career. It occurred in the third week of
                    October '62. Joe Godson and his wife had decided to go on leave in Rome, so, as
                    his deputy, I was temporarily in charge. I remember, his parting shot as he got
                    into his car: “Nothing important is likely to happen, so you ought to be able to
                    manage!”</p>
                <p>A couple of days later the Cuba crisis broke. As the situation escalated, and we
                    were trying to stay abreast of the reams of telegrams flooding in, our local
                    staff brought in reports that there were thousands of 'students' massing at the
                    university with instructions to be ready to storm the American Consulate.
                    Subsequent scouting trips confirmed these reports of large crowds waving
                    anti-American banners, being exhorted by party activists to move against us when
                    the crisis became critical. Needless to say I sent urgent messages to Belgrade
                    and Washington. The situation was dangerous, since we had no Marines or safe
                    rooms and our corner building, facing one of Zagreb's busiest streets, was
                    completely exposed.</p>
                <p>The tension mounted by the hour as the standoff between the Soviet Union and
                    Washington continued and the Soviet ships continued to steam toward Cuba. Early
                    on in the crisis I sent our locals home, leaving only us five Americans in the
                    building. We burnt the most sensitive materials and began to barricade doors and
                    windows. In the meantime our young Administrative officer began to make rope
                    ladders in case it should become necessary to escape through the rear windows of
                    the building into the adjoining backyards, which conceivably could offer an
                    escape route.</p>
                <p>Then, when we had done what we could, we waited. The key question was, of course,
                    whether to abandon the building and let it be overrun, or to stand our ground?
                    In the end, after we had all discussed the pros and cons, I decided we would
                    stand our ground, and try to escape over the rope ladders only at the last
                    minute. It was a hair-brained scheme, but, who knows, it might have worked.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>It was in this atmosphere, with steadily growing pressure on us and across the
                    world as the day proceeded, that we suddenly got the news that the USSR had
                    blinked! The Soviet ships had turned around and the Cuba crisis was over. Almost
                    simultaneously the massed crowds who had been threatening us simply vanished,
                    and the assault on the Consulate never took place. Tito had clearly meant to
                    make a measured gesture of support to Khrushchev with a 'spontaneous' assault on
                    the small American post in Zagreb, rather than risking a major confrontation by
                    threatening the Embassy. When Khrushchev caved, Tito immediately called off the
                    dogs.</p>
                <p>That night, we, and the rest of Zagreb's consular corps, which included several
                    Iron Curtain countries, as well as a number of Croatian officials, were invited
                    for drinks at the British Consulate General. When my colleagues and I walked
                    into Basil Judd's richly carpeted reception room there was only a terrible
                    silence, since the various Communists present probably hadn't been told yet how
                    to react. I will never forget lovable old Judd standing on the other side of the
                    huge Persian carpet booming out: “Jolly good show, Yanks! I knew you could do
                    it!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: There was polite clapping from the Communist side and only somewhat
                    greater enthusiasm from our Western allies, some of whom had waffled during the
                    crisis and most of whom were still in shock. It was thus that the Cuban crisis
                    ended in Zagreb.</p>
                <p>I have always remembered this moment and was sorry and angry over Basil's
                    subsequent fate at the hands of the UDBA. He was a wonderful old man and a
                    seasoned friend.</p>
                <p>xxii. The Zagreb Trade Fair</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then your tour of Zagreb ended in '63?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Actually in February '64, since I was asked to stay a few extra months
                    beyond my two-year assignment to help Joe Godson with the big annual job of
                    backstopping our representation at the Zagreb Trade Fair where we had an
                    American pavilion.</p>
                <p>It was a big deal. Lots of American and other companies from many other countries
                    came and showed the many thousands of people who visited what American and other
                    non-communist economies could achieve, in contrast to the stodgy and by and
                    large backward Iron Curtain and Soviet exhibits. It of course created openings
                    for communication between Croatian and western firms and was heavily covered by
                    the press, since the Fair was a major official event. So it was worthwhile all
                    around and part of the price the Tito regime had to pay to maintain essential
                    productive contacts with the Western economies.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>Getting everything coordinated and set up in time involved massive work but was
                    one of the most useful things the Consulate did.</p>
                <p>xxiii. Tuskanac, Ivanka and good-byes</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was your personal life in your last year in
                        Zagreb?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: With my last promotion had come a move to a lovely villa on Tuskanac, a
                    winding, tree-lined street in the upscale part of Zagreb in the gently rising
                    hills above the town. It had a terrace, a walled garden a few trees and even a
                    swimming pool. In short, it was a great improvement over the gloomy third-floor
                    apartment in the Consulate. With the help of Ivanka, who came along as my
                    housekeeper and cook, I was now able to do quite a bit of entertaining,
                    sometimes, when the weather was clement, on the terrace and around the pool -
                    occasioning some complaints from the aged nuns who were my neighbors to the
                    north and the irascible Croatian general to the south, both of whom were used to
                    and expected silence. The most memorable evening on Tuskanac was the traditional
                    New Years eve stag dinner for twelve which Ivanka produced. It involved a whole
                    suckling pig, baked in the local baker's oven, which graced the center of our
                    table and a bottle of Dalmatian red at every place. Needless to say it was a
                    great success.</p>
                <p>The story would not be complete without an end-note on Ivanka. As I said earlier,
                    she was the second wife of Zagreb's preeminent barber Stefan Skudas, a solemn
                    little man generally dressed in black, who, after the death of his first wife,
                    had acquired her in her native Slavonian village. Although Stefan must have had
                    quite a good income, she was almost immediately sent off to work and eventually
                    became a prized domestic for successive Americans at the Consulate. Besides
                    being a good-hearted, generous person and an indefatigable worker, I quickly
                    discovered that she was an excellent cook and, most importantly, intensely
                    loyal. None of us ever suspected her of being an UDBA informer.</p>
                <p>Indeed she would regularly tell us how they had called her in again and again,
                    and recount how she had frustrated or circumvented their questions. Although she
                    loved her Slavonian homeland, she had no more use for the Ustashi who ruled
                    there during World War II than for the UDBA of our time. She told me one day of
                    the Ustashi concentration camp which existed during World War II not far from
                    her village when she was still a girl. In spite of the great dangers involved,
                    she would sneak up to the barbed wire fence and, risking her life, bring food to
                    the half-starved Jewish children. She was of that sturdy peasant generation,
                    more Hapsburg than modern in their attitudes, who still had a strong sense of
                    right and wrong, knew who they were and believed in giving full measure. I was
                    very fortunate that she decided I was worth while taking care of.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then your tour in Zagreb came to and end.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, in February 1964, with a wonderful good-bye party. To celebrate the
                    occasion my colleagues had draped a big room in Joe Godson's residence with a
                    huge Communist-style red banner, inscribed as usual with a slogan in gold
                    letters. Instead of the customary “Workers of the World Unite”, however, this
                    one was a play on the Croatian word “pupak”, meaning “belly button”, whose
                    improbable plural “pupci”, had lately become an in-house source of amusement at
                    the Consulate. So the banner read” “Pupci svjeta ujedinjete se!”, or
                    “Bellybuttons of the world unite!” Although clearly making fun of the usual
                    tiresome propaganda banners, even the Communist officials present took it in
                    good stride.</p>
                <p>c. Off to Washington and Aviation!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened to you next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: To my great surprise I had, after some home leave, been assigned to the
                    Aviation Division of the State Department's Economic Bureau, an assignment all
                    the more startling because I was really not an economist, although I had done
                    some economic work in both Monrovia and Zagreb, and certainly knew nothing about
                    aviation. I reported there in late February 1964.</p>
                <p>The Aviation Division's main job was to negotiate and monitor the growing number
                    of comprehensive bilateral aviation agreements, which defined reciprocal route
                    structures, capacities, frequencies of service, landing rights and so forth, in
                    conformance with prevailing perceptions of US interest - since both domestic and
                    international aviation was then still largely government controlled.</p>
                <p>My new boss, John Snowden, the Director of this seven or eight man office, was a
                    long time, taciturn civil servant, who had been involved in aviation
                    administration virtually his entire career, so was a major authority. Although
                    the work was nominally divided among the members of his staff by region and
                    airline, he was clearly the ultimate decider.</p>
                <p>It was obvious from the outset, that, he didn't have a clue as to what to do with
                    me, and had no intention of making an effort to teach me even the basics of this
                    highly technical and complicated field. I was given a desk only after several
                    days and for several weeks did literally nothing except read telegrams and wait
                    for somebody to tell me what to do. If the State Department wanted to send
                    Snowden a totally unprepared and unqualified officers, his reply was, so be
                    it.</p>
                <p>i. Saving Loftleidir</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any idea why you were assigned to this operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Absolutely not a clue!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It was not until several weeks after my arrival, during which I had
                    complained more and more loudly about having nothing to do, that I was finally
                    told that I could work on the Icelandic question. The issue was that PanAm had
                    filed a series of complaints against Loftleidir, the tiny cut-rate Icelandic
                    airline, and wanted us to produce the necessary adverse findings.</p>
                <p>So I threw myself into that. I read the files and listened to both sides who came
                    in to explain their positions. Essentially PanAm's complaint was that Loftleidir
                    underbid it on the Atlantic route by using older, slower planes and charging
                    cheaper prices and that all this was taking a small bite out of its apple.
                    Loftleidir argued that they were our NATO allies; that, given their mid-Atlantic
                    position, they needed air communications with both America and Europe; and that
                    it was natural that they should charge less than the official rate structure
                    called for, since they flew different routes and their slower and less
                    comfortable planes were the only ones they could afford. Nevertheless, I quickly
                    gathered, the prevailing view in the American aviation community was that we
                    should just kill them off and let Pan Am rule the waves.</p>
                <p>When it became clear that I was not just going with the flow, but taking my time
                    and seriously studying the issue before making recommendations, PanAm reinforced
                    its point with invitations to some of Washington's best clubs, where I enjoyed
                    some very good oysters and excellent red wines. Their rep made the further major
                    mistake of referring to some classified telegrams I had just written to our
                    Embassy in Reykjavik, making it clear that PanAm had its own real-time pipeline
                    into the State Department!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you recommend?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, all my experience told me that that this sort of question shouldn't
                    just be resolved on a purely technical basis of equipment and prices, which was
                    the standard aviation policy approach, but that we also needed to take our
                    strategic interests in Iceland into account as a geographically important NATO
                    partner,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>JAEGER: So I wrote a very strong memorandum arguing that Iceland was a crucial
                    strategic partner, that it needed to have air service to Europe and America,
                    that Icelandic Airlines provided a reliable, useful service for a segment of
                    Americans who couldn't afford to travel on PanAm, and that, in any case, the
                    harm to Pan Am's profits was negligible. To my surprise, and his credit, Snowden
                    signed off on it, it went up the line and Dean Rusk, the then Secretary of State
                    approved it. Icelandic airlines was saved!</p>
                <p>d. Staff Assistant in the European Bureau</p>
                <p>JAEGER: Having won my battle I, nevertheless, felt strongly that I didn't want to
                    spend two more years in this very specialized business. My free time roaming the
                    corridors paid off, since after some months, I heard that William Tyler, the
                    formidable Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs was looking for a
                    new Staff Assistant. I applied, he interviewed me and to my delight and surprise
                    I got the job. What's more, I had again been promoted , that spring to FSO-4. So
                    things were very much back on track when I started my new assignment in 'EUR' in
                    September 1964.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the European Bureau's area of responsibility in
                        those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: A huge chunk of the world and of American foreign policy: All of Western
                    and Eastern Europe, the USSR and its European satellites, Canada, as well as a
                    grab-bag of Europe's various remaining colonies.</p>
                <p>i. Bill Tyler</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what about Bill Tyler, what was he like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: He was exceptional: A carefully groomed, invariably polite, cultivated,
                    broadly educated man, he looked a bit like Monsieur Poirot, with his little
                    mustache, precise manners and somewhat European demeanor. Born in France and
                    bilingual, Tyler was that rare combination of someone who not only had the
                    organizational ability and intellectual precision to deal with the multiplicity
                    of issues which running European affairs entailed, but who brought sound
                    political and cultural instincts and historic depth to the job. He was a genuine
                    diplomat and, for juniors like myself, both a model to emulate and somewhat
                    intimidating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He sounds interesting and unusual. Do you know anything
                        more about his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>JAEGER: His education was English, Harrow and then Oxford, where he studied
                    philosophy, politics and economics. Then a stint with a bank in New York, which
                    he didn't much like, which decided him to get a PhD in art history at Harvard.
                    Before finishing, having failed his physical for the wartime draft, he
                    volunteered to do the French short-wave service for a private radio station in
                    Boston. It was soon taken over by the US Office of War Information (OWI), where
                    Tyler managed the radio output for several countries. He was then sent to run
                    OWI's radio operation in Algiers aimed at France, Italy and Spain, as well as
                    the German troops in Africa and elsewhere. After our invasions of Sicily and
                    France, he went on to London with OWI. Although he had hoped to go back to
                    Harvard after the war, he never did and stayed on in senior positions with USIA,
                    into which OWI had indirectly morphed, until a took his Foreign Service Exam,
                    for transfer from the FS Reserve, and was integrated as Class 1. Once in the
                    Foreign Service he became Political Counselor in Bonn, then Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary in EUR. He was moved up to Assistant Secretary in the spring of
                    1962.</p>
                <p>ii. The Staff Assistant's job</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What, in those days, did the Staff Assistant to an
                        Assistant Secretary do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Assistant Secretaries nowadays have Special Assistants, ordinary
                    Assistants, and sometimes the assistants have assistants. In my days there was
                    one Staff Assistant, and I was it. Halfway through my tour a beginning officer,
                    a brand-new FSO-8, was assigned to help me, a very good chap, but not yet ready
                    to play any substantive role. That was the extent of Bill Tyler's staff, which
                    also supported his three Deputies, Richard Davis, the Eastern Europeanist, Bob
                    Schaetzel, the passionately articulate Europeanist, and Bob Creel, the most
                    junior of the three, a competent no-nonsense guy who did everything else.</p>
                <p>My first priority, of course, was the Assistant Secretary. Hundreds of telegrams,
                    staff papers and other reports had to be screened by the time he came to the
                    office, which meant that I usually had to be there at six or six-fifteen, plow
                    through all the paper which had come in overnight, and have the most important
                    20 or 30 telegrams and reports, the things he really needed to be aware of,
                    ready for him before he went to the Secretary's and Under Secretary's staff
                    meetings at eight.</p>
                <p>Needless to say this made for a fairly stressful start, particularly in the
                    beginning, when I was not yet sure of my judgement as to what was critical and
                    likely to come up for discussion. Over time it became more routine, although,
                    even at best, the days were extremely long - usually fourteen hours or more -
                    and were invariably marked by unexpected flaps and crises.</p>
                <p>All this made it critically important to have good human relations with EUR's
                    Office Directors and key action officers, who were the key players in producing
                    quick responses, as well as the never-ending stream of briefing books and
                    memoranda for the Secretary, the President etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>Of these the most important was the Office of Political/Military Affairs, (RPM),
                    because it handled the major controversies then raging over nuclear issues and
                    their management within the NATO alliance. It was then headed by David Popper,
                    knowledgeable and clear-headed, and had a cast of luminaries: George Vest, a
                    sagacious, very able senior officer, who later became Assistant Secretary for
                    Europe himself, Vince Baker, a slightly sardonic, omniscient sage and Ron
                    Spiers, Tyler's prot�g� and arguably the brightest guy at State. Like Tyler, Ron
                    had moved into the Foreign Service laterally after a rapid rise through the
                    nuclear weapons world. After several major Ambassadorships Ron ended his career
                    rather counter-intuitively as Under Secretary for Management.</p>
                <p>Other Offices also played major roles, notably BNA, which handled our complex
                    special relations with Britain and the Commonwealth; GER, under Al Puhan, on the
                    Berlin and German issues which were at the heart of most cold War discussions
                    and was a power center of its own; SOV and EE , who respectively handled our
                    complex relations with the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites and
                    Yugoslavia; as well as the major country desks, like France, Greece and
                    Turkey.</p>
                <p>iii. Working with 'SS'- the Secretary's Executive Secretariat</p>
                <p>JAEGER: My most difficult ongoing challenge was to get all these important and
                    self-important tigers to do their thing to meet Tyler's and the Secretary's
                    needs, which meant producing needed staff paper in the proper formats and on
                    time - an often difficult and sometimes fractious task , since most of them were
                    constantly overworked and stressed, and often had their own, strong ideas as to
                    priorities and how issues should be argued and presented.</p>
                <p>This problem - the basic challenge for people in staff capacities - was
                    compounded by the Executive Secretariat (SS), which controlled the paper flow to
                    the 'seventh floor', (the offices of the Secretary, his Deputies and the
                    Counselor) and imposed strict rules as to length, format and organization. EUR's
                    action officer in SS at the time was Dick Moose, later himself Assistant
                    Secretary for Africa, a strong, articulate personality with a special gift for
                    concise writing, who sternly enforced the rules and insisted that memoranda
                    could only be a page long, no matter what the substance, and even limited
                    attachments.</p>
                <p>Given the complexity of many of EUR's issues this obviously created problems.
                    People like George Vest or Ron Spiers, or some of the other senior eminences
                    would prepare closely argued memos on major issues, which Tyler would want Dean
                    Rusk, George Ball or McGeorge Bundy in the White House to read in full, to
                    assure that they had the correct context for this or that question and
                    recommendation. Even so, if they were more than a page long, or, in Dick's view,
                    loose or dense, he would draw red lines across them, and send them back with
                    notations like: “Wordy, too long, rewrite by 5 PM.”</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That put you sort of the middle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. I would then have to go back to our people and ask them to
                    rewrite under, at times, excruciating time pressures. Their substantive
                    complaint was that SS's rules were unsound because complex questions should not
                    be compressed to a page. SS's response was also reasonable, that people like the
                    Secretary simply didn't have the time to plow through piles of long epistles.
                    For me it was a no-win situation. Even so, both Bill Tyler and most of the
                    Office Directors understood the conflicting pressures I was under, and did not
                    hold it against me personally.</p>
                <p>The lesson was, of course, that Secretariats can be too devoted to form and so
                    damage the substance of what can make a foreign office great.</p>
                <p>iv. Working with Tyler</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your personal relationship with Tyler?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Tyler was invariable kind and thoughtful, but did not always clue me in
                    on what he was doing. He clearly wanted a Staff Assistant, not an Executive
                    Assistant. At the same time he was aware of the constant pressures I was under
                    and sometimes showed his appreciation by coming by to ask how things were going,
                    or giving me invitations to events he could not go to personally. It was thus
                    that I came to attend an art auction where the extensive collection of a
                    recently deceased Italian Ambassador was sold, where I acquired a beautiful
                    Rembrandt engraving and a genuine Durer woodcut, for the amazing sum of $200.
                    They are still in my study as I write.</p>
                <p>He also showed his confidence in other ways. On a number of occasions when he was
                    very troubled by developments, he would give me an open, hand written note to
                    the Secretary, usually containing only four or five sentences, and ask me to
                    give it only to Dean Rusk's Personal Assistant, bypassing the whole system and
                    underscoring that the issue involved, in Tyler's view, was of the greatest
                    importance.</p>
                <p>v. A non-starter: the Multilateral Nuclear Force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Leaving the procedural issues, what were the main
                        substantive issues EUR was involved in at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>JAEGER: The core issue was the battle over the MLF, the European Multilateral
                    Nuclear Force.</p>
                <p>It arose because the growing number of American nuclear weapons deployed in
                    Europe during the Eisenhower administration made many in Europe feel like
                    potential Soviet nuclear targets, without having any effective control over the
                    weapons deployed on their soils. This increased the risks of nuclear
                    proliferation in Europe and, with it, increased splintering of its tentatively
                    evolving unity.</p>
                <p>The MLF was dreamed up in Washington to defuse these issues and encourage greater
                    European defense cooperation. It would also, it was hoped, give West Germany a
                    reasonable level of participation in the management of NATO's nuclear weapons,
                    and so preempt any German temptations to go nuclear. And it might, just
                    possibly, assuage French resentment over American unilateral control of nuclear
                    weapons on French soil, an irritant which was a major factor in de Gaulle's
                    decision to evict the NATO command from France in 1966 and to create his own
                    force de frappe in 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did MLF propose to do all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, the idea was to create a multilateral submarine or surface fleet
                    armed with nuclear weapons under multinational NATO command, manned by
                    multinational crews representing all NATO nations.</p>
                <p>Needless to say the proposal raised a host of complicated new issues, i.e. how
                    NATO could make the requisite launch decisions, particularly if there was a lack
                    of unanimity; how multinational command would work; whether multinational crews
                    would be able to overcome language and political differences sufficiently to
                    function in a crisis; whether the use of submarines would not leave the
                    impression that the US still controlled the show, since we alone could build
                    them (the reason President Kennedy rejected this option and preferred a fleet of
                    MLF surface ships built in Europe, even though they would be more vulnerable to
                    a Soviet strike); how to satisfy British demands for a continued special nuclear
                    relationship etc.</p>
                <p>Underlying these and other important but technical issues was the broader
                    question of creating a viable united Europe, which could in time become a full
                    partner of the US. The Europeanists on both sides of the Atlantic thought the
                    MLF pointed to the answer, since a new NATO-led nuclear force might in time
                    become the training ground and then the backbone of the new Europe's military
                    power and so provide the critical element in 'Europe's' further evolution.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>As it turned out, the MLF inflamed rather than lessened Allied disagreements. The
                    French were flatly opposed, while the United Kingdom wanted serious revisions,
                    protecting their special role. Efforts to resolve the host of unanswered
                    technical questions and to work out a compromise among U.S., British and German
                    views consumed most of 1964 and 1965. In the end, the MLF project sank under its
                    own weight and proved unworkable politically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All this must have provoked intense debates in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>vi. The MLF debate in Washington</p>
                <p>JAEGER: The intense debates swirling around these issues divided the folks in
                    Washington as much as the Europeans. The core supporters of MLF, were an
                    in-group of passionate 'Europeanists' who wanted to bring about the rapid
                    creation of a united Europe. The were led by George Ball, the then
                    Undersecretary at State and Robert Bowie, who headed Policy Planning, Henry Own,
                    of Bowie's Staff (who had been my distinguished predecessor years earlier when I
                    was made Secretary of Allan Evan's Estimates group in INR) and Bob Schaetzel,
                    Tyler's Deputy for European and Atlantic issues in EUR. Beyond this core group
                    were a host of lesser fry in RPM and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Ranged generally on the other side were McGeorge Bundy in the White House, my
                    boss Bill Tyler and Ron Spiers, none of whom opposed MLF ideologically, but had
                    various levels of skepticism as to its wisdom and feasibility. Secretary of
                    Defense McNamara also became a skeptic. Dean Rusk supported the official line,
                    took little interest and stayed generally above the fray.</p>
                <p>In effect the battle lines cut right across our office. And it was an intense,
                    ongoing battle. Everyone agreed that the nuclear issues in Europe required
                    rethinking, but that's pretty much where agreement ended. And, since President
                    Johnson or Secretary Rusk left the issue unresolved, the 'Europeanists' had time
                    to use their extensive official and private contact networks to keep the battle
                    going as issue after issue came to the forefront.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it became an intense lobbying contest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. On one side was the official traffic. On the other, a constant
                    stream of informal communications to key Europeans, and like-minded
                    'Europeanist' members in our Embassies in those countries, explaining what the
                    other side was doing, or would be doing next, advising them on strategies and
                    setting out next steps. The whole thing became a diplomatic mess of the first
                    order.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were again in the middle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Right. Bill Tyler, a concise and logical thinker, was clearly aware of
                    MLF's many problems, of which the first and foremost was that it would be
                    extremely hazardous in an East-West confrontation to rely on MLF for effective
                    decision-making and execution, when you have a medley of people from every
                    corner of Europe who could delay or frustrate. The result could not but weaken
                    the credibility of our deterrent.</p>
                <p>Bob Schaetzel, two doors away, on the other hand was passionately committed to
                    the project, and constantly in touch with Bowie, Henry Owen, etc. and with their
                    many contacts across the Atlantic, passing on information and coordinating next
                    steps. The result was a high level of mutual distrust and things often got
                    heated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: In all kinds of ways. First, because, as Tyler's Staff Assistant, my
                    loyalty was to him, and most of Schaetzel's effort was aimed at outflanking him.
                    Secondly, because I too thought the MLF was a Rube Goldberg construct bound to
                    fail, which did not deserve support. And, most importantly, because I was the
                    custodian of Tyler's telegrams and papers.</p>
                <p>Some of them were NODIS, which meant they were totally privileged traffic, to be
                    seen by no one except the Assistant Secretary, unless he decided otherwise.
                    Tyler and his British, and other European counterparts used this channel for
                    their most private exchanges. I was therefore often opportuned for “just a quick
                    look”, and always refused.</p>
                <p>One day I came back from lunch and found Bob Schaetzel, Henry Owen and other
                    pro-MLF 'Europeanists' pawing through Tyler's NODIS file, which they had filched
                    from my safe. They looked like a bunch of kids caught with their fingers in the
                    cookie jar. The argument was that senior people can't be kept from reading
                    diplomatic traffic. I countered that these were exclusively the Assistant
                    Secretary's messages. The thing ended in a huge row between Schaetzel and Tyler
                    whom I, of course, had to inform. It was one of a series of events which
                    gradually made his situation in EUR untenable.</p>
                <p>vii. Losing the battle and winning the war</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What else was going on during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>JAEGER: There was a welter of other, greater and lesser issues, ranging from
                    US-Soviet relations, to Germany and Berlin, the Satellites and Yugoslavia, US
                    relations with Canada, and the fuss over Cheddi Jagan, the controversial Prime
                    Minister of Brutish Guiana, whom Washington opposed because of alleged Soviet
                    links, who consumed an inordinate amount of time. All of these issues worked
                    against the background of the Vietnam war which constantly preoccupied our
                    diplomatic work in Europe as elsewhere in the world.</p>
                <p>But the core concern was the resolution of the nuclear uncertainties in Europe,
                    which had been greatly aggravated by the new American doctrine of flexible
                    response, which made it much more important, from the European perspective, to
                    have some say over when to pull the trigger. Ron Spiers later floated and put
                    over the idea of a NATO Nuclear Planning Group (NPG) which has helped greatly in
                    involving the allies in nuclear issues over the years.</p>
                <p>Tyler handled it all deftly and honestly, but in the end paid the price for his
                    good judgement and integrity. As the MLF was sinking, he was abruptly replaced
                    by John Leddy, an economist from the 'European' camp. We were all shocked and
                    crestfallen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That happened in May 1965. Time or one of the major magazines said in a
                    comment on his departure that 'the last light was going out at State'. I think I
                    was the only one still in the office on the night he actually left. He smiled
                    and said, “Well, George, here is the glow worm turning off!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you most value about this experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Although I had been doing staff and not policy work, I learned an
                    enormous amount.</p>
                <p>Part of it was that the job was one of those very rare windows where you see
                    across the full range of issues, which intellectually brought me back to the
                    experience I had had in the early days with my informal tutelage under Burt
                    Marshall. Part of it was the management and human relations challenges the job
                    posed, for which I was not at all prepared and sometimes had to learn the hard
                    way as I went along.</p>
                <p>Most important, was my exposure to Bill Tyler as a role model. He thought about
                    issues with sober realism, informed by unusual understanding of the societies we
                    were dealing with, and expressed his conclusions simply, dispassionately and
                    with utmost clarity. I think he was one of the unsung giants of that age.</p>
                <p>viii.Moving on.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to him after he left EUR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Tyler went on to be Ambassador at the Hague, a pleasant consolation
                    prize, and subsequently spent a number of happy years as Director of Dumbarton
                    Oaks' Research Center in Washington. He and his wife, a great-niece of Napoleon
                    III, finally retired to their vineyards in Burgundy, of whose history and wines
                    he was a recognized expert, and where he was ultimately at home. We exchanged
                    handwritten Christmas notes for years. [It was only in the course of editing
                    this text that I learned that Bill Tyler had died, not in France, as I had
                    presumed, but in Bristol, Vermont in November 1993, not more than 20 miles from
                    where we lived in Middlebury - presumably while visiting his granddaughter Gioia
                    Thompson, an Environmentalist at the University of Vermont. I assume the Vermont
                    connection came about because he is a descendent of Royall Tyler, who once
                    courted Abigail (Nabby) Adams, helped suppress Shay's rebellion, became a famous
                    lawyer, teacher and dramatist and was, in 1801, appointed to the Vermont supreme
                    Court.]</p>
                <p>I, myself, was also provided for. Since Leddy clearly wanted his own staff, Mr.
                    Tyler arranged for me to be transferred to Berlin, an assignment I appreciated
                    but had not sought.</p>
                <p>Part V: Berlin and Bonn</p>
                <p>1. Defending Berlin</p>
                <p>a. Supervisory Political Officer</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Mr. Tyler arranged for you to go to Berlin. What was
                        your new capacity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The assignment read 'Supervisory Political Officer', which meant, as I
                    had been told in Washington, that I was to be the Deputy Chief of the Political
                    Section at the US Mission in Berlin - a nice step forward which turned out to be
                    a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How so?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>JAEGER: It became clear, when I arrived in Berlin, that this 'top-down'
                    assignment, in which EUR had 'parachuted' me into the No. 2 job in the Political
                    Section, had caused resentment in the Mission and, Assistant Secretary Tyler
                    having left EUR, was simply not going to be honored. So I was made
                    Political-Military officer in the Political Section instead, responsible for the
                    Berlin Wall and the Access Routes to Berlin - a clearly demanding job, but
                    which, as was made clear to me, involved no supervisory responsibilities. I
                    think their difficulty was that having me serve as Deputy to Jim Carson, the
                    recently arrived Political Counselor, would have implied putting me above
                    Brandon Grove, a formidable, well-connected officer, who had been Assistant to
                    Under Secretaries Chester Bowles and to George Ball, who followed events in City
                    Hall where Willy Brandt was officiating.</p>
                <p>In spite of my tacit acquiescence to this change in my assignment, I never
                    escaped the sense that I was seen as an interloper, a feeling compounded by the
                    fact that Carson and I got off to an awkward start personally which did not
                    improve over time.</p>
                <p>b. The US Mission in Berlin</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's not a great way to start a new job. Before we
                        get into that, let's first set the stage a bit: Tell us about the US Mission
                        in Berlin, how it was organized, and what it was supposed to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The U.S. Mission was America's headquarters and representation in the US
                    Sector of Berlin, established under the quadripartite arrangements worked out
                    after the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it under the authority of the American Embassy in
                        Bonn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes and no. The head of the U.S. Mission was always an American General
                    with his own line of command, in charge of the Berlin Brigade and responsible
                    for all military aspects of the Berlin operation; whereas the Deputy Chief of
                    Mission was a senior Foreign Service Officer, who took care of Berlin's
                    political and economic policy issues and reported both to the Embassy in Bonn
                    and the State Department. It was, and by necessity, had to be a harmonious
                    arrangement, in which good personal relations across complex organizational
                    lines were essential if we were to handle Berlin's Byzantine issues and frequent
                    crises effectively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the key Foreign Service people at the Mission
                        when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>JAEGER: The Deputy Chief of Mission was an American Minister, John Calhoun, a
                    stylish, competent bachelor, who got on well with the military and had
                    everyone's respect. His passion was music, which he indulged on free evenings at
                    the 'Philharmonie', Berlin's brilliantly cantilevered post-war concert hall
                    where Herbert von Karajan presided. His Deputy, Arthur Day, was a bright,
                    tightly organized officer, who kept the Mission running on all cylinders - a
                    major challenge even when Berlin was not in crisis-mode, which, as often as not,
                    it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Besides the Political Section, were there other staffs in
                        the Mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Most, importantly, the Eastern Affairs Section, a separate
                    political/economic unit which followed developments in the Soviet Sector of the
                    city. It was headed by Frank Meehan, an experienced Eastern European hand, and
                    included several bright staff members like Bill Woessner, whose wry sense of
                    humor often made the harsh drabness of the East German world they focused on a
                    bit less depressing. Even though they were limited, as far as I know, to
                    published sources and had no human contacts on the other side, they often did
                    remarkably interesting work teasing out shifts in GDR policy from the dense and
                    dull pages of “Neues Deutschland' and other official output.</p>
                <p>There were also an Economic Section, which followed Berlin's then somewhat
                    precarious economic health; a consular section; a very active Public Affairs
                    staff, including my friend, the then Press Officer John Brogan, and a Legal
                    Advisor.</p>
                <p>As for the less visible parts of the Mission, CIA's famous Berlin station, I can
                    only say that I had no working relationship with them, and had only a general
                    idea where their office was located. We did, of course, get some of the
                    intelligence output, although probably only a fraction of what was produced.</p>
                <p>c. Managing the wall and access routes</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you show us how all this machinery worked through the
                        perspective of your own experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: As I said earlier, my job was to stay on top of all issues and incidents
                    involving our access routes to Berlin, as well as the incidents which
                    continuously happened at the 'Wall'. As a result a great deal of my work was
                    conducted at night. A duty officer might call, let's say at 2:30 in the morning,
                    and report that some poor guy had tried to flee across the wall in our Sector,
                    had been shot, and that there was a big flap in the area, police, klieg-lights,
                    potential tension.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>The first step was usually to inform the British and the French on the
                    inter-Berlin network, the mechanism through which the three Western occupying
                    powers kept each other up-to-date and through which we coordinated joint
                    positions on an almost real-time basis. I would, at the same time, attempt to
                    rouse somebody on the Soviet</p>
                <p>side and take whatever action within our own system was needed to assure
                    coordination on the ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You worked with the Soviets rather than with the East
                        Germans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, but it was a continual battle since, every time one asked for the
                    Soviet duty officer, or any Soviet military officer, one invariably got an East
                    German major or colonel. Their idea was to undermine the Western position that
                    Berlin's quadripartite administration, established in post-war agreements,
                    applied to the Soviet sector of Berlin as well as ours and that the Soviets, and
                    not their East German puppet regime, were responsible for what happened there.
                    This was just one of many fronts on which constant effort was required to
                    preserve the Berlin agreements and all that flowed from them, making for a
                    complex, precedent-based and legalistic relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Must have gotten quite frustrating at times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Of course. The way it played out in practice, I would usually have to
                    waste a great deal of time telling the East German on the other end of the line,
                    that I was only authorized to speak to Soviet officers, and that it was very
                    important I do so promptly if we were to avoid escalation of the issue, et
                    cetera, et cetera. Sometimes the Soviet duty officer would consent to talk to
                    me, listen to our report of what happened and accept our protest. But those were
                    the exceptions. Usually they would simply not respond.</p>
                <p>Once I got to the office in the morning, the formal paperwork would follow, more
                    detailed inter-Berlin reports were transmitted of what had happened, and draft
                    texts of protests were coordinated. When issues were more complex or important
                    they would be put on the agenda of our frequent tripartite meetings with the
                    British and the French before being presented to the Soviets in writing or at
                    infrequent quadripartite meetings.</p>
                <p>So, to sum up and get back to your earlier question, the Mission was not only our
                    headquarters in the American Sector but an intrinsic part of the tripartite
                    system which dealt with the problems created by the GDR and their Soviet
                    overseers and, in a congenial and usually light-handed, way supervised the
                    Berlin government in City Hall.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work on air access to Berlin. There were still
                        occasional problems there during your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Actually air and rail access produced only very occasional problems. Most
                    of my time was taken up by incidents on the Helmstadt Autobahn over which, under
                    the post-war agreements, we had the right to transit the GDR with military
                    convoys.</p>
                <p>There were, of course, all kinds of incidents, retrieving broken-down military
                    vehicles, getting military personnel released who had been arrested by the East
                    Germans for some usually trumped-up offense, dealing with medical emergencies
                    which would arise, etc. We were helped in all this by the fact that we had a
                    fairly reliable call-in system enabling us to know where at any time a train or
                    convoy was located.</p>
                <p>d. What's a 'convoy'?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the most difficult problem of this sort you ever
                        faced?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Believe it or not, the pesky issue of what constituted a 'convoy'. Over
                    time a certain modus vivendi had developed under the quadripartite agreements on
                    access, and western military convoys, the life-line for the American, British
                    and French Brigades and all our other operations, traveled to Berlin routinely
                    on the designated Autobahns. There were, of course, frequent 'incidents', as I
                    have said, to harass us and keep us aware that we could be cut off at any time.
                    Even so, when I arrived, convoys moved fairly reliably in both directions.</p>
                <p>We then began to have trouble with what came to be known as 'small convoys',
                    usually convoys of three or four jeeps. After being permitted to start down the
                    Autobahn, they would be stopped somewhere and detained, forcing us into urgent
                    efforts to get them released. It gradually became clear that the Soviets agreed
                    that a 'convoy' might involve twenty trucks, but drew the line at anything as
                    small as three or four jeeps - a clearly theological distinction intended to
                    irritate and assert their local dominance.</p>
                <p>I spent an absolutely enormous amount of time on this. Every few days I would be
                    awakened in the middle of the night by a military message saying that a small
                    convoy of, say, four jeeps and a command car had been stopped on the autobahn
                    somewhere in East Germany, that the East Germans would not let them continue,
                    and could I please get them unstuck? Sometimes it sufficed to raise hell on the
                    telephone with the other side, sometimes it had to be escalated to the highest
                    levels in Berlin, and sometimes the issue had to be taken to Washington. At the
                    same time we engaged the Soviets in negotiations aimed at getting them to agree
                    that even four jeeps constituted a 'convoy'. After months of back and forth we
                    finally worked it out, and I think I can lay claim to having done it. But it was
                    a long, hard slog.</p>

                    Grove and others riding through a raised barrier on four jeeps, waving and
                    saluting - while I modestly accept their accolades with my broken lance.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: There are two others that are worth mentioning. The first came to be
                    called “the Battle of Steglitz Station House, “ a typical cold war story which
                    involved some important lessons for policy makers, and succeeded in averting a
                    major crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well that sounds meaty. Tell us about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: West Berlin had for some time been building a circumferential highway to
                    link the three western sectors of the city; since, as a result of Berlin's
                    gradual economic recovery, it had become increasingly time-consuming to drive
                    through the existing, often narrow streets, let's say, from the French sector in
                    the West via the British Sector in the middle, to the American Sector on the
                    south- eastern part of Berlin. As far as we were aware, work had been
                    progressing without a hitch, and long sections of the new elevated
                    circumferential could be seen awaiting final connection.</p>
                <p>Then, one day, word came from City Hall, that they needed to meet with us to
                    discuss a major problem. It turned out that West Berlin officials had known for
                    several years that the circumferential, as designed, would have to cross the
                    East German-owned 'S-Bahn' at Steglitz - a borough in the south-eastern part of
                    West Berlin - and that it would have to pass directly over the Steglitz Station
                    building, which, and there was the problem, was owned by the East Germans.</p>
                <p>Why this was so, involves another bit of Berlin lore: In brief, although the
                    U-Bahn was clearly an East-German rail system, it made a big loop from East
                    Berlin into West Berlin and back and, while passing across the three Western
                    sectors, carried a large amount of local traffic. It had therefore been agreed
                    years earlier, that the GDR would continue to operate this vital West Berlin
                    segment and, besides being well paid for this service, would retain full
                    ownership of all of the S-Bahn's rail and equipment, even though located in the
                    Western Sectors.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How had the Berlin officials hoped to get around this
                        obstacle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: They told us sheepishly, that they had been in telex correspondence with
                    the S-Bahn's officials for years, had offered them millions of Deutschmarks and
                    all sorts of other goodies if they would allow them to move the Steglitz station
                    house out of the way of the circumferential, but had been consistently brushed
                    off. Now, things had reached the crisis point. The circumferential was within 50
                    yards on both sides of Steglitz station house, and the whole project had had to
                    be stopped pending resolution of this question.</p>
                <p>The good news was that the Berlin press had so far not yet twigged on this. But
                    the Berlin officials were desperately afraid that they would, any moment,
                    publish pictures of the two ends of the circumferential looming ridiculously
                    over the gap occupied by the Steglitz Station and that Berlin's City Hall would
                    have no credible explanation as to how or when this issue would be resolved.
                    Even worse, the East Germans might never agree to let West Berlin close the
                    Steglitz gap. The result, would not only be the loss of hundreds of millions of
                    dollars for this high-visibility project, but a huge political fiasco for the
                    Berlin Senat (the City Hall administration).</p>
                <p>Clearly, Berlin's City Hall had been very foolish not to come to us much
                    earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quite a mess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: And it landed squarely on my desk. As things stood, it seemed obvious
                    that more appeasement wouldn't work: The GDR didn't care about the money, but
                    were stonewalling to make the West lose face. There was therefore only one way
                    to deal with this, to show the East that we meant business.</p>
                <p>I drafted a simple action plan, whose first step was a telex to the GDR Railway
                    Administration presenting them with an ultimatum: If they agreed within 24 hours
                    to our moving the Steglitz Station house the previous financial offers would be
                    honored. If not, the Allied powers would simply remove it. To my delight and
                    surprise, my telegram was cleared without a hitch and quickly approved in
                    Washington, even though everyone understood that our ultimatum could precipitate
                    another major Berlin crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who had to approve this sort of message?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Besides my boss, the American Minister Mr. Calhoun, as well as the Berlin
                    Commandant. In Washington, State, Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
                    probably the White House. Locally the plan was also coordinated with our Embassy
                    in Bonn, as well as the British and the French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: So the agreed strategy was: Let them know that they were now dealing with
                    the Western Allies; give them one more chance to resolve things amicably; insist
                    on a prompt, constructive reply; and, make it crystal clear that if we don't
                    receive one by the stipulated time, we would move in unilaterally and simply
                    take down the Steglitz station house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did it play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, it was a big show. On the appointed night American troops, as well
                    as some British and French elements, were quietly deployed in the misty gloom of
                    side streets, together with all sorts of heavy equipment, while Steglitz Station
                    house was starkly illuminated and set off against the drizzly dark by glaring
                    arc lights. All the tripartite brass was there, as well as the senior diplomatic
                    people. Tension was running fairly high, since our telex had been sent to the
                    GDR the evening before and, as expected, there had so far been no reply. The
                    action - appropriately nicknamed “Nacht und Nebel Aktion” (Night and Fog Action)
                    - was to begin at ten o'clock.</p>
                <p>But just before ten there was a crisis. For just as the wrecking ball was about
                    to swing into action, someone discovered that moving the complicated railway
                    clock, which regulated U-Bahn traffic, across the track to the temporary
                    platform we were constructing on the other side, was more challenging than the
                    West Berlin railway techies had expected and, if mismanaged, would disrupt the
                    whole system. As it turned out one them knew the man in East Berlin who was the
                    S-Bahn's expert on railway clocks. In a rather desperate 'Hail Mary' play, he
                    called him on the S-Bahn's own service phone and told him, I thought quite
                    implausibly, that he was making some repairs and asked if he could help!</p>
                <p>To our huge relief, the East German bought the story and dutifully talked him
                    through the process of disconnecting and reconnecting the clock; helping us
                    avoid a huge public mess, since S-Bahn traffic through West Berlin needed to
                    resume normally at 6 AM the next day. As it was, the big wrecking ball went into
                    action only an hour or so later and, in short order, knocked down the station
                    house.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>Then it was a matter of waiting to see how the East Germans would react. It was
                    not till a bit after midnight that an S-Bahn train arrived at top speed and
                    screeched to a stop. Its only passenger was an East German General in full
                    uniform. He got out, looked at the remains of the station house with obvious
                    amazement and said, “What in hell are you people doing?”</p>
                <p>Our senior people told him. The West had sent them endless messages. They had
                    ignored them. They had been given an ultimatum, and had ignored that. We then
                    went ahead, as we said we would.</p>
                <p>The General, still looking bewildered, simply said, “Well, we were all wrong!
                    None of us thought you'd have the guts to do this!” He then got back on his
                    train and left. The next morning, the S-Bahn ran on schedule, as of nothing had
                    happened!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that was quite a success, and must have shaken them
                        up on the other side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It did indeed. We learned through intelligence channels some months
                    later, that there had been a major purge in the East German Railway
                    Administration, as well as in some of their intelligence organizations. The
                    bottom line was that they had assumed the West would chicken out and that they
                    could win a propaganda victory by hanging tough. Instead we won.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There some lessons to be drawn from this, no?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I have always thought so - and still have a small piece of one of the
                    bricks from Steglitz station house on my desk in Vermont as a reminder that
                    competent diplomacy sometimes does have to resort to force, but only when the
                    cause is just, the game plan has been carefully thought through and one has done
                    everything reasonably possible to avoid it.</p>
                <p>f. Check Point Charlie: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned there was another major issue which arose
                        during you time in Berlin. What was that about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>JAEGER: This was about access by US diplomatic personnel to East Berlin. Since
                    the West was trying to maintain the principle that Berlin was under
                    quadripartite rule, the three Western allies asserted their right to be and to
                    be seen in the Soviet Sector of Berlin, even after the Wall had gone up. Simply
                    put we had a monthly schedule, under which our diplomatic people would be
                    assigned to go to East Berlin to spend a few high-visibility hours having lunch
                    or dinner, going to the opera, the Brecht theater, concerts, or museums. The
                    idea was to get the word around in that drab, sealed-off, police-ridden
                    Communist world that we were still there and would not go away.</p>
                <p>I myself went over many times and often found these visits richly rewarding. I
                    particularly remember one evening, when three or four of us went to have dinner
                    at the Writers Club in East Berlin, where a little band usually played. As we
                    came into the room the music stopped, and they began playing the theme song of
                    the 'Bridge on the River Kwai', as we were being shown to our seats! The
                    yearning for freedom was palpable. It was deeply moving.</p>
                <p>A similar thing happened when my fianc�, Pat Clark and I went across to East
                    Berlin toward the end of my tour. Among other things we went to the famous
                    Berlin Zoo. When we came out we found a bouquet of fresh flowers on the
                    windshield of my Volkswagen, which, of course had diplomatic license plates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those were still grim times. But, how did your problem
                        arise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: My boss, Jim Carson, thought it was important to rationalize some of the
                    crusty and illogical Berlin procedures which had developed over time. One day
                    the proposal surfaced, with his strong support, that instead of the prevailing
                    system of showing identity cards as members of the U.S. Military Mission when we
                    passed Checkpoint Charlie on trips to East Berlin, which had worked reliably, we
                    should make clear who we are and produce new diplomatic identity cards,
                    equivalent to diplomatic passports.</p>
                <p>I thought from the outset that this was just asking for trouble. Since I was the
                    political-military officer responsible for wall issues, and so directly
                    involved, I argued in staff meetings that we were just offering the Soviets a
                    pretext to cause difficulties. If something works, why fix it, particularly
                    since this proposal would reopen basic questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wouldn't using diplomatic ID, or passports, have implied
                        recognition of the Soviet Sector as part of an independent state? The
                        quadripartite administration of Berlin was a military arrangement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: You have gone right to the heart of the matter. The thing was fraught
                    with problems if the Soviets chose to make use of them.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>So I argued against this project at length over a period of weeks, pointing out
                    that we didn't need to create new Berlin crises where there weren't any and
                    should just go on using the military ID cards to go to East Berlin as we had
                    done for years.</p>
                <p>Well, the Mission's decision went against me and the project was approved in
                    Washington. New ID cards were printed identifying us as diplomatic officers, and
                    messages were sent to the Soviets that we would henceforth be using these new
                    IDs at Checkpoint Charlie. Since the Soviets did not promptly reply, Carson
                    decided we should have a series of 'probes'. The first went fine. Our guy went
                    to Checkpoint Charlie, was waved through and came back. No problem. Then six,
                    eight, ten more people were sent to East Berlin with the new ID's, and all still
                    went well. So one day, Carson came into my office dropped my new ID on my desk
                    and said rather sarcastically, “Well, everybody else has got through OK. It
                    should be safe enough now for you.”</p>
                <p>So I took my new diplomatic ID card, and drove to Check Point Charlie, where, it
                    was instantly obvious, there was unusual activity. There were film cameras,
                    people on roof tops, and more uniformed people than usual on the ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had reached a decision.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. I nevertheless drove into the slot at Checkpoint Charlie, handed the
                    guard my new ID card and was immediately told it was no good: “We only accept
                    military cards. What's this?” I did my best to explain that I was a diplomatic
                    member of the American Military Mission, and that this was my new diplomatic
                    identity card, about which the Soviets had been informed. He said, “Not
                    acceptable! Turn around and go back to where you came from!”</p>
                <p>Our standard rule was that if we encountered a problem at the checkpoint, we
                    would stay put as long as reasonable so as not to look as if we were turning
                    tail. So I simply said, “No, I am entitled to go through!” and blocked
                    Checkpoint Charlie by sitting in the slot for about twenty minutes - creating a
                    major fuss.</p>
                <p>Eventually somebody from the Western side came running over to me and said, “OK.
                    You have made your point. The Mission wants you to turn around and come
                    back.”</p>
                <p>When I walked into the Mission, there was a deathly silence in my section. The
                    next morning a message came from Washington saying that the diplomatic ID
                    experiment had clearly not worked and that we should go back to using our
                    military cards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the Soviets just took a while to react. And you were
                        proven right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, but it was a pyrrhic victory. Carson's embarrassment came on top of
                    several other unfortunate encounters - the worst of which occurred when I was
                    the duty officer during a Command Post Exercise simulating an attack on our
                    access routes and needed to have him come in. When reached at home, he was too
                    inebriated to respond. None of this endeared me to him or helped my efficiency
                    reports, which had a pretty negative undertone and suggested that I had a lot to
                    learn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that hurt your career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Not seriously, although it did delay my next promotion. Luckily, I must
                    have developed a better reputation at the Embassy, since in early January 1967 I
                    got a message from Martin Hillenbrand, the Deputy Chief of Mission, saying that
                    he'd like me to come to Bonn to work on our negotiations with Germany on the
                    Non-Proliferation Treaty and the FRG's relations with Eastern Europe and the
                    Soviet Union! This was a wonderful break, which opened a whole new future.</p>
                <p>g. The Brandt years in Berlin</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's a happy ending. Before we go on to Bonn can
                        we round out the Berlin story with a bit of atmospherics. What were the
                        Brandt years like, and how was you personal life there in what was clearly a
                        difficult assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Berlin, even in the sixties was an exciting city, for all kinds of the
                    reasons: There was the Berliners' sharp, aggressive humor, their “Schnauze”, or
                    'big mouth', which kept up spirits even in the glummest times; their conviction
                    that, even though the West Berlin economy was limping, and much of the place was
                    still grey and run down, they were holding their own; and that the troubles on
                    our Western side were as nothing compared to the misery of the fear-ridden
                    regimented people in East Berlin and in the GDR. There was West Berlin's lively
                    cultural scene, its bustling cabarets, excellent theater, and above all Herbert
                    von Karajan's magisterial concerts at the Philharmonie, Berlin's new
                    cantilevered concert hall. Last, but not least, there was the political presence
                    of Willy Brandt, Berlin's extraordinary mayor during the first part of my
                    tour.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>Together with his long-time advisor, and Berlin Press Secretary, Egon Bahr,
                    Brandt had cautiously pointed the way to a less confrontational future, with his
                    slogan of 'Wandel durch Ann�herung', or 'change through rapprochement'. Its
                    central theses were first presented in Egon Bahr's famous speech before the
                    Tutzing Academy, rejecting the 'Hallstein Doctrine', which had argued that only
                    pressure and isolation would bring the East German state to collapse. Instead,
                    Brandt, who was both Berlin mayor until 1966 and head of the SPD, and Bahr
                    called for a policy of 'little steps' to induce change in East Germany through
                    detente as a way station to his new concept of two German states in one nation.
                    When he became Foreign Minister in Kiesinger's Grand Coalition in 1966 he was
                    better able to advance these views, but had to remain restrained, given the
                    CDU's and most of the Allies' Cold War thinking. Eventually, however, Brandt
                    prevailed and provided the basis, once he was Chancellor, for the 1971 Four
                    Power Agreement on Berlin, and the Basic Treaty signed by the two Germanys in
                    1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Brandt's views affect work at the US Mission while
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Actually not a lot. As Mayor Brandt had succeeded in arranging for a
                    limited number of passes, enabling divided families to see each other
                    occasionally. And Brandt, or Bahr made occasional forward-looking statements
                    outlining their views. But, in the main, things were still frozen in solid Cold
                    War confrontation. Brandon Grove, who did the liaising at City Hall, worked
                    mostly with Brandt's aide Stoltenberg. The issues he reported on were usually
                    technical and rarely fundamental. In fact few, on our side foresaw the enormous
                    role Brandt's 'Ostpolitik” would soon play in changing the whole east-west
                    equation.</p>
                <p>h. Surviving Berlin</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did you fare personally in all this? Were there
                        any bright spots?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Of course. I spent wonderful evenings listening to Karajan, enjoyed
                    exploring Berlin, both east and west, gave talks to groups of students at the
                    Freie Universit�t, the Free University, which was already stressed by the
                    sometimes violently rebellious attitudes of the sixties, and learned a great
                    deal about the whole range of German issues.</p>
                <p>Even so, Berlin was a confining experience. And the relentless killing and
                    maiming on the wall, and the continuing pressures on our access routes,
                    sometimes got to me. I particularly remember one winter evening when things had
                    not been going well. The somber pine tree outside my apartment window, dripping
                    with cold rain, seemed to embody the essence of the darkness we were all caught
                    up in.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>I did the smart thing, and went to see whom I might phone to cheer me up. In
                    paging through my little black book, Pat Clark jumped out, the lovely, bright
                    blond girl I had met briefly on Mykonos on a leave after my tour in Zagreb. We
                    had only had a coffee together, in the bright morning sunlight of that enchanted
                    island - not yet destroyed by cruise ships and mass tourism. But she had come to
                    see my ship off that evening when I had to go back to Athens, and I still
                    remember her standing on the dock and waving as we steamed off into the Aegean
                    sunset!</p>
                <p>So I phoned Pat in Brussels, where she was working, and asked if she would like
                    to have dinner the next night, a Saturday. She seemed delighted, as was I. So I
                    got on the US troop train which rattled across the GDR that night, went on to
                    Brussels and found Pat unchanged, just as I had remembered.</p>
                <p>We celebrated at a glorious dinner at 'Comme Chez Soi', the three star
                    restaurant, which Churchill, Monet and many others had thought the best in
                    Europe. As the kind, old, red-nosed waiter brought second and third helpings of
                    'mousse de becasse' through the narrow swinging doors of the venerable
                    restaurant, with its green leather banquettes facing each other in a space not
                    much wider than a diner, and we drank the first of what, over the years, would
                    be many bottles of 'Domaine du Chevalier '55', Berlin fell away from me, and I
                    new that I had finally come home.</p>
                <p>2. NPT and Ostpolitik in Bonn</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Knowing both of you, that was a wonderful outcome. Now,
                        let's shift gears and go on to your new assignment at the Embassy in Bonn.
                        What was the situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>a. Bonn and Plittersdorf</p>
                <p>JAEGER: Coming to Bonn in February 1967 was an exhilarating experience. I had not
                    fully realized to what extent our insular Berlin life, surrounded by hostility
                    and oppression, had colored my life until I took my first meander along the tree
                    lined banks of the Rhine, which flowed by our vast barracks-like Embassy
                    building, and began exploring Bonn, Cologne and the lovely surrounding villages
                    and towns. Although Berlin had been sharp-edged, lively and cultured, there was
                    a mellow depth about the Rhineland, for all its provincialism, which was deeply
                    therapeutic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did one live at the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Living arrangements, were simple. Everybody lived in the Plittersdorf
                    housing area on the outskirts of Bonn not far from the Embassy. Essentially it
                    was a “Little America” in a sea of Germans, a collection of two story
                    military-type apartment buildings, with an officers' club, a PX, a school, a
                    movie and all the other usual American amenities - all overlooking the Rhine
                    river which flowed by below.</p>
                <p>Apartments were assigned on a rank basis, just like in the Army. If you got a
                    promotion you got a better apartment. It was all very convenient but tended to
                    keep many of the Americans rather insulated from German life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was not just the American military, but the whole
                        embassy staff who lived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. The administrative office simply assigned you. I remember I
                    got a rather nice, large apartment with a pleasant enough view. Even so, life in
                    Plittersdorf was a bit like living on an Army base, and was not a great place to
                    entertain one's German friends and contacts, who always felt as if they were
                    going to a foreign country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during your whole tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Funny you should ask that. When Henry Cabot Lodge arrived as Ambassador
                    in Bonn in May of 1968, succeeding George McGhee, who was the Ambassador when I
                    arrived, he took one look at Plittersdorf and said, “I want my senior officers
                    out of here!” He realized instantly that, for all its convenience, Plittersdorf
                    segregated us into a self-imposed American ghetto. Perhaps because he was an
                    unrepentant aristocrat, and had clear ideas how diplomats should live to be
                    effective, Lodge hated that whole scene.</p>
                <p>Our admin people, who were appalled by this threatened revolution, hoped Lodge
                    wouldn't be able get money to rent houses. But, a few months later, he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have stirred things up!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Indeed. The word went out from the front office that all First
                    Secretaries and up were invited to leave Plittersdorf, and could now set
                    themselves up in nice new rented houses in the Bonn community. This didn't
                    affect me since I was then still a Second Secretary. But, when push came to
                    shove, nobody wanted to go. Absolutely nobody wanted to go! There were all sorts
                    of excuses, children in school, health reasons, you name it. The truth was that
                    the main street in Plittersdorf, where all the seniors had their apartments, was
                    a wonderful vantage point for socializing, networking, and knowing what your
                    colleagues and their wives were up to!</p>

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: So one day Tom Stern, the Admin. Counselor called me in and said,
                    “George, I'm in deep trouble. Lodge got his money, and none of the senior people
                    want to move out of Plittersdorf. All their wives say they want to stay there
                    and be near the officers' club and the swimming pool. You're a bachelor. Would
                    you go?” I said, “Of course I'll go!”</p>
                <p>So for the second half of my tour, I ended up with an absolutely gorgeous villa
                    on a wooded hillside above Bonn, on a posh street called 'Am Stadtwald', with
                    all kinds of bedrooms, balconies, servants quarters, gardens and views. My
                    neighbors were some of the FRG's senior politicians and other eminences from the
                    University and elsewhere. I installed myself there with Ivanka, my housekeeper
                    from Zagreb, whom I had brought along. All this was particularly fortuitous,
                    because Pat and I were married in January 1970 and we were able to start our new
                    life together in this ideal setting. I and the few others who had abandoned
                    Plittersdorf ended up being the envy of the Embassy.</p>
                <p>b. The cast of characters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like an ideal place. You mentioned Henry Cabot
                        Lodge. Why don't we talk a bit about him and the several other Ambassadors
                        you worked for, as well as some of the other senior people at the
                        Embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: My first Ambassador, after I was assigned early in 1967 as Second
                    Secretary in the Political Section was, as I said, George McGhee - originally an
                    oil man, who had been Director of Policy Planning and Under Secretary of State
                    for Political Affairs before President Johnson sent him to Germany in 1963. He
                    was a Henry the Eighth type, florid, full-chested, self-confident and hard
                    charging, liked action and good food, and was clearly in his element in Bonn. I
                    certainly was in awe of him, and liked and respected him. I still have some
                    notes he sent me, saying that he particularly liked this and that telegram.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you sketch in the context?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Although he looked and acted the part of a pro-consul, McGhee actually
                    presided over a certain loosening of relations between the US and the FRG, after
                    Erhard's right-center coalition was replaced by the Grand Coalition between the
                    CDU and the SPD in 1966, and Willy Brandt became Vice Chancellor and Foreign
                    Minister. There were sharp disagreements over a range of issues, particularly
                    German off-set payments for American troops and equipment stationed in Germany
                    (increasingly divisive because of our growing problems in Vietnam), non
                    proliferation and Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik which Washington initially found
                    threatening, but which McGhee personally rather welcomed as a much-needed breath
                    of fresh air.</p>
                <p>Of the three Ambassadors I served under, I think McGhee certainly cared most
                    deeply about Germany, and maintained close and cordial relations, first with
                    Chancellor Erhard, and, in my time, with Kiesinger and Brandt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was his DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: First, Martin Hillenbrand, then Russ Fessenden. They were both wonderful
                    people. I had admired Hillenbrand ever since, as a graduate student at Harvard,
                    I had come across a published version of his doctoral thesis at Columbia on
                    'Power and Morals' - since I too had always been concerned over the relation of
                    our ethical and moral traditions to the management of power. Unfortunately he
                    left shortly after my arrival to become our first Ambassador to Hungary - we had
                    only had Ministers there before. He was succeeded by Russell Fessenden, a less
                    formal, kind and very thoughtful man, with a wry sense of humor, who was
                    wonderful to work for. Of the two, Russ was the more approachable, less
                    hierarchical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did DCM's actually run this huge Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: They didn't micromanage, but oversaw and gave direction on the major
                    policy and administrative issues. Bonn had an extraordinarily gifted staff at
                    that time, which was like a very good orchestra. We picked up very fast when the
                    conductor wanted, let's say, a little more adagio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter. Who were the other major players?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The Political Counselor Jim Sutterlin, a cultivated, deft, literate and
                    gifted diplomat, who later had a long and distinguished second career at the UN.
                    He was succeeded by Jonathan Dean in August '68, a brilliant, bigger-than-life
                    workaholic who had vast experience in Germany and with European issues. My
                    immediate superiors, were Jack Shaw, an experienced, thoughtful
                    Eastern-Europeanist who unfortunately died only a few years later; followed by
                    bright, articulate, manipulative Gerry Livingston; and finally Jock Dean
                    himself.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who else stands out in your recollections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It was a cast of extraordinary characters. There was Nelson Ledsky,
                    Bonn's Berlin man, a loud, flabby take-no-prisoners type, straight out of
                    central New York casting, who in spite of his abrasiveness, had everyone's
                    respect for his huge productivity, consistent competence and hard work; Phil
                    Wolfson, who philosophically followed German domestic politics; and Hans von
                    Imhof, a hugely overweight former Viennese Baron of the Imhof banking family -
                    wise, shrewd and consistently pessimistic - who became a good personal
                    friend.</p>
                <p>Besides being the Embassy's acknowledged sage, Hans was the Embassy's link to
                    Herbert Wehner - the tough former member of the German Communist party's Central
                    Committee, who had gone to Moscow in 1933, survived Stalin's purges (some say by
                    denouncing other Germans) left the Communist Party while imprisoned for
                    espionage in wartime Sweden, and then, after the war, became a leading light in
                    West Germany' Social Democratic Party, the SPD and. as such, critically
                    important to Willy Brandt's election as Chancellor. Wehner was the SPD's leader
                    in parliament in my time in Bonn, didn't suffer fools gladly and made it clear
                    that he only wanted to deal with Imhof at the Embassy.</p>
                <p>Sadly, Hans died soon after he returned to the States following his Bonn
                    assignment, perhaps from depression or the effects of his passion for genuinely
                    great cuisine. I found him anxiously waiting for me one day, when I returned
                    from a world class lunch at the French Ambassador's residence, where some
                    important current issues were discussed, with only one question: “What was on
                    the menu?”.</p>
                <p>There were others. Dennis Kux, bright and capable but, I thought, rather too
                    flexible on issues; my always clear-thinking and perceptive classmate and friend
                    Tom Hirschfeld; and Herma Plummer - the elderly Margaret Rutherford-like
                    graduate of the N�rnberg trials and Allan Dulles' World War II operation in
                    Geneva - who liked me because I too sometimes swam against the tide. That, as
                    she never tired of explaining, was also her main role as Deputy in Ray Cline's
                    huge Bonn station - to shoot down enthusiasts and ill-founded projects which she
                    said popped up relentlessly, like daisies.</p>
                <p>Herma, Pat and I remained in touch for years, and we even visited her after she
                    had retired in Vevey on Lake Geneva in Switzerland, still fulminating as ever
                    against our government's “stupidity”. She was mercifully spared the second Bush
                    administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There must have been many more?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, of course. I should certainly add Joachim von Elbe, the small,
                    sharp-nosed former Prussian lawyer who had been a figure on John McCloy's legal
                    staff when the latter was High Commissioner for the American Sector. Better than
                    anyone, he knew and embodied the complex legal lore of Germany's post-war
                    arrangements and so was often the key advisor in choosing just the right
                    technical argument in some east-west dispute.</p>
                <p>Although he could be mildly snippy, I was fond of Joachim, not only for his
                    courtly manners and knowledge of history, but because of his unusual avocation:
                    He was arguably the leading expert on Roman remains in Germany and even produced
                    a small, much-appreciated tourist guide to Germany's Roman sites. I once asked
                    him how he found the locations of erstwhile Roman camps. “Well, its simple”, he
                    said, “You just look for piles of oyster shells!” It seems all the Roman
                    officers had oysters brought north over the Roman road system and left the
                    indestructible shells behind! I always wondered, given the then lack of
                    refrigeration, how they could possibly have avoided getting sick!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been quite a challenge running so big an
                        operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Of course, it was a huge Embassy, with extensive military representation,
                    a large economic section, treasury attach�s, all kinds of folks doing various
                    things. When Russ Fessenden took over from Hillenbrand he ran this empire
                    efficiently but with an even lighter touch.</p>
                <p>He did, I suspect, have a difficult relationship with Jock Dean, who invariably
                    insisted on being center stage. Russ managed this with finesse and subtlety,
                    even when he himself was sometimes put in the shade - and quietly protected
                    Dean's staff who chafed under his constant pressure for quality and
                    production.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Actually a bit earlier, in May '68</p>

                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. He was there only till January '69, and used Bonn as a platform to
                    keep his hand in Vietnam. The odd thing was that although he really didn't do
                    squiddly-doo for the Germans, worked very gentlemanly hours, and did not convey
                    the intensity of leadership the times called for, he became an overnight
                    celebrity in the FRG and was lionized, I assume for his aristocratic background
                    and status in American politics. McGhee had battled hard for the Germans in
                    Washington and had cared deeply, but was seen as a sort of imperial legate and
                    so got a rather low-key goodbye when he left. Lodge, on the other hand, received
                    a hero's send-off after a very brief, I think, largely unproductive tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then, to round things off, there was Kenneth
                        Rush.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, after an interregnum of several months when Russ Fessenden was
                    charg�. Rush, a former President of Union Carbide and Nixon's one-time law
                    professor, arrived in the summer of 1969. I remember him as a nice, friendly man
                    starting on a rather steep learning curve, who didn't speak a word of German,
                    needed a lot of backstopping and had the great good sense of letting Jock Dean
                    and others show him the way on policy.</p>
                <p>Although Dean later claimed that Rush was a go-getter, I had the impression
                    during my final months in Bonn that it was really Dean who seized the lead and
                    guided Rush, first to and then through the critically important Four-Power talks
                    on Berlin in 1970; talks which later lead to the Four-Power Agreement on Berlin
                    in 1971 and the Basic Treaty of 1973, a pathbreaking process which reversed the
                    Hallstein doctrine, secured the status of and access to Berlin and led to the
                    reciprocal recognition of the GDR and the FRG. It was Jock Dean's vision, drive
                    and relentless determination - reflected in a complex and enormously
                    labor-intensive process, involving back-channel contacts with the Soviets and
                    vast numbers of detailed daily briefing papers, which guided Rush through these
                    talks, broke the German log jam and, in time, culminated in the reunification of
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>Although the Cold War would continue, these fundamental changes ultimately
                    vindicated Brandt's Ostpolitik.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those were certainly important and dramatic times. Before
                        we go on to your own work in the Political Section you must have just
                        arrived in Bonn when Lyndon Johnson came for Adenauer's funeral?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>JAEGER: It was actually my first major experience in Bonn. Ambassador McGhee had
                    been urging President Johnson to visit for some time, but nothing came of it
                    until Adenauer's Funeral, which brought the President to Bonn with a large
                    entourage from April 23-26, 1967. Although quickly arranged, there was all the
                    usual fuss with advance teams and complex arrangements. The President, it was
                    decided, would stay at the DCM's house, one of several residences beyond the
                    front ranks of the Plittersdorf apartments, because it was conveniently located,
                    had a nice view over some lawns to the Rhine, was fairly capacious, and was
                    generally bright and pleasant. Russ Fessenden and his family were, of course,
                    evicted for the duration.</p>
                <p>The advance teams then decided the house would, in effect, have to be redone.
                    First, word came down that the President didn't like to look at rows of
                    bookshelves - Russ was an avid reader with a large library - they would have to
                    be covered up with false walls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How depressing!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That was just the start. The President, we were told, also required
                    super-sized shower heads because he liked to have a very vigorous stream of
                    water when he had his shower. So it was decided that all the standard German
                    shower heads in the DCM's residence would have to be replaced! This backfired
                    disastrously, because when President Johnson first used his super-duper shower
                    head, it blew out of its setting, pipes burst and there was, to venture an
                    understatement, a national crisis</p>

                <p>JAEGER: By putting in these high-pressure White House shower heads they had
                    somehow overlooked that this might stress the whole water system in the
                    house.</p>
                <p>There was a long list of other requirements for this three-day stay, for which
                    the President's own super-sized bed had to be flown over from Washington and
                    installed with considerable difficulty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Incredible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, yes. The Embassy itself, of course, went to battle-stations,
                    involving 24-hour-a-day backstopping, including senior and various mores
                    specialized duty officers, military liaison, medics and so on. Nothing had been
                    overlooked.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>Anyway, the great day finally arrived, and we all went out to the airport in
                    Cologne, where Air Force One landed and came to a majestic halt that evening in
                    a blinding circle of klieg lights. From there Marine helicopters were to fly the
                    President, Secretary Rusk and the other members of his large party to
                    Plittersdorf and Bonn. Our job was to meet the particular member of the
                    President's party to whom we had been assigned as he or she descended from Air
                    Force One and to make sure they got safely onto the helicopter to which they had
                    been pre-assigned.</p>
                <p>I had drawn Mrs. Eleanor Dulles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, the famous sister of John Foster and Allan Dulles, who
                        played such a role in German and Austrian post-war affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, she was still a rather feared power-house in the Department and had,
                    of course, known Adenauer well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did you make out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: As you will see, not too well. I did get to Mrs. Dulles, who was the last
                    to get off Air Force One, which was rather a challenge in all the confusion of
                    helicopters landing and taking off, German and American security people, VIPs
                    and blinding lights. I was about to usher her onto, what I gathered was, the
                    last helicopter when Mrs. Dulles said to me with emphasis that she needed to go
                    to a bathroom!</p>
                <p>I guided her in the general direction of where I thought there might be some
                    bathrooms, when a security type stuck his gun in my face and told me to stop. I
                    said, “Well, this is Mrs. Dulles. She needs to go to a bathroom.” He explained
                    that he didn't give a damn who it was, his orders were that nobody was to leave
                    this perimeter! Things clearly were getting desperate. Looking around for some
                    solution, I spotted a German General in full dress uniform and red epaulets, and
                    explained to him that I had a very senior White House damsel in intense
                    distress. He clicked his heals and with impeccable courtesy personally escorted
                    Mrs. Dulles to the ladies' room and back, an arrangement which the security
                    types apparently found acceptable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Close call!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>JAEGER: It was a nightmare! For, having barely managed to solve the first part of
                    my problem, I now had to face the fact that I had no helicopter, since the bird
                    Mrs. Dulles had been assigned to had long since taken off! How on earth was I
                    going to get her to Bonn in time to catch up with the President's party? I
                    spotted a Marine Lieutenant essentially just standing there and decided to toss
                    the problem in his lap. “Lieutenant,” I said, “I need a helicopter for Mrs.
                    Dulles!”</p>
                <p>Totally unfazed he just said, “Yes, sir,” talked into his walkie-talkie and said,
                    “Come down number 12. Come down number 12. Mrs. Dulles needs to go to
                    Plittersdorf,” And out of the black sky above the klieg lights came the spare
                    helicopter! So, against all odds, Mrs. Dulles went off to Plittersdorf, and left
                    me standing there in the middle of the tarmac to find my way back as best I
                    could!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] Now that they were all there, how did the visit
                        play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Adenauer's funeral was simple, moving and memorable for the immense
                    outpouring of respect for this man who had given Germany a new sense of decent
                    identity and backbone when it most needed it. As for President Johnson's visit,
                    he used the occasion to see a number of European leaders, including, of course,
                    German President Luebke and Chancellor Kiesinger, as well as Charles de Gaulle,
                    Wilson, Aldo Moro, the Turkish Prime Minister Demirel, most of the Scandinavians
                    and a few others. He received most of these people in his quarters for
                    discussions to which none of us were privy.</p>
                <p>My only contact with President Johnson occurred on the night when I was the
                    senior duty officer for the visit. The red telephone, which only Johnson would
                    use, rang late that night in our special command post. I picked up and heard
                    this gruff, unmistakable voice saying, “Son, you fellows got any more bourbon
                    down there?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I said, “Yes, Mr. President, we certainly do!” and sent a marine sergeant
                    to take a fresh bottle to the President's residence. Perhaps it helped him
                    struggle with the devils plaguing him over Vietnam, where he had just recently
                    escalated the bombing. I think it was the next day they all went home, and life
                    gradually returned to normal.</p>
                <p>d. Eleanor Dulles</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back for a moment to Eleanor Dulles. What was her
                        position in the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>JAEGER: She had a long and distinguished history of public service in her own
                    right. In the post-war years she was the major figure in Austria's economic
                    recovery program, in effect creating Austria's ski industry from scratch - by
                    developing ski resorts like Lech am Vorarlberg and its essential access routes.
                    In 1949 she moved to the German desk, where she stayed for ten years and played
                    a similarly powerful role in the reconstruction of Berlin and the FRG. She is,
                    for instance, credited with having been the driving force behind the
                    construction of the Berlin Congress Hall, the 'Philharmonie', the Berlin Medical
                    Center and other major projects. That her brother, John Foster Dulles was
                    Secretary of State during part of this period, of course did not hurt, since she
                    reportedly never hesitated to phone him for help when she ran into bureaucratic
                    opposition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They must have loved that!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's one way of putting it! She was used to getting her way, was very
                    strong willed and often proven to have been right in the end. She became a
                    constant gadfly in the Office of German Affairs, where they never quite figured
                    out how to deal with her. She was in the system, but actually above it, because
                    of her powerful connections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contacts with her other than during
                        Adenauer's Funeral?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: She was often in Bonn, where on at least one occasion I was her 'Control
                    Officer', managing her appointments, going along if appropriate, and generally
                    making sure that she was taken care of. All that usually went without a hitch,
                    except for one evening when she had no dinner invitation. Since I didn't just
                    want to send her back to her hotel, I arranged for us to have dinner at one of
                    the nice restaurants on the banks of the Rhine. Now, this really gets
                    gossipy....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what the project wants!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Is that what the project wants?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, when we were settled at a lovely table, I asked her, “Mrs. Dulles,
                    what would you enjoy?” Rummaging in her huge carpet bag, which was her trade
                    mark, she said: “Oh, nothing at all. I brought my sandwiches!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>JAEGER: At which point things got icky. The waiter said, “Well, we don't let
                    people just sit here.” I said to the waiter, “Look, my friend, that may be the
                    case, but this is Mrs. Eleanor Dulles!” He said something unprintable in German,
                    along the lines that he didn't really care what kind of an Eleanor she was, and
                    made it even clearer that she couldn't sit there and not eat dinner in their
                    restaurant!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she know German, by the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Oh, yes, quite adequately! She simply ignored all this and started
                    unwrapping her sandwich. With the situation rapidly spinning out of control, I
                    resolved things by ordering two dinners, one of which got eaten. Eleanor seemed
                    oblivious, clearly enjoyed our evening on the Rhine, and never, then or later,
                    offered to reimburse me. I learned a bit more that evening about Calvinism and
                    self-righteousness, and was left in no doubt that she was her brother's
                    sister.</p>
                <p>e. Coaxing Germany to sign the NPT</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move on now to your own work in the Political
                        Section in Bonn during this complex and rather historic period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Marty Hillenbrand had brought me down from Berlin to take on the
                    increasing workload generated by the then ongoing negotiations over German
                    adhesion to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and to help cover Ostpolitik, Germany's
                    rapidly evolving relationship with Eastern Europe and the USSR, which had become
                    an issue of prime interest since Brandt became Foreign Minister in the Grand
                    Coalition and then Chancellor. The evolution of Ostpolitik was slow and
                    incremental, so had to be discovered, since good parts of the process remained
                    obscured in secrecy.</p>
                <p>Later, I was also asked to follow the FDP (the Freie Deutsche Partei), a small
                    right-of-center party critical to the balance of political power in German
                    coalitions, a much more straight-forward task.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's focus first on the non-proliferation work. What
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Right. The notion of limiting nuclear proliferation goes back to the
                    earliest years of the nuclear age, when Bernard Baruch warned the world of the
                    risks of spreading nuclear arsenals. Driven by the dual impeti of peaceful uses
                    of atomic energy and weapons development, the nuclear age took off, if one may
                    put it that way, with a bang.</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>By 1958 the CIA estimated that there were 16 potential nuclear weapons states, a
                    number which threatened to expand further. Moreover, both the US and the USSR
                    were supplying their forces with vast numbers of nuclear weapons, some of which
                    were farmed out to allied states. Although various test-ban and other arms
                    control initiatives were launched, not much happened until the Cuba missile
                    crisis put the dangers of an anarchic nuclear world in blindingly clear
                    perspective. It was as a result, that Kennedy pushed hard for a global
                    non-proliferation regime, and in effect put it over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the FRG react?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Although this is not well known in the United States, the German
                    government was initially very reluctant to sign the Non-Proliferation
                    Treaty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Both Kiesinger and Brandt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Kiesinger much more so than Brandt, who had long thought that Germany
                    needed to renounce nuclear weapons. On the CDU side there was a consistent
                    record of resistance to anything which would close the door to German nuclear
                    weapons going back to Adenauer. Their basic point was that the FRG accepted the
                    fact that, as the loser of World War II, Germany could not expect to be allowed
                    to become a nuclear power in the short run. However, many of the CDU's
                    politicians, particularly on the right, did not want to make this a permanent
                    limitation on the German state. Given the ongoing French and British nuclear
                    programs, most Germans were keenly conscious of the fact that, by signing NPT,
                    they would put themselves in a position of permanent inferiority within
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>Their first preference was therefore not to have to agree to the NPT at all, and,
                    if that became unavoidable, to leave large enough loopholes to give Germany
                    fullest access to nuclear know-how and at least some theoretical possibility of
                    becoming a nuclear power under different circumstances. The issue for Bonn was
                    all the more poignant because, under the then prevailing NATO war plans, the
                    FRG's Tornados had, in fact, been assigned nuclear missions once the Soviet
                    Union had attacked, using weapons stored at Ramstein and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>At the same time, it was clear to everyone, that the USSR, and many others, would
                    not sign the NPT unless Germany adhered.</p>
                <p>The FRG's agreement was therefore crucial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whom did you deal with on the German side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Once the NPT project was launched, senior-level discussion between the
                    Embassy and the Foreign Office had run into major roadblocks. By the time I
                    appeared on the scene the principal German negotiator, Ambassador Swidbert
                    Schnippenkoetter - a tall, cultivated diplomat of the old school, whom we
                    respected personally even though he gave us a terrible time - had submitted
                    something like 117 textual changes to provide the FRG the loopholes we were just
                    talking about, and discussions were stalled. I was asked to work on this at the
                    working level as well as I could, simply to keep the discussion going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were brand new to all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Completely. I read the files, studied the backgrounders and talked to
                    everyone I could who might be able to shed some light on this arcane and
                    daunting subject. Even after I had achieved some degree of familiarity,
                    Ambassador Schnippenkoetter's many proposed changes often seemed impenetrable
                    and daunting.</p>
                <p>Then one day I met a thoughtful, civilized, young German diplomat at the Foreign
                    Office, Dieter Genscher, approximately at the same level as I, who worked in a
                    rather junior capacity under Schnippenkoetter. He had served in India, believed
                    passionately that Germany must never relapse into militarism, loved art and
                    music, had a lovely young family and played the flute.</p>
                <p>As we got to know each other it became clear to me that Dieter was as frustrated
                    as we were by his government's resistance to the NPT. Although he wanted Germany
                    to be treated fairly in the nuclear field, he did not want it to become a
                    potential nuclear weapons state and, like myself, thought that a globally
                    binding non-proliferation regime was essential.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that was a good start,</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Right. So, after we got to know each other a bit, I said to Dieter, “You
                    know, maybe we could meet weekly or biweekly, spend time together and look at
                    Schnippenkoetter's 117 or whatever proposed changes. Who knows, maybe we can
                    actually find some compromises here and there and get things going again?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The working-level approach.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. We tried it for a while, but the answers remained ambiguous and
                    didn't move the overall position. Then the atmosphere at higher levels got so
                    bad that Dieter and I had, what amounted to, surreptitious lunches, usually in
                    an obscure third-rate restaurant in Bonn.</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>Well, we ate a lot of goulash, came to know each other's positions better and
                    gradually saw that some minor trade-offs might be possible. I would go into
                    Washington with messages saying, “He can't make progress with Schnippenkoetter
                    on this, but he might be able on that. Can we give him some ammunition to help
                    him argue for a quid pro quo?” To establish credibility I would, from time to
                    time, show him my highly classified instructions so that he could see in writing
                    what the fallback position was and what my limits were. In time, Dieter would
                    reciprocate.</p>
                <p>Lo and behold, we began to inch forward, and we began to restore a certain amount
                    of trust. We kept eating goulash and negotiating, and eventually reached
                    mutually acceptable compromises on a number of the most difficult points.</p>
                <p>Then Schnippenkoetter absolutely floored us by producing a new set of objections,
                    which he had been quietly working up while we were negotiating the first batch!
                    The message was that even though some underbrush had been removed, the CDU/CSU
                    were not yet prepared to fold. So the process went on. Eventually though enough
                    progress was made that the senior people began talking again, the logjam was
                    broken, and, in due course, the Germans adhered to the Non-Proliferation
                    Treaty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How high a price did we have to pay to get there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Pretty high. To protect their high-tech industry, the Germans wanted to
                    assure free flow of technical information so that it not be frozen but
                    equalized. That's the point of Article IV, which probably would not have been
                    included but for German insistence. They also achieved limitations on the
                    numbers and roles of inspectors, since, as a very high-tech country, they were
                    jealous of and wanted to protect their trade secrets. These and a host of other
                    larger and minor changes were designed to allow the Germans to achieve a 'just
                    under the threshold' capability in plutonium production, which would leave them
                    only a short leap if they were ever to militarize and break the Treaty. Since
                    these concessions also had to be given to the other signatories, the deal made
                    with the FRG both saved and weakened the NPT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even so, NPT has significantly slowed the expansion of
                        nuclear weapons states.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That was the pay-off. Most of those we thought might go for nuclear
                    weapons programs in the fifties and sixties did not do so and became
                    signatories, making the NPT a major success. Our problems are with the
                    relatively few countries who held out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to Schnippenkoetter?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Its interesting you should ask that. Shortly before I left Bonn, I was in
                    Baden-Baden for some reason and learned of a public meeting where then just
                    retired Ambassador Schnippenkoetter was to speak on Germany's acceptance of the
                    Non-Proliferation Treaty. He did his best to explain the subtle trade-offs in
                    which the FRG got a good deal of what it wanted without having to take the blame
                    for scuttling non-proliferation. But his nationalist audience would have none of
                    it. As the old diplomat tried to hold his own on the stage he was yelled at,
                    booed and jeered, and finally accused of betraying Germany's historic future. In
                    the end he turned on them and said with great anguish that he had spent his
                    whole life in the service of the German interest and that no one had a right to
                    call him unpatriotic - and then began crying in anger and in shame.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really? Did these critics of the NPT represent a
                        significant political force within the Christian Democratic Party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Certainly Franz-Joseph Strauss and his Bavarians had been clamoring for a
                    hard line. While the issue was not center stage in public discussion, there was
                    significant sentiment among the center Right and beyond, who felt that Bonn
                    should not permanently be denied a nuclear option and become a 'lesser' country
                    than France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Free Democrats' position on all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: They weren't really major players, since this was the time of the
                    Kiesinger/Brandt Grand Coalition. They were on the nationalist side, but didn't
                    seriously rock the boat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is very interesting, and shows how important
                        issues can sometimes be ironed out at relatively low diplomatic levels.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. It certainly helped in this case where, in the NPT's
                    darkest hours, we were the only two people left in Bonn who were talking about
                    it constructively and so helped keep it from dying.</p>
                <p>Needless to say, the NPT was a game played at many levels and in several arenas.
                    For instance, Germany's eventual commitment to sign the NPT was one of the key
                    concessions Brandt, as the grand Coalition's Foreign Minister made to get
                    Brezhnev to take Ostpolitik seriously, and was the sine qua non of the
                    Brandt-Kosygin treaty signed in Moscow in August of 1970. Kissinger's hand in
                    all this is still another story.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's what I mean. A diplomatic disagreement gets
                        tentatively resolved at your level and then eventually you get the people up
                        above to come together on it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: In practical terms, what's critical in negotiating is the quality of the
                    people involved and their personal relations, not position and rank. I have seen
                    Ambassadors go in, make stiff formalistic speeches on instruction and get
                    absolutely nowhere. What generates compromise and agreement is a degree of
                    mutual trust and empathy; a very firm grip on the issues; and then patient give
                    and take until a balanced outcome begins to take shape that arguably respects
                    everybody's interests. To get there both sides invariably have to be willing go
                    a little bit beyond the edge of the cliff, beyond their authorized instructions.
                    Its a creative, and therefore risky process at whatever level.</p>
                <p>f. Ostpolitik and changing east-west relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the other issues in your work in
                        Bonn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Besides NPT, there were other the arms control questions, i.e. early
                    stirrings of Mutual Balanced Force Reduction (MBFR) driven by Congressional
                    interest in reducing the level of US troop commitments in Europe, there was the
                    Seabeds Treaty etc. But the major focus of my work was on Brandt's Ostpolitik
                    and its effects on East-West relationships.</p>
                <p>Brandt, had successively pushed his new principles of east-west detente, first in
                    the Berlin context, then as Foreign Minister and finally as Chancellor. As we
                    said earlier, this had initially caused some anxiety in Washington, particularly
                    since it was feared Brandt's Ostpolitik could precipitate Soviet recognition of
                    the GDR as a separate German state, thus ending post-war quadripartite
                    arrangements and creating a permanent division of Germany. The irony was, that
                    that's precisely what happened, except that it occurred with our approval and
                    participation in 1971, and laid the basis for the eventual reunification of
                    Germany some decades later.</p>
                <p>It was a dramatic high stakes game with major ramifications for France and the
                    future of the European project, played out against the backdrop of Viet-Nam in
                    the late Johnson and early Nixon years, when we were still hanging very
                    tough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during critical years. Did you appreciate
                        the complexity and full import of this historic maneuver at the time as you
                        watched it unfold in fits and starts, as we now do when so much has been
                        declassified and written about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Only gradually. The first thing one had to grasp was that the CDU/CSU
                    coalition had not one but two foreign policies, since Brandt, then Foreign
                    Minister, was prepared to go much farther with his Ostpolitik than Chancellor
                    Kiesinger. The result was an evolving compromise, with slowly increasing
                    emphasis on detente as the lever to transform things and eventually achieve
                    German reunification, replacing the CDU's traditional policy, enshrined in the
                    Hallstein doctrine, of trying to isolate East Germany. Within this context
                    Brandt and the SPD were consistently out front calling for more and further
                    moves, such as acceptance of the Oder-Neisse line, de facto, but not yet de
                    jure, recognition of the GDR, agreement to the NPT etc. All were agreed,
                    however, to expanding trade with the USSR, the GDR and the other eastern
                    European satellites, a commercial policy which proved eminently successful and
                    seductive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Moscow and its satellites react to all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That was still another dimension of this intricate story. Among the
                    satellites, the DDR was consistently the most negative and felt most threatened,
                    even though it too accepted increased trade and substantial FRG credits. The
                    first major breakthroughs came in Bonn's establishment of relations with
                    Bucharest and later Belgrade, both somewhat costly successes since they led to
                    renewed pressure by the hardline countries, Poland, the DDR and Moscow, to block
                    Hungary and Czechoslovakia from following suite; and led to a general hardening
                    of Moscow's position. This was reinforced by the rapidly evolving situation in
                    Czechoslovakia where liberalization was threatening to spiral out of control,
                    with Novotny's replacement by Dubcek early in 1968. Soviet diplomatic notes and
                    declarations became increasingly harsh and uncompromising.</p>
                <p>Even so, there were interesting nuances which suggested that, even during this
                    tense time, Moscow was not entirely disinterested in or insensitive to what
                    Brandt's Ostpolitik was trying to achieve, since some there undoubtedly
                    understood that a successful east-west rapprochement would substantially reduce
                    the need for American forces in Europe and so weaken the US role on the
                    continent. Abrassimov, Moscow's pro-Consul in the DDR, for instance, told
                    Brandt, at a time when the DDR was beating the drums, that they too wanted to
                    keep the Berlin issue quiet. Other subtle differences emerged, for instance in
                    Moscow's tacit failure to insist on de jure recognition of the DDR in
                    discussions with Brandt, which Honecker still shrilly insisted on.</p>
                <p>Last, but far from least, were the still broader questions of how all this played
                    in Paris, in the European and in the Atlantic contexts, each of which had their
                    own, often quite different reactions, which in turn became parts of the
                    parallelogram of forces which affected the players positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how on earth did you manage all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Most of the work was necessarily day-by-day information gathering,
                    reporting and analysis. You do learn quite a lot from what you are told
                    officially and from careful readings of speeches and official statements, where
                    shadings in emphasis usually suggest evolving policy positions. You then follow
                    up and try to find out what really happened and what it might mean, on the
                    usually correct assumption that official accounts you get at the Foreign Office
                    or elsewhere are at best only half the story.</p>
                <p>That meant talking to journalists who follow the story and have good contacts;
                    exchanging information with other Embassies; getting around parliamentarians of
                    various parties who also want to know what's going on and have their own
                    sources; staying in touch with scholars who follow these issues; and, last but
                    not least, maintaining contacts with the Soviets and particularly the Eastern
                    Europeans, each of whom tended to have their slightly unique line on Ostpolitik
                    developments.</p>
                <p>The trick was to quickly get a reasonably rounded picture of a particular event,
                    i.e. a German negotiation with Poland, or a Brandt meeting with the DDR to find
                    out and then coherently report what happened and what it meant. As successive
                    episodes coalesced we were able to produce periodic think pieces on the larger
                    picture as we came to understand it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To pick up on one point you just made, you did have
                        contacts with the Soviet and East European representatives in Bonn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, we had a good number of contacts in the satellite Embassies and even
                    a few among the Soviets. But they were always cautious and were reported to the
                    CIA. I'll never forget the first Soviet Embassy officer I had lunch with in
                    Bonn, a green KGB type fresh from some training school in the USSR who literally
                    didn't know how to order a pizza in an Italian restaurant. But that was not the
                    norm, Many of the eastern Europeans were fairly sophisticated people, some with
                    good language skills, and some were occasionally willing, sometimes even eager,
                    to tell us their versions of some current events. The trouble was that in all
                    these contacts there was always the risk of being compromised. An additional
                    complication was that our parties and receptions were sometimes used as rather
                    too transparent cover by the Bonn Station to cultivate Soviets or Eastern
                    Europeans they were interested in.</p>

                <p>JAEGER: The arrival of Dubcek as head of the Czech Communist party in early 1968
                    was seen from the outset as a critical event which, if successful, would
                    substantiate Brandt's argument that change in the Soviet orbit was possible. The
                    sixty four thousand dollar question was, of course, how much liberalization
                    could be brought about before Moscow felt threatened and decided it had to
                    react. The next question was whether a Soviet clampdown would be the end of
                    rapprochement and Ostpolitik, or only a temporary blip.</p>
                <p>We therefore watched Dubcek's high-wire act with intense interest as he
                    introduced his “Socialism with a Human Face,” which permitted greater freedom of
                    expression and less censorship, while he and his officials tried to reassure
                    Moscow that they were still good Communists and had no intention of withdrawing
                    from the Warsaw Pact - so as not to repeat the mistake, some argued, which had
                    been made by Hungary in 1956.</p>
                <p>The Czechs' reaction, as you know, was electric. Dubcek quickly gained mass
                    support and it became obvious that the pressures for greater freedom would be
                    difficult to restrain and might well spread to other Soviet satellites. We now
                    know that the Kremlin had some hesitations before it to reached the decision to
                    intervene on August 20, 1968, when the USSR and some of its other Warsaw Pact
                    allies marched in, deposed Dubcek and occupied the country - a clear act of
                    aggression which Moscow subsequently tried to rationalize with the Brezhnev
                    doctrine.</p>
                <p>It was not until the doctrine was again put to the test in 1989, when Gorbachev
                    proved unwilling to use force to maintain Warsaw pact discipline, that
                    Czechoslovakia, this time inspired by Vaclav Havel's Velvet Revolution, was to
                    regain its freedom and the disintegrating Soviet empire its end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing when all this happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: We had of course been following events closely and were hoping against
                    hope that Dubcek would somehow get away with it.</p>
                <p>The crisis came at two or three in the morning on August 20, when, as the Embassy
                    duty officer, I was called by our communications people and told that I had
                    better get myself to the office quickly because the Russians were invading
                    Czechoslovakia. I got there in record time and found a storm of top secret and
                    flash telegrams from Washington and elsewhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>Our instruction was that Embassy Bonn was to make sure that the American military
                    commands understood that they were to stand down, that they were not to move
                    troops, that everybody was to stay in their barracks, and that we were not even
                    to go to a significant alert status. The point was not to give the Soviets any
                    reason whatever to think that we would intervene, and so risk a broader conflict
                    - a huge let-down for the Czechs, who had been heartened by the progress they
                    had made and had probably been misled by the enthusiastic support Dubcek had
                    been getting in the Western press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, it was very dispiriting work. I called the Duty Officers at all our
                    major commands to pass these instructions along, the idea being to reinforce
                    orders they had presumably already received through their own military channels.
                    I was then able to open a telephone channel with our Embassy in Prague, to ask
                    if they needed help. As we were speaking, I could hear the Soviet machine guns
                    rattling in the background, and the muffled noise of the street battle in
                    Prague. Our colleagues thought that they were safe for the time being, but we
                    kept the line open just to be sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Must have been pretty hair-raising to be a witness to all
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. All in all, it was probably the worst night I spent in the Foreign
                    Service, because of our utter impotence. Washington, quite predictably, had
                    decided not to intervene; no major moves were to be made to reverse this Russian
                    aggression; and, so, the Prague Spring, which had filled us all with such great
                    hope, was obviously down the drain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Much like the Hungarian situation in 1956?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Precisely. For me, the historic drama being played out on the streets in
                    Prague, had a ludicrous counter-point.</p>
                <p>For, besides all the major stuff we were trying to cope with, one of the most
                    immediate issues we had to resolve was when we should wake up Ambassador
                    Lodge!</p>
                <p>Lodge had left clear instructions that he was not to be disturbed at night unless
                    there was a “major war.” Since we were clearly not yet at that point, I had
                    several discussions during that night and early morning with our DCM, Russ
                    Fessenden, as to when it was safe to wake up the Ambassador to tell him that
                    there was an invasion going on next door. I think it was finally decided to do
                    so at 6 AM, and remember hearing that Lodge was none too pleased.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: After this long dramatic night, I was relieved from duty around
                    mid-morning to get some rest, but couldn't sleep. So I wandered aimlessly around
                    Bonn for hours - it was a drizzly sort of a day - trying to sort out my thoughts
                    and emotions. I was walking down a small street when I heard absolutely divine
                    sounds coming from the windows of a Gymnasium I happened to be passing. It was a
                    chamber music concert. I followed the sounds, went in and found the Novak
                    Quartet, a famous group from Prague, in an afternoon concert I had in fact seen
                    advertised, performing exquisitely on the school's modest stage. I sat down and
                    listened, enthralled. It was the cathartic experience I had needed.</p>
                <p>And then I had an idea. Our instructions were to do absolutely nothing about the
                    invasion, no speeches, rallies, protests or statements. Even so, I thought,
                    nobody could blame us if we simply put on a concert!</p>
                <p>So, in the intermission, I went backstage, introduced myself, and said to Novak
                    and his three colleagues, “If I can arrange it, would you come and play at the
                    American Embassy in a tribute to the Prague Spring and the Czech spirit of
                    liberty and resistance? If so, we'll invite all the key people in Germany!”
                    Since this would be dangerous for them personally, they said they needed a
                    little time to consider and would give me their answer after the concert. The
                    answer was wholeheartedly, yes.</p>
                <p>I took my project back to the Embassy, where Russ Fessenden, who was Charg�, gave
                    it his immediate and unstinting support. So we went to work and three days later
                    two hundred some dignitaries, representing the cream of the FRG's political and
                    cultural world, were assembled in a salon at the Residence. Besides Brandt,
                    there were cabinet ministers, senior party leaders, parliamentarians, Presidents
                    of some of the Laender, key journalists, Ambassadors, as well as distinguished
                    academic and business leaders.</p>
                <p>There was a moment of intense silence before the Novak Quartet began - not with
                    Dvorak, as we had all expected, but with Hayden's deeply moving “Kaiser
                    Quartet”, the source of the German national anthem - perhaps to thank their
                    German neighbors for their sympathy. They then played Mozart, some Beethoven,
                    and finally did end with the 'Moldau', with tears streaming down their faces. It
                    was a very, very moving event which helped get the message out to people across
                    Germany that, in spite of our official silence and inaction, we did deeply
                    care.</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>After the concert the Novak quartet came to my place for dinner, drank a lot of
                    wine and listened to some of my classical records, which they thought
                    incredible, because good records were still so scarce behind the Curtain. The
                    issue they then had to face was what to do next. By the time they left my place,
                    two had decided to defect to the West, and two, including Novak himself, went
                    back to Prague. Novak, at least, survived the experience, since I've
                    occasionally seen his name on programs in subsequent years. They inscribed a
                    group photo for me, which I still have, to mark the event.</p>
                <p>h. Brandt in power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we know in retrospect, the Czech invasion didn't put an
                        end to Ostpolitik. As you saw it, what happened when Brandt became
                        Chancellor, and the SPD/FDP government succeeded the Grand Coalition in
                        1969?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The new left-coalition, as it was called, reflected an evolving shift in
                    German public attitudes: Greater acceptance of detente with Moscow, increased
                    willingness to accept the Oder-Neisse line as Germany's eastern border, and
                    fewer illusions about early German reunification, or for that matter European
                    unification.</p>
                <p>Most importantly, by being willing to accept the existence of the DDR de facto,
                    the new Brandt/Scheel government was in effect agreeing to the division of
                    Germany temporarily, hoping that Ostpolitik would produce the further
                    improvements in east-west relations, which, in time, would make reunification
                    possible. It was Brandt's great merit that this vision would in fact be
                    realized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember hearing of differences in this period between
                        Brandt and his SPD colleague Helmut Schmidt? How did that play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Helmut Schmidt, then Defense Minister, was a firm Atlanticist who thought
                    Herbert Wehner, the dour sage of the SPD's left wing, and Egon Bahr, Brandt's
                    principal advisor, were leading the FRG astray by too great an emphasis on
                    detente with the east, a discussion we at the Embassy tried to follow closely.
                    Since the shock of the Czech invasion had underscored the continuing importance
                    to the FRG of its Atlantic security ties in a world of nuclear parity, Brandt,
                    one had the impression, steered gingerly between these conflicted SPD forces. As
                    it turned out Ostpolitik would be a much more fundamental threat to the Soviet
                    system than to NATO, although no one knew that at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did all this play out in practice?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>JAEGER: In a series of complex interrelated negotiations, all of which I followed
                    and reported on. There were negotiations between Bonn and Moscow, in which
                    Gromyko in effect accepted the principle of de facto recognition of the DDR;
                    difficult and slow FRG-Polish negotiations, which eventually succeeded and made
                    clear that the FRG accepted the Oder Neisse line; parallel negotiations and
                    contacts with the other satellites, particularly Hungary and Czechoslovakia, as
                    well ongoing consultations with Yugoslavia; and, for the first time, direct
                    meetings between Brandt and the DDR leader Willy Stoph in early 1970 in Erfurt
                    and then in Kassel, in which Stoph regurgitated standard East German positions,
                    including his insistence on de jure recognition. Even so, they were a useful and
                    necessary prelude to the subsequent Berlin negotiations, which were eventually
                    successful. Last but not least, there were successive major Bundestag debates on
                    Ostpolitik, which I also covered.</p>
                <p>After I had left Bonn in June 1970, the story went on with the fall of Ulbricht,
                    who had resisted Moscow's now increasing interest in detente, and finally in the
                    East-West German negotiations which regularized the relationship further.
                    Besides all this, there were of course trade and credit negotiations to help
                    lubricate the process, the signature of the NPT, critically important to gain
                    Moscow's assent, and discussions and agreements which prepared the ground for
                    the eventual European Security Conference, which in due course produced the
                    Helsinki Final Act.</p>
                <p>Taken together, Brandt and Bahr's Ostpolitik had changed the course of German
                    relationships with the East dramatically and set the stage for the ultimate
                    breakup of the Soviet system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been tremendously interesting to be involved
                        in all this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes and a great deal of often very intense work involving reams of
                    reports and analyses. It would be interesting, in retrospect to be able to
                    reread this material to see how much of what was going on we actually
                    understood. I suspect there were major gaps, since I and my Embassy colleagues
                    were not privy to much that Kissinger was doing as the then National Security
                    Advisor, and did not have a full picture of Egon Bahr's sometimes very secretive
                    dealings with Moscow, the DDR and others. Even so the major outlines of the
                    issues involved were clear. (Note: An official US summary of these complex
                    events is at http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga5-710903.htm)</p>
                <p>i. German domestic politics</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about German domestic politics in this period
                        '6'70?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I did also work a bit on some German domestic issues, and particularly on
                    the FDP.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I had the opportunity to go to their political conventions, and to meet
                    lots of their politicians, including the young, high-octane member of
                    parliament, later Brandt's Interior Minister in the SPD/FDP coalition,
                    Hans-Dietrich Genscher. He was the party's rapidly rising star.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And subsequently foreign minister for many years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: ...and subsequently foreign minister. As we came to know each other he
                    would sometimes give me a lift into town, the only person I knew at the time who
                    could drive a car and talk on a phone at the same time. This was still so
                    unusual, that it produced cartoons in the press showing an overweight Genscher,
                    driving frantically, while yakking into his mobile telephone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a very different world from the major east-west
                        negotiations and NPT.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. It was much easier to follow and report on the political intrigues
                    and shenanigans of leading FDP politicians, who managed this slightly right of
                    center swing party, and to follow their discussions on social and foreign
                    policy. Their critical decision was to overcome their traditional conservatism
                    and join the SPD in the Brandt/Scheel coalition, when the chance to come to
                    power presented itself in 1969</p>
                <p>j. Jock Dean</p>
                <p>JAEGER: I think it might be useful in this context to say a word about Jock Dean,
                    who was Sutterlin's successor as Political Counselor.</p>
                <p>He was one of the most effective, and perhaps least loved, American diplomats of
                    his time, who combined broad knowledge of German affairs with a fierce
                    determination to move the process forward. Jock has had many detractors. He
                    needed teams of often exhausted secretaries to dictate his lengthy telegrams and
                    memos, which were usually perceptive, sometimes brilliant, but might often have
                    benefited from extensive pruning.</p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>Nor was he, to put it politely, particularly gifted in human relations or office
                    management, since he was consistently demanding, never suffered fools gladly and
                    was often curt and sarcastic with people to the point of wounding. I vividly
                    remember the scene he made when his wife Thea ran out of some wine he was
                    serving at one of his lunches; or the chill at the huge good-bye party he gave
                    for his Deputy Gerry Livingston, myself and a few others at the end of our
                    tours. When it was Gerry's turn he gave him a long object wrapped in newspaper,
                    which turned out to be a stick of bamboo. “To help Gerry”, Dean said to the
                    assembly of Embassy staff and German officials, “stiffen his backbone!”.
                    Everyone literally gasped. I got off rather easily by comparison with a
                    nondescript gift and a few kind words. I do owe him gratitude for his
                    forbearance while I made several trips to the States during my mother's final
                    illness in 1969. She died in Kansas City on September 8.</p>
                <p>Where Jock did shine was in his capacity to insert himself into the German
                    conversation and to get the highest-level Germans to confide in him or to
                    discuss their problems and differences in our presence - a process which not
                    only provided critical real-time information, but enabled him to make himself,
                    and some of us, part of their policy process.</p>
                <p>His most effective device was his famous “Dean lunch”, at which, once a week, he
                    would gather eight or ten senior political figures and government officials at
                    his house over very good food and first-rate wines, and then throw major
                    questions on the table. The results were sometimes extraordinarily frank and
                    penetrating debates among his German guests, which framed the ongoing issues and
                    enabled him to inject not only further questions but positions and ideas. As a
                    result Dean's lunches became a unique policy forum, which brought people
                    together from across the political spectrum, at which major issues were
                    discussed across party and policy lines and sometimes resolved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he tape record all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: No, that wouldn't have been necessary, since he always included one or
                    two of us to participate and help report. This always produced a stream of
                    telegrams, on foreign policy and domestic issues, since the people invited -
                    Ministers or other senior officials, party leaders or their deputies, leaders in
                    the Bundestag, senior intellectuals etc. - were all major players whose views
                    were important. They, in effect, provided a unique forum to influence and
                    cross-fertilize thinking which was, I think as much appreciated by the Germans
                    as ourselves. Without these lunches the reporting and analytic tasks of this
                    important period would have been much more difficult.</p>
                <p>k. David Binder</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume journalists often tried to pick your brains about
                        all these issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Of course, journalists were constantly trying to find out what was going
                    on. Because of my work on the east-west issues, I had a close, but somewhat
                    fraught, relationship with David Binder of the New York Times, who was
                    brilliantly covering the Bonn scene during much of this period, but twice came
                    close to getting me in trouble. One case involved a potential Eastern European
                    defector, the other Cardinal Mindszenty's aborted plans to leave the Embassy in
                    Budapest before Ambassador Hillenbrand's arrival; coupled, if I remember this
                    correctly, with rumors Binder had picked up in Budapest that Hillenbrand might
                    bring with him the Crown of St. Stephen, which had been safeguarded in Ft. Knox
                    - a move which would have greatly upset anti-Communist and �migr� Hungarians and
                    did not take place until 1977 when President Carter decided to return the crown.
                    It took considerable effort on my part to persuade Marty Hillenbrand, whom I
                    respected enormously and for whom I had great affection, that I was the victim
                    of overeager journalism. Binder, who had a passion for scoops, would pick up
                    scraps here and there and then somehow try to source them to the Embassy. That
                    said, he was a first-rate, very prolific reporter and, generally, a fine
                    analyst.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any personal reflections about the years in Bonn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>l. Getting married.</p>
                <p>JAEGER: I have almost left out the main event, that Pat and I got married!</p>
                <p>1969 had personally been sad and difficult because my mother, then over eighty,
                    was suffering from increasingly serious cardiac problems and I had to make
                    several emergency trips on military flights to Kansas City to see her before she
                    finally died on September 8. She had had an extraordinarily hard and challenging
                    life, had been a strong and intensely loving wife and mother, and left me with a
                    great sense of loss.</p>
                <p>But life goes on. On New Year's eve 1970 I got a call asking me to return to
                    Washington urgently to be Deputy Staff Director of John J. McCloy's General
                    Advisory Committee on Arms Control and Disarmament. This was obviously a
                    super-opportunity, so we put wedding plans into high gear and were married on
                    Monday January 12 1970 in the great Abbey Church of Einsiedeln in Switzerland's
                    Canton Schwyz.</p>
                <p>As all this happened very quickly, it was only on the preceding Friday that I
                    walked into Jock Dean's office, frantically dictating telegrams and looking
                    tense and distraught, interrupted and said, “Jock, I'm off for two weeks because
                    I'm getting married!”</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>This was a bombshell, since I had been commuting to Brussels, and met Pat at
                    other places for weekends, and no one at the Embassy had been aware of Pat, or
                    of our plans. Jock, interrupted his dictation just long enough to say “No way!
                    You still owe me three telegrams!” It occurred to me later that I should perhaps
                    have done more to prepare the ground. As it was, I just said, with as much calm
                    as I could muster, “Well, that's too bad. I'm getting married!” And with that I
                    left on somewhat less than friendly terms.</p>
                <p>It was during our wedding service at Einsiedeln, as an ancient monk was saying
                    mass at a baroque side altar, and the great organ was playing Bach, that another
                    monk in old slippers shuffled towards us bearing a silver salver with an
                    envelope which he put on my pew. It was a telegram with the European Post
                    Offices' markings of highest urgency to be used only in case of imminent war or
                    similar major crises, which, as I was told later, the only priority justifying
                    the interruption of church services in Europe.</p>
                <p>I thought, of course, that somebody had died or something equally dreadful had
                    happened. I opened the envelope and there was a message from Jock Dean. It said,
                    “Okay, you bastard. Wish you the best of luck. I wrote your telegrams.
                    Jock.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: So, after our honeymoon in Klosters, we returned with Jock's blessings
                    and in good graces. Since, as it turned out, we didn't have to leave for
                    Washington for several more months after all, Pat and I were able to make the
                    most of our villa 'Am Stadtwald' that spring, had parties and receptions and
                    much enjoyed our new life together.</p>
                <p>The only fly in the ointment proved to be my housekeeper Ivanka, who, instead of
                    making us lovely meals, fell ill and for several weeks required nursing, a
                    process in which her dark-suited husband, visiting from Zagreb, was of zero
                    help. So Pat had a rather stressful introduction to her new life. But things
                    picked up again after this episode was over and our life together over the last
                    twenty eight years has been happier and more rewarding than anything I could
                    have hoped for.</p>
                <p>Part VI: The General Advisory Committee, then National War College</p>
                <p>1. Staff Director of the McCloy Committee</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in 1970 you moved from Bonn back to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. As I said, my old friend Tom Fina rang in the middle of our New
                    Year's eve party to tell me that I needed get back to Washington as soon as
                    possible, because John J. McCloy wanted me to be Deputy Staff Director of his
                    General Advisory Committee on Arms Control and Disarmament. Fina, who then had
                    the top job, said he would be leaving soon to work at the White House, and
                    wanted to break me in to take over his job. I told Tom that Pat and I were
                    getting married, hence couldn't leave immediately, but that we could make it in
                    a month.</p>
                <p>a. First, three months in INR</p>
                <p>JAEGER: As it turned out, it was a premature alarm, since the McCloy job didn't
                    open up till the following November. We therefore stayed in Bonn till June, and
                    then, after home leave, had a three month interim assignment in the just created
                    Office of Strategic and General Research, a start-up operation in INR (the
                    Bureau of Intelligence and Research) with a tiny staff and access to 'all
                    source' intelligence, which was supposed to look at major issues on a global
                    basis.</p>
                <p>Their unsolved problem was how to define those issues in ways relevant and useful
                    to senior policy makers, so they did the next best thing, filling gaps in INR's
                    existing coverage. In my case - I had been asked to work on arms control - this
                    meant doing a spate of papers on the proposed treaty on arms control on the
                    seabeds, possible new naval arms control measures, the problems facing the
                    International Atomic Energy Agency in developing and applying safeguards, and
                    German attitudes on Mutual Balanced Force Reductions.</p>
                <p>While all this was interesting and perhaps useful, the office was still a
                    project-in-search-of-a-mission. At that point it had neither the resources,
                    leadership nor high-level 'customer' base to assure success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though this is quite a crucial time in arms control
                        when the Nixon administration was moving towards those negotiations and
                        treaties with the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Remember, I was one guy supposed to do INR's 'global' thinking for
                    State's arms control community, which at that point knew a great deal more about
                    their business than I did. Perhaps if I had stayed for several years, built up a
                    reputation and become an integrated part of the senior arms control world the
                    job could have become significant. As it was I laid a few bricks in an
                    unfinished building and was rather glad when, in November 1970, I was finally
                    able to move over to my new role as Deputy Staff Director on the McCloy
                    Committee.</p>
                <p>b. How the General Advisory Committee on Arms Control andDisarmament came into
                    being.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us first about the General Advisory Committee and its
                        origins and history.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>JAEGER: It all goes back to the beginnings of the Kennedy administration, when
                    the new President was trying to bring some of the major east coast establishment
                    figures into the cabinet to give it experience and weight, even though they were
                    mostly liberal Republicans. The preeminent figure, of course, was John J.
                    McCloy, the formidable New York lawyer, who had played critical roles before and
                    during World War II, built the Pentagon, ruled the American Sector of Germany as
                    High Commissioner after the war, was a key player in the international oil world
                    and the centerpiece of the Council of Foreign Relations in New York, the
                    establishment's home base.</p>
                <p>As Kai Bird reported in his McCloy biography “The Chairman”, Kennedy tried to get
                    him to accept Defense or Treasury, but didn't offer him State, the one job
                    McCloy really wanted, but which Kennedy thought he needed to fill with a
                    Democrat, Dean Rusk. In the end he asked McCloy if he would be his Disarmament
                    Advisor, a broad undefined role in a critically important field in which McCloy
                    was keenly interested.</p>
                <p>The rest is history. Besides quickly becoming a key intermediary with the USSR on
                    the test-ban issue and the development of broader disarmament principles, he met
                    for several days with Khrushchev in the Crimea in friendly but in the end
                    unproductive discussions. When the USSR tested shortly thereafter, Kennedy
                    followed McCloy's advice and responded with American tests. Although McCloy was
                    a firm believer in nuclear disarmament, he thought it essential that we not let
                    the Soviets push us around if a sound basis for negotiations was to be laid.</p>
                <p>His main contribution, after difficult negotiations both within the Executive
                    Branch and with the Congress, was the passage of the Arms Control and
                    Disarmament Act of 1961, which McCloy had pressed for with passion, because he
                    was convinced that no coherent long-term arms control policy would emerge if
                    left to the existing Departments.</p>
                <p>The result was ACDA, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, a quasi-independent
                    organization within State, reporting both to the Secretary of State and the
                    President. To assure himself a long-term role in the process, McCloy included in
                    the Act a provision establishing the 'General Advisory Committee on Arms Control
                    and Disarmament', whose broad mission paralleled ACDA's: “To advise the
                    President, the Secretary of State and the Disarmament Director respecting
                    matters affecting arms control, disarmament and world peace”. McCloy was sworn
                    in by President Kennedy as its first Chairman in April 1962.</p>
                <p>c. The GAC's role in the Nixon years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came along not quite ten years later.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. In the intervening years the GAC, as the Committee came to
                    be called, had had its ups and downs and had become rather moribund in the late
                    Johnson years. When Nixon was elected, McCloy recalled in one of our many
                    conversations, the new President decided to reconstitute the GAC with a new
                    group of heavy-weights as part of the administration's effort to gear up for the
                    several major arms control negotiations about to be launched with the USSR, and
                    asked McCloy to continue as Chairman.</p>
                <p>The issue was, of course, whether the reconstituted GAC would have any clout or
                    would share the fate of most advisory groups, who are formed, then sidelined and
                    forgotten. In his characteristically blunt and honest way, McCloy said, as he
                    recounted it, “Mr. President, I've served under a whole bunch of Presidents, and
                    lately this Committee hasn't been listened to very much, and hasn't played a
                    very important role. Frankly, I can get a better chicken lunch in New York. So,
                    if, from time to time, you really do want our advice, the Committee would need
                    to have unrestricted access to all source intelligence and the authority to
                    summon anyone we need to hear to appear before it. If that can be agreed, I will

                <p>Nixon readily agreed and the GAC was back in business.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the members when you came on board?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It was in every sense a blue-ribbon group, attracted by the critical
                    importance of the issues the Committee was to consider and by McCloy's continued
                    chairmanship. The members were:</p>
                <p>?I.W. Abel, the President of the United Steel Workers of America; ? ?Harold
                    Brown, the former Secretary of the Air Force who was President of the California
                    Institute of Technology and member of the SALT delegation; ? ?William C. Foster,
                    the former Director of ACDA and former Deputy Secretary of Defense; ? ?Kermit
                    Gordon, the President of the Brookings Institution and former Director of the
                    Bureau of the Budget; ? ?James Killian, the former President of MIT and Chairman
                    of president Eisenhower's Science Advisory Committee created after Sputnik; ?
                    ?General Lauris Norstad, Former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, then
                    Chairman of the Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corporation; ? ?Jack Ruina, Professor
                    of Electrical Engineering at MIT and former President of the Institute for
                    Defense Analysis; ? ?Dean Rusk, the former Secretary of State; ? ?William
                    Scranton, former Governor of Pennsylvania; ? <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                    ?John Wheeler, Professor of Physics at Princeton, a preeminent cosmological
                    physicist and one of the discoverers of 'black holes', who had been a senior
                    member of the Manhattan and hydrogen bomb projects. ? ?And for a time, William
                    Casey, the former SEC Chairman and later Reagan's CIA Director. ? Q: That's
                    quite a line-up. What were the major issues facing the Committee and how did
                    they address them?</p>
                <p>JAEGER: I'll skim over the surface. After many years during which no major arms
                    control agreements had been achieved, the Nixon administration had decided to
                    enter the Helsinki negotiations on 'Strategic Arms Limitation' or SALT I, as it
                    came to be known, in November 1969. The object was to reduce the threat of
                    nuclear war, increase long-term strategic stability and improve the
                    international environment so that further reductions might become possible in
                    the future.</p>
                <p>This meant, in the first place, identifying what weapons systems were to be
                    covered, a task which posed considerable problems because of the asymmetries
                    involved. By May 1971, it was agreed to concentrate initially on an Anti
                    Ballistic Missile (ABM) agreement and on an interim agreement on limiting
                    offensive strategic weapons.</p>
                <p>The rationale was that unconstrained ABM development would simply lead to the
                    deployment of more and more offensive systems, undermining stability and so
                    driving the arms race. By eliminating ABMs, except for two tightly defined
                    complexes on each side, and arresting the number of offensive strategic weapons,
                    the burgeoning arms race might, it was hoped, be arrested by SALT I, to be
                    further ratcheted down in follow-on negotiations.</p>
                <p>Each of these issues in turn, involved a large number of critical subsidiary
                    issues, some of which were highly technical, such as the size and location of
                    the two eventually agreed ABM deployment areas, the nature of acceptable ABM
                    radars and the distance by which they must be separated; or, in the case of
                    offensive weapons, whether, besides Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs),
                    Sea Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) or land-mobile ICBMs should be included,
                    and whether the limitations should apply to both missiles and warheads and, if
                    so, how.</p>
                <p>In addition there were major qualitative issues to consider and negotiate, such
                    as a prohibition of conversion of 'light' to 'heavy' missiles, and most
                    importantly the question of MIRVing, i.e. whether limitations should be placed
                    on missiles with 'multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles' (MIRVs), a
                    category in which we were ahead at the time, but which threatened to be
                    profoundly destabilizing.</p>
                <p>Finally there was the matter of reliably verifying whatever agreements were to be
                    reached, issues which involved the capabilities of satellites and other
                    'national technical means' as well as political commitments not to
                    interfere.</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>As if all this were not enough, beyond these complex SALT I issues there were
                    still others: Ongoing ruminations about possible Mutual Balanced Force Reduction
                    (MBFR) negotiations of the two sides' forces in Europe, a process which would be
                    launched at the Moscow Summit in 1972; further work on safeguards and
                    verification under the Non-Proliferation Agreement; as well as the discussions
                    and negotiations carried on at the UN's 'Conference of the Committee on
                    Disarmament' (the CCD) in Geneva on extending the partial nuclear test ban to
                    cover underground nuclear tests, on limiting chemical and biological weapons
                    etc..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was the universe of questions the GAC had on its
                        plate. How on earth did you address all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I had the good fortune that my friend Tom Fina, McCloy's first Staff
                    Director, had not only established the Committee's very effective operating
                    pattern, but had carved out a consensus on the central issues on which its
                    advice to the President, the Secretary of State and the Director of ACDA would
                    be important.</p>
                <p>In effect when I took over as Staff Director in early April 1971 the McCloy
                    Committee had already, in a series of letters to the White House and its other
                    advisees, unanimously endorsed the importance of reaching an interim SALT I
                    agreement, coupled with an ABM and MIRV ban, a package which, taken together
                    would have gone far to stabilize the nuclear arms race.</p>
                <p>Even so, Fina frustrated by Kissinger's consistent opposition to a MIRV ban
                    without which strategic stability could clearly not be achieved, left the GAC
                    for, what turned out to be an unhappy experience, working for Peter Peterson in
                    the White House,</p>
                <p>Moreover, the Committee had not had an opportunity to present its views directly
                    to the President, and was not certain that its recommendations, routed through
                    Kissinger, had ever been read by President Nixon in full. Tom also felt, as he
                    reiterates in his own Oral History, that McCloy had not fought hard enough to
                    win this critical battle with the Pentagon on MIRVs, a weakness to which he
                    attributes the somewhat earlier resignation of Douglas Dillon from the GAC. In
                    short he felt he had done all he could, and that it was time to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you share this view when you took over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: My view was that the battle wasn't over till it was over; that this
                    exceptionally high-level group was clearly willing to work hard on these vital
                    issues; and that, besides endorsing general positions, it was essential that the
                    GAC stay on top of the evolving details, if its advice was to be taken
                    seriously.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the GAC do this in practice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: We continued to meet at least once a month in one of State's conference
                    rooms over a first-rate catered lunch - I thought this was important to give the
                    members the sense that the Government appreciated their service and cared - to
                    hear senior witnesses on political, strategic or technical aspects of the major
                    issues arms control issues.</p>
                <p>To give you a sense of the level and quality of these discussions, the perhaps
                    hundred-some witnesses I invited during my tenure included Henry Kissinger, the
                    then Deputy Secretaries of State and Defense, the Chairman of the JCS, the
                    service chiefs, the head of ACDA, uniformed and civilian senior managers of and
                    experts on relevant weapons systems such as the Admirals in charge of our
                    Trident submarine fleet, senior intelligence experts on Soviet programs, the
                    President's Science Advisor, heads of major nuclear and other research centers,
                    low-level experts on some particular, but important technical issue, as well as
                    Sovietologists, European and Far Eastern Experts and other analysts to help put
                    the advice we were given in context. Since all the Committee members were fully
                    cleared, much of the governmental testimony was at the Top Secret level and
                    above, including a great deal based on compartmentalized programs or
                    intelligence.</p>
                <p>What was remarkable was that our high-level, busy members attended these
                    Washington meetings most conscientiously and worked hard at what for many of
                    them were rather esoteric issues. Usually McCloy would open with a few remarks,
                    then invite our witness to lead off on the assigned subject, he himself seeming
                    to withdraw into what sometimes looked like a little nap, a deceptive habit he
                    had which witnesses underestimated at their peril. After a sometimes too long,
                    or unclear disquisition he would snap his head up, and in a few lucid sentences
                    summarize what had been said and then ask a question which went directly to the
                    heart of the matter.</p>
                <p>Although in his middle-seventies, a bit bent and often tired from incessant work
                    and travel, he was deeply committed to this work and convinced of the importance
                    of getting it right before we gave advice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you organize the meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: For each Committee meeting - they were usually focused on one or two
                    major themes, I would prepare a briefing book for Mr. McCloy and each member,
                    outlining the issues, providing background on the witnesses, and suggesting key
                    questions which could usefully be raised. In this and the many logistical
                    arrangements with which we were constantly faced, I was greatly helped by Norman
                    Terrell, a very competent mid-level FSO and, after his departure, by Richard
                    Gookin, who later became the State Department's Deputy Chief of Protocol.</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>Normally I would go over all this with Mr. McCloy before the meeting, he usually
                    came down from New York the night before and often stayed at the Metropolitan
                    Club, where we frequently met over a simple supper, and only rarely found that
                    he wanted to make major changes. We would usually meet again after the meetings
                    to discuss how things had gone and what the next step in the preparation of the
                    argument should be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any of these meetings particularly memorable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: They were all fascinating, although my first one was most poignant
                    because it occurred only a few days after our daughter Christina was born at
                    Women's' Hospital in Washington on April 21, 1971. We were in the last, rather
                    tense, stages of finalizing agenda, briefing papers etc., when Pat decided the
                    moment had come. So I spent the balance of that day reviewing and signing out a
                    stream of highly classified drafts brought by my staff to the maternity ward, to
                    the great puzzlement of doctors and nurses! Pat forgave me, I think, and
                    understood. As for Christina, she has been the joy of our lives and is now
                    herself the mother of lovely, lively twins, Magnus and Henry Tyson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a wonderful vignette, which underscores the human
                        dimension of all this policy stuff. Now getting back to the GAC, how
                        frequently did the Committee offer its advice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: My recollection is that we prepared and sent letters to President Nixon
                    and our other principals three or four times a year, sometimes on key issues in
                    the SALT negotiations, sometimes on ABM and MIRVs, sometimes on still other
                    matters like MBFR, the test ban issues or chemical/biological weapons.</p>
                <p>I would normally prepare a draft based on my understanding on where the group's
                    consensus was, push the envelope a bit to see if stragglers could be prevailed
                    on to get on board, review the text with Mr. Cloy and, after incorporating any
                    changes, submit the draft for Committee discussion and approval.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the front line SALT negotiators draw on what your
                        committee was doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: There was no direct relationship, since the Committee's advice was
                    provided only to the President, the Secretary of State, as well as the director
                    of ACDA. ACDA undoubtedly took note of the Committee's views and may have been
                    either encouraged or influenced by some of them. Everyone involved at the time
                    recognized that the GAC were a serious, independent, but fully informed group of
                    unusually experienced and influential people.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we talk a bit more about the specific issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The SALT issues took up a great deal of the Committee's time, and dealt
                    with problems like the inclusion or exclusion of nuclear missile submarines, the
                    relations between total numbers of land and sea-launched missiles, the possible
                    qualitative restraints which would assure that heavier or more modern missiles
                    would not replace the older ones the SALT I agreement proposed to limit, the
                    inclusion or exclusion of mobile missile systems, and most importantly the
                    questions of reliable verification.</p>
                <p>Other discussions focused on the implications for strategic stability of putting
                    MIRVs (Multiple Independently Targetable Reentry Vehicle) warheads on our ICBMs
                    (Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles), and the proposal to include an ABM
                    (Antiballistic Missile) agreement, which would, in effect, prohibit the
                    deployment of defensive missile systems—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The same one we're arguing about still?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The very same. We considered both of these questions from every
                    conceivable point of view.</p>
                <p>I remember long and detailed discussions about the feasibility of deploying an
                    effective antiballistic missile system, the vexing technical problems posed by
                    phased array radars, the problems posed by decoys and ways of banning ABMs while
                    still safeguarding the nations' most critical sites - an issue raised by the
                    fact that the Soviets were not willing to give up their not very effective
                    Moscow anti-missile complex. Throughout these far-ranging explorations the
                    Committee sustained its collective view that both an ABM agreement and a MIRV
                    ban were essential, since either or both ABM and MIRV deployment would
                    dramatically drive and so destabilize the arms race.</p>
                <p>The committee also spent considerable time on the question of how one might best
                    curb the underground testing of nuclear weapons, which at that time had already
                    become a very important question. While we did not reach as firm a conclusion on
                    this as we did on other issues, the committee, generally speaking, concluded
                    that curbing underground testing was important, and that even the then-existing
                    safeguards would probably be sufficient to make for a quite reliable
                    verification system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is being able to detect anybody else's surreptitious
                        testing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, the meteorological systems and geological detection systems, which
                    could be put in place, to do this.</p>

                <p>JAEGER: Yes, McCloy had pressed again and again for a meeting and finally
                    succeeded, probably because the White House, where these issues were overseen by
                    William Hyland and Helmut Sonnenfeldt, wanted the Committee's endorsement for
                    whatever emerged from the SALT negotiations then approaching their end
                    phase.</p>
                <p>The meeting took place in the Cabinet Room on March 21, 1972 and started with a
                    minor incident as the members filed in, followed by Mr. McCloy and myself.
                    Sonnenfeldt stepped in front of me and said I was not invited. McCloy turned and
                    told Hal, who had known me for years, that he wanted me to come, took me by the
                    arm and led me in. Hal, who served as note taker at the meeting was visibly
                    annoyed but clearly not ready to take on McCloy. I report this because it was a
                    small indicator of the extent to which the Nixon White House distrusted the
                    State Department and ACDA and wanted us kept out and in the dark.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the meeting go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, after this little contretemps, there we were in the cabinet room, I
                    in the second row directly behind McCloy who sat across the table from the
                    President, with the other members of the committee grouped around. The event was
                    memorialized in a photo, which was reprinted in ACDA's 12th Annual Report to
                    Congress for 1972.</p>
                <p>McCloy opened with a pithy summary of the GAC's views on the major issues, along
                    lines we had previously sent to the White House. Everything went well in the
                    ensuing discussion of SALT, because the Committee's position and specific
                    suggestions were very close to the Administration's at that point. McCloy also
                    made it clear that we were very vigorously opposed to American deployment of
                    antiballistic missile systems and very supportive of the notion of the ongoing
                    negotiation of an antiballistic missile treaty.</p>
                <p>The trouble started when McCloy told Nixon that we were also deeply concerned
                    about the possibility that the United States might go forward with MIRVing its
                    ballistic missiles, on the grounds that this would inevitably accelerate the
                    arms race and make arms control a great deal more difficult in spite of SALT,
                    and that in our view our deterrent was more than sufficient.</p>
                <p>Nixon, slouching a bit in his chair, had up to this point been friendly and
                    outgoing, listening with apparent interest and asking only occasional questions.
                    However he became visibly disturbed when McCloy summarized the Committee's
                    strong position against MIRVing. In itself this was not a surprise, given
                    Kissinger's long opposition to a MIRV ban.</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>What was surprising was Nixon's blunt and emotional reaction: “God damn it,
                    Jack!” He said, “I can take one of these toys away from the military, but I
                    can't take them all away. So if you don't want us to have ABMs, I've got to
                    leave them with at least the MIRVs!” Then, looking at these very distinguished
                    people sitting around the table, he said, “Anyway, do all of you really agree
                    with Jack (McCloy) on this?”</p>
                <p>This impugned McCloy's integrity. He reared half-way up out of his chair, and,
                    leaning powerfully forward across the cabinet table said to Nixon, “Mr.
                    President, I've advised Presidents for over 20 years and have served seven of
                    them. Not one of them has ever questioned my word.” The President looked around,
                    and said, “Well, what do you fellows think? Are you all with Jack?” The response
                    was clear and unanimous. The Committee's advice was to ban MIRVs.</p>
                <p>And thus, rather unhappily, we left.</p>
                <p>Needless to say the Moscow Summit two months later produced SALT I, 'The Interim
                    Agreement with respect to the Limitation of Offensive Arms', and an ABM Treaty -
                    but not a MIRV ban. As the GAC had predicted, and Bill Hyland, one of
                    Kissinger's senior staffers admitted years later, the result was an explosion in
                    the numbers of US warheads, which increased from 1700 in 1972 to over 10,000 in
                    the 1980's, with similar increases on the Soviet side: A dangerous and vastly
                    expensive exercise in overkill which could and should have been avoided.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever find out why they were so opposed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Only much later, as the official records of the time came to leak out.
                    Indeed, its now clear that, as Tom Fina had concluded, the game, as far as a
                    MIRV ban was concerned, was over well before Tom had left the Committee and that
                    our continuing hope of influencing Nixon through well-reasoned arguments was, in
                    retrospect, naive.</p>
                <p>In that sense our meeting with the President was a charade. Still, we didn't know
                    that at the time, and would have been profoundly derelict had we not tried.</p>
                <p>The story, as it has later emerged is actually much worse, because, in his
                    compulsive need to control events, Kissinger had deceived everybody, the senior
                    staff at ACDA, the Secretary of State, Gerry Smith and his negotiating team in
                    Helsinki, and even, at certain points, Nixon himself - by negotiating much of
                    the substance of the Moscow Summit agreements with Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin
                    and others in complex back channel operations, which at various points were
                    difficult to reconcile with the overt negotiations.</p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>Indeed the spider web was even more extensive, since these back channel deals
                    also included key issues in the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, being
                    simultaneously negotiated by Ambassador Rush and Jock Dean in Bonn. The best
                    account of what really happened, as far as I am aware, can be found in Walter
                    Isaacson's 1992 biography of Kissinger, published by Simon and Schuster.
                    Although it ignores the GAC's role as a bit player in this drama, it offers a
                    scathing account of Kissinger's maneuvering, whose main purpose seemed to be to
                    cut out all other players, particularly the State Department, and to keep all
                    the strings in his own hands.</p>
                <p>e. The final year</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did McCloy stay on after that meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The Committee continued to function until February 1973, when McCloy and
                    all the members submitted their resignations in view of the upcoming election.
                    In the meantime McCloy felt strongly that, regardless of the setback on the MIRV
                    issues, there remained other major arms control questions in play, especially
                    SALT II and MBFR on which it was important that the Committee stay informed and
                    offer its advice. So we continued our work until it was time to wind up.</p>
                <p>For me that meant foregoing a planned assignment to the Imperial Defense College
                    in London, although I was subsequently selected to attend the National War
                    College class of 1974, a ten month course which began that fall.</p>
                <p>f. The General Advisory Committee's records.</p>
                <p>JAEGER: After McCloy and the GAC's members had all left, it remained to decide
                    what to do with the Committee's extensive, highly classified verbatim
                    stenographic records, since each of its sessions had been carefully recorded
                    from the outset. I decided that this constituted an important historic resource
                    for future historians, who will want to know what a whole range of key players
                    of the period thought on the strategic issues of this time.</p>
                <p>I therefore arranged to have the records transcribed to microfiche and personally
                    took the two boxes of Codeword Top Secret records to the National Archives where
                    they can be found in Record Group 383.3 'Records of the General Advisory
                    Committee for Arms Control and Disarmament' 1969-1972 (39 rolls of microfilm)
                    under the 'Records of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency'.</p>
                <p>I hope someone will someday have them declassified and use them as the basis, for
                    what could be a very fascinating book.</p>
                <p>g. Working with McCloy.</p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a bit more about working with McCloy, what was it
                        like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: In retrospect, the greatest benefit of these two and a half years was my
                    unique relationship with Mr. McCloy. Although substantial, he was not a large or
                    imposing man, and, met on the street on in a hallway, would not have left anyone
                    with the sense that they had just encountered a formerly all-powerful High
                    Commissioner in Germany, a former President of the World Bank, or the most
                    distinguished partner of the New York law firm of Milbank Tweed, who was
                    President of the Council on Foreign Relations and widely acknowledged to be the
                    cornerstone of the 'East Coast Establishment'.</p>
                <p>He would lope along, wearing a battered old hat and a much-used gabardine rain
                    coat, carrying a large worn leather brief- case; ate sparingly and simply; and,
                    although always busy with multiple commitments, lived fully in the moment. I was
                    always amazed at his capacity to notice and relate to the people who made up the
                    supporting cast of his complex life, from the doorman or cigar counter attendant
                    at the Metropolitan Club to the world's mighty and famous, most of whom he knew;
                    and over his willingness to consider, not only the critically important issues
                    but also much that was ordinary and mundane. McCloy was of course a powerhouse.
                    But he was also a thoughtful, kindly man, deeply attached to his wife and
                    family, his now faded world and his country.</p>
                <p>As to our meetings, he more than paid his dues physically and intellectually
                    because of the great importance he attached to the issues involved. But he also
                    enjoyed the camaraderie of being with the members, with each of whom he
                    maintained differentiated but always cordial relationships. After all, they too,
                    with one or two exceptions, were part the Establishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did McCloy sometimes talk about his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Sometimes, after a long day of Committee meetings, he would sit in his
                    semi-darkened office, go over the days events or other major issues, doodle on a
                    yellow pad and reminisce. At other times he would ask me to come along with him
                    for supper.</p>
                <p>I learned in these conversations that, unlike most of his friends, he did not
                    start life with a silver spoon but was born on the poor side of the track and
                    worked his way up. He believed in giving full measure, loyal service, and honest
                    advice, regardless of which way the wind was blowing. While he and most of his
                    friends were old-fashioned 'liberal' Republicans, he was not partisan but judged
                    people and issues on their merits.</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>Ultimately, McCloy was a deeply committed patriot, dedicated to serving the vital
                    interests of our country regardless of the party or President in power. He was
                    not perfect, sometimes had strong preconceptions and clearly made some
                    misjudgments during his long career. Even so, they were the errors of a great
                    man, trying to do what he thought was best for our nation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There has been criticism, for instance, about McCloy's
                        resistance during the war to bombing the Auschwitz concentration camp. Did
                        he ever mention that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, we discussed that. Contrary to claims that he was indifferent to the
                    fate of the Jews McCloy expressed great compassion for the victims of the Hitler
                    regime, but maintained the view that for military reasons this would have been
                    an unsound use of American air power.</p>
                <p>The argument was that heavy bombers would have had to be used, that they could
                    not be spared from critical wartime missions, that the attrition rate would have
                    been high, and that many inmates would also have been killed.</p>
                <p>Even so, I think the record on this is not in McCloy's favor, since raids were
                    undertaken to near-by targets, and his biographer, Kai Bird, argues convincingly
                    that he never adequately immersed himself in the horrible realities involved.
                    Whatever one may say, his refusal to bomb Auschwitz was probably more a matter
                    of his sense of military priorities, mistaken as that may have been, than a
                    reflection of insensitivity to what was later to be called the holocaust.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of Kai Bird's biography, what do you think of
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Its a fair and detailed account, from which McCloy emerges pretty much as
                    I knew him during these two and a half years. Bird mentions the GAC and explains
                    Kissinger's 1970 decision to go ahead with MIRVing against McCloy's and the
                    GAC's advice, as well as McCloy's difficulties with Kissinger and his staff. And
                    he sets these issues in the context of McCloy's involvement, throughout his
                    seventies and into his eighties, of a broad range of other major public
                    issues.</p>
                <p>Still, its a pity that, to the best of my knowledge, neither Tom Fina nor I were
                    interviewed by Kai Bird to talk about the arms control part of McCloy's later
                    life, which remained a passionate commitment well into his advanced years.</p>

                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>JAEGER: He was physically burdened, walked leaning forward, and sometimes napped
                    in his office, occasionally visibly exhausted, Even so, throughout this period,
                    he insisted on coming to Washington as often as he could manage and continued to
                    work on major issues in his law firm as well, almost to the end. The only
                    concession he allowed himself towards the latter part of our work together, was
                    that he often had me come up to New York to bring him draft papers and the
                    latest top secret intelligence at his corner office high up in the Chase
                    building, rather than make an extra trip to Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean you had to take all this highly classified stuff

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. I was given an official ACDA courier's license and would fly to New
                    York with a briefcase full of probably the most top-secret papers in the U.S.
                    government.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: All went well, until one day when I took a cab at La Guardia, which, in a
                    congested intersection just beyond the Brooklyn Bridge, crashed into another
                    car. It was pure chance that we weren't injured and that this briefcase full of
                    Washington's crown jewels wasn't found by God-knows-who on the streets of New
                    York. I'm afraid I put duty first, jumped out and, leaving a 10 buck consolation
                    prize on the back seat, left the cabbie to deal with the police, disappeared
                    into the crowd with my briefcase and made it to the Chase building without
                    further incident.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did McCloy write you a nice report before you left?</hi>

                <p>JAEGER: Its funny you should ask. When the issue came up after my first year he
                    wrote me an efficiency report which was three sentences long; something to the
                    effect, “Jaeger is a very good man. He's one of the best Foreign Service
                    Officers I have worked with. He should be promoted.” Signed McCloy.</p>

                <p>JAEGER: This, of course, is not in the Foreign Service tradition, which requires
                    lengthy efficiency reports on a complicated form. So I went into his office and
                    said, “Mr. Chairman, I am most appreciative of this very kind report, but, the
                    trouble is that it isn't going to do anything for me in the Foreign Service.” He
                    said, “What's the matter? I said you should be promoted, and you're doing a
                    great job here!” I tried to explain. But McCloy , who could be very stubborn,
                    wouldn't budge: “Well, you tell them I am John Jay McCloy, and that's what I
                    think!” As it was, Phil Farley, the Deputy Director of ACDA wrote a very helpful
                    covering memo. And since I had just ben promoted to FSO-3 in 1971, all this was
                    important but not crucial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The next year, and then for my final report, McCloy still refused to use
                    the forms but dictated wonderfully blunt, detailed memoranda describing our long
                    work together in warm and generous terms and urged my promotion to FSO-2. Phil
                    Farley again supplemented them with covering notes giving me a good share of the
                    credit for helping to guide the Committee through the great complexities of the
                    arms control issues and being the principal drafter of the Committee's
                    recommendations to the President.</p>
                <p>In retrospect these were rich and privileged years. It was exciting to play a bit
                    part in the great battle over arms control. But the best part was serving a man
                    who, for all his foibles and faults, embodied much that was best in our culture
                    and ideals. He himself put it best in his reply to praise showered on him at a
                    star-studded dinner on his 90th birthday at the Council on Foreign Relations.
                    “In know', he said,” that many of the things said tonight were exaggerated, but
                    they made me feel warm. My record has its pluses and minuses. I only hope that
                    it has been credible, that people can say of me: He did his damnedest, the
                    angels can do no more.”</p>
                <p>That's what he was all about. When McCloy died in 1989 an era came to end.</p>
                <p>2.National War College Class of 1974</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you were off to the War College in the fall of
                        1973. How do they choose who gets to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Like all personnel processes that's a bit of mystery. I suppose they pick
                    the best people available between regular assignments and send some to the
                    Senior Seminar, which in State is the most prestigious, some to Universities and
                    places like the Imperial Defense College in London, where I most wanted to go,
                    and 20 or 25 to the War College at Fort Leslie McNair in Washington. In any case
                    its a assignment most people welcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the size of the class and how was it
                        composed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I don't know how it is now, but our class numbered about 145, with the
                    great majority, I would guess 100, coming from the uniformed services. Most of
                    them were Lt. Colonels or Navy Commanders, although there were a few Colonels
                    and Navy Captains, all chosen because they were considered potential General
                    officer material. The civilian component was much smaller, 35 or so, with the
                    majority from State, mostly senior FSO-3's. The rest came from the CIA and other
                    unmentionable places, including, in our class, the very first War College
                    Student from the FBI. Hoover had taken the position that the War College was
                    much too liberal and that his FBI officers might get subverted by it. So our FBI
                    classmate, who had been on the FBI's Soviet Embassy surveillance staff, was sort
                    of a trial balloon. We came to know each other a bit and he was just delighted
                    to have this chance to breathe some fresh air - although he confided at one
                    point that he would still have to keep a low profile so as not to 'screw things
                    up' for others after him!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was after Hoover had left the scene?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. The year after Hoover left in 1972.</p>
                <p>a. McCain and the other seven officer POWs from the Hanoi Hilton.</p>
                <p>JAEGER: The really special thing about our class were the seven officer POWs who
                    had just been released by the North Vietnamese in February 1973, the most famous
                    of whom was John McCain, later Senator and Presidential Candidate. Another was
                    Captain William Lawrence, who was clearly the wisest and most respected among
                    our returning POWs. He later became Commander of the Third Pacific Fleet and
                    Commandant of the Naval Academy,</p>
                <p>All seven had been sent to the War College for a year of recuperation before
                    resuming military careers. It was a sobering experience to watch them during the
                    first weeks and months, unsure, introverted, somewhat confused, trying to get
                    over their physical and emotional hurts and struggling to work and live their
                    way back into a world which had changed since they were captured years earlier.
                    Some of them returned to find their wives had remarried, others that old
                    affections were difficult to revive. It was all human drama at close range.</p>
                <p>The heartening and exciting thing for the rest of us was to gradually see them
                    recover their health and self-confidence as the year went along and watch most
                    of them become active, indeed first-rate participants. Initially McCain seemed
                    rather shaken and seemed glad to have some of us help a bit with term papers and
                    other stuff. But he participated from the outset, worked hard at PT and sports,
                    and gradually recovered his spark. Although friendly and thoughtful, he could be
                    brusque, and probably hoped even then that there was still a significant future
                    awaiting him.</p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>How significant would probably have surprised him, since he was at that point not
                    one of the outstanding people in our class. What I think he wanted was to just
                    get back in the game and perhaps, with luck, make Admiral. For John, then and
                    now, was above anything else the son and grandson of Admirals, who had to live
                    up to a great tradition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to know any of the other former POWs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Not all of them, but some. The one who was perhaps most remarkable was
                    Air Force Col. Fred Cherry, the only black among the seven former POWs at the
                    War College, who probably had been abused and tortured more than any of the
                    others at the 'Hilton'. He was in painful therapy much of the year and perhaps
                    had the hardest time of all of them.</p>
                <p>Then a remarkable thing happened unexpectedly. A black nurse/therapist, I think
                    from Florida, had read about him in the papers and, out of the blue, offered to
                    come up to Washington to take care of him. She did, and she did absolute
                    wonders. My last recollection of them was at our class's graduation ball, when
                    these two people, he no longer the suffering invalid but an elegant military
                    figure in his dress uniform and she radiant with pride and joy in her white ball
                    gown, waltzed magically at the center of the floor while all of us simply stood
                    around, full of gladness and admiration. I hope they had a rich and rewarding
                    life together.</p>
                <p>The Vietnam war, as far as further offensive action was concerned, had ended in
                    January 1973, and most of the POWs were released in February. The presence of
                    seven of them, as well as of many others who had fought at one time or another
                    in that pointless conflict, distinguished our class and, I think, made it wiser
                    and more mature.</p>
                <p>b. Mixing civilians and military officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did mixing of civilian and military officers work out?
                        Isn't there usually a lot of cultural tension and misunderstanding between
                        the civilians and their military counterparts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The War College's approach of mixing civilian and military field
                    grade-level officers, which I think is an approach George Kennan introduced
                    years earlier to overcome these cultural cross-currents, was a real success.</p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>Early in the year the civilians tended to be the more prominent. They were
                    generally better informed on world affairs, better able to articulate, more
                    confident in raising questions and clearly had an easier time writing papers.
                    The military, in most cases, were less verbal and, initially at least, had a
                    harder time expressing nuanced views, tending to see issues in black or white
                    terms, you either do or you don't. There was also an initial difference in basic
                    attitudes, the military, as you would expect, tending to be more conservative
                    while the civilians were clearly the more liberal.</p>
                <p>The fascinating thing was that, as the year progressed, and apparently this has
                    been an annual pattern, some of these initial distinctions tended to blur and in
                    some cases reverse, as the two groups came to understand and learn from each
                    other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you illustrate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I remember a sandwich lunch four or five of us had one day. I don't
                    remember the fellow's name, but there was a guy sitting next to me who had
                    hardly said anything for the first six weeks or so. When we asked him at one
                    point about his war, he explained that he had been a squadron commander in
                    Vietnam and described in plain, soul-wrenching terms what it was like to lead a
                    squadron into a wall - the term he used - of antiaircraft fire, what it was like
                    to lose people, and the tremendous responsibility and stress he had felt in
                    commanding raids which were supposed to be successful, while trying not to get
                    people killed who were his closest comrades and friends. Writing memos at State
                    seemed a lot easier from then on by comparison.</p>
                <p>I remember another conversation with a fellow student who had been in charge of
                    the flight deck of an aircraft carrier in the Pacific which brought home to a
                    number of us the tremendous management skills this sort of job required,
                    involving responsibility for the safety, security continuing direction of
                    hundreds of people and of many millions worth of equipment. It was in its own
                    way awesome.</p>
                <p>In short we civilians learned how much strategic and technical knowledge,
                    courage, skill, bravery and dedication our military colleagues brought to the
                    table. They, for their part, learned, I think, that we were not just glib pencil
                    pushers in cushy jobs, but were just as deeply concerned for our country's
                    national interest, who brought different skills to bear. So we learned as much,
                    if not more, from each other than from the official program the War College
                    offered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this change people's attitudes?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. By year's end the roles of the two groups had almost reversed - the
                    civilians had become more conservative, more aware of strategic considerations
                    and the role and management of military power in national decision-making;
                    whereas the military seemed to have a much greater appreciation of the
                    political, economic and historic contexts in which great issues play out on the
                    international stage, had become more 'liberal' and were less inclined to see the
                    world as a zero-sum game.</p>
                <p>As a result, we, as others before us, left with the hope that we could help
                    mitigate the cultural gulf between the military and civilian parts of our
                    government, partly by maintaining informal channels with each other as we
                    returned to our respective careers for solving the intractable civilian/military
                    issues which regularly arise. Sometimes this has actually helped.</p>
                <p>c.. The Program</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting and at somewhat encouraging. Could we
                        now talk a bit about the content and format of the official War College
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, it essentially consisted of twice-daily lectures in an
                    upward-sloping auditorium, so that people could look down on the speaker in the
                    pit below. The lectures focused first on the organization of the government's
                    national security universe, and the many issues this poses; then on the major
                    strategic and arms control questions facing the United States; and lastly on the
                    many evolving regional, functional, and bilateral issues which define the
                    context in which the US pursues its short and longer-term interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How good were these presentations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Some of them were routine, bureaucratic yawners, designed to protect the
                    briefer rather than illuminate the subject. But the majority were interesting
                    and sometimes highly instructive, since the War College often succeeded in
                    getting first-rate people from the academic, diplomatic, military, intelligence
                    and executive worlds to talk to us. I can't reconstruct a list of them, but they
                    ranged from members of the Joint Chiefs, to White House and senior State
                    Department officials, to all sorts of famous experts on everything from the
                    Soviet Union to African development.</p>
                <p>After their lectures, there would be an extended question-and-answer-period, in
                    which we were expected to question these people in depth, challenge their
                    conclusions and produce our own ideas. Often these discussions which followed
                    the lectures were as probing and interesting, if not better, than the actual
                    lectures themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any central themes or threads which tied it all
                        together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: 1973/74 was a time of profound transition. Vietnam was over, the Nixon
                    Presidency was rapidly waning - he came to the War College in April '74 for a
                    tub thumping speech defending his record on Vietnam; relations had been opened
                    with Beijing; and detente and major arms control initiatives were beginning to
                    change the strategic context, as well as our relations with the USSR - with
                    corollary implications for Germany, NATO and our other alliances. In the Middle
                    East the Yom Kippur War of October 1973 created new tensions as well as
                    opportunities. In short, the central theme was that the world was changing fast,
                    and that the US needed to rethink assumptions and find a new balance in foreign
                    and military policies.</p>
                <p>d. The Middle East trip</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The War College used to end its year with a three or four
                        week trip to some part of the world. Did you get to go on one of these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, that was by far the most exciting part of the experience. To flesh
                    out lectures and reading with some actual experience, the Pentagon provided four
                    aircraft - they still had money for that sort of thing in those days - and a
                    general officer to lead us on a month's trip of our choice around key areas in
                    Latin America, the Far East, Europe or the Middle East. A War College faculty
                    expert spent several preceding months making the many arrangements and
                    high-level appointments necessary with the help of our Embassies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which did you choose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The Middle East, because I knew least about it. That turned out to be a
                    brilliant choice, because the program was spectacular. We started in Israel and
                    then went to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and
                    finally to Egypt and, and American prestige being near its apogee, were received
                    at the highest levels throughout.</p>
                <p>i. Golda in Israel</p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>For example, in Israel we had a two-hour session with Golda Meir , who turned up
                    dragging her famous carpetbag, looking, in her shapeless print dress, like a
                    stereotypical Jewish mother-in-law of the early 'fifties. She sat down at a
                    simple desk, chain smoked, and gave us a tough but thoughtful and surprisingly
                    balanced overview of the problems Israel faced in those days as she perceived
                    them. We also met with Moshe Dayan, brilliant, civilized and British in his
                    inflections; some Israeli generals who explained the tactics of the Yom Kippur
                    war; and were taken on a field trip to Nablus in the West bank, bristling with
                    Israeli military positions, where some Army people tried to persuade us how well
                    Palestinians were being treated. Still, senior Israeli officials, while
                    passionate about the survival of Israel, seemed more nuanced in their thinking
                    than recent ideological hard liners like Benjamin Netanyahu - even though they
                    had just been through the '73 war.</p>
                <p>ii.Old students in Jordan</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: After three days in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv we made a stop in Amman. With
                    'special permission' from both countries we had been allowed to drive across the
                    Allenby Bridge and were welcomed in a pleasant, verdant valley near the border
                    by a Jordanian military unit, which welcomed us with a splendid al fresco lunch
                    - a traditional 'lamb-pull' served on large braziers covered with rice and
                    roasted lamb.</p>
                <p>We all stood around, dug in with our right hands as we had been told, and enjoyed
                    the warmth of this genuinely friendly welcome. Then a fairly senior Jordanian
                    officer, with whom I had been talking, asked me if I would honor him by
                    accepting a cup of Jordan's 'special drink'? I said, of course, and was served a
                    cup of lukewarm somewhat curdled yogurt, which still smelled a bit of barn, in
                    the center of which floated a large lamb's eye! Our leader, the Rear Admiral,
                    and my War College classmates watched intently to see whether I was up to it. So
                    I closed my eyes, slurped mightily and got most of it down, including the
                    glaring eye! Everybody cheered, including the Jordanians. I had passed.</p>
                <p>Then it was on to Amman, still a medium-sized, largely Arab town clustered around
                    the Roman amphitheater - not yet the attractive modern city it has become. There
                    were visits to an Arab legion base, technical military briefings which
                    de-emphasized Jordan's role on the Syrian front in the Yom Kippur war, and a
                    warm, friendly reception by King Hussein. None of it was very illuminating about
                    what had been, or was, going on in the Middle East, but fascinating for all
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>For me the most startling experience was our group's meeting with Prime Minister
                    Zaid al-Rifai, the scion of a powerful Jordanian political dynasty, who, patient
                    readers of this text will remember, had years earlier been my tutee at Adams
                    House at Harvard - and had then asked me the central question facing modernizing
                    Moslems in this secular age, whether Allah existed. I had decided that I should
                    not exploit my previous contact with him and was sitting in the back of this
                    large meeting, at which he was flanked by several of his ministers.</p>
                <p>Even so, Zaid had somehow learned that I was there, and, to the mystification of
                    my classmates and Tom Pickering, the American Ambassador, began his speech by
                    saying how “difficult it was for him to rise and speak before his teacher!”
                    Everybody in the room looked around until it gradually it became clear whom he
                    was talking about. It was his way of saying thank you.</p>
                <p>Decades later, after I had retired, my wife Pat and I were his dinner guests at
                    his striking family compound in Amman. He showed me an inscribed book I had once
                    given him at Adams House, which he had kept in his library all these years, and
                    again, before his large assembled family, expressed his thanks before launching
                    into a broader conversation illustrating the difficulty of Jordan's balancing
                    act between the US, Israel, the Palestinians and all the other forces in the
                    Middle East.</p>
                <p>iii. To Riyadh to meet the King</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Jordan Saudi Arabia was quite a change of pace?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, it was actually a shock. Far from the moneyed capital it is today,
                    Riyadh in 1974 was still an austere, sand colored little city set in the middle
                    of the vast Arabian desert, dominated by a water tower; a place where the
                    religious police cruised the streets; and where a woman had been stoned to death
                    in a plastic bag for adultery only a week before our arrival! Although a few
                    lavish palaces were beginning to appear on the outskirts, our hotel was a badly
                    maintained relic of the 1920's with a pervasive toilet smell. Some said it was
                    reserved for infidels.</p>
                <p>Be that as it may, it was our first encounter with Wahhabism and the stricter
                    versions of Islam. There were the predictable lectures by our Ambassador and
                    others on oil, Saudi Arabia's critical role in the Middle East, its efforts to
                    modernize, etc. But what stuck with me most was the haunting experience of
                    Arabia, that vast mysterious desert kingdom and its age-old tribes which I later
                    rediscovered in reading Lawrence's 'Pillars' and biographies of Gertrude
                    Bell.</p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>The high point, of course, was our meeting with King Faisal in a vast gilded
                    reception room in his palace. We were seated on chairs at one end, the king on
                    the other framed by a half dozen aged counselors, biblical-looking figures,
                    huddled closely behind and next to him. He gave a brief, rather vague speech
                    stressing the Kingdom's good relations with America and then invited questions.
                    I was one of the few who had the gumption to speak up and asked - in retrospect
                    very naively - how the Kingdom was spending its vast income to improve the lot
                    of its people. There was a long pause, the advisers whispered. More pause. Then
                    came the answer from the throne: “How the Kingdom spends its money is the
                    Kingdom's business!” I think the American Ambassador was not pleased.</p>
                <p>The Saudi military were more forthcoming and hospitable and offered us a
                    sumptuous 'lamb-pull' in a beautifully carpeted circular space high up in a
                    water tower which dramatically over-looked the city. It was a terrific party,
                    with all of us in the first row squatting on the carpet before the overflowing
                    braziers and eating to our hearts content. We gathered from our hosts that the
                    polite thing to do was to burp loudly when one had had enough and then to get up
                    to make room for the second and third rows of people waiting behind us for their
                    turns. When it came, they threw themselves on the remaining scraps with
                    memorable ferocity until there was literally nothing left.</p>
                <p>The dinner had a sequel, of which we learned just as we were leaving. King Faisal
                    had somehow heard about out, was outraged that someone had had the audacity to
                    dine in a place which looked down on the King's palace, and immediately ordered
                    the water tower's dining area closed!</p>
                <p>iv. India and Pakistan</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Its a pity you could spend only a few days. What happened
                        next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: We were off to India, then to Pakistan. We met defense ministers and some
                    military people in both countries, who talked cautiously of their recent
                    rapprochement, offered us starkly opposing views about Kashmir and made politely
                    sure that we understood their somewhat differentiated, in Pakistan's case
                    evolving, view of non-alignment.</p>
                <p>The real benefit came from getting a feel for these extraordinary countries,
                    where the layers of successive cultures reach back almost to the beginnings of
                    mankind; where human density is such that everything everywhere seems to move;
                    and where ones eyes are continually shocked by unexpected shapes and colors.</p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>Odd things made an impression. In Delhi, while waiting in some official's outer
                    office I was struck by the number of his secretaries. Actually he had only one,
                    but she needed a deputy, in case she was absent or sick, and both these ladies
                    were too high-ranking and skilled to allow them to put new ribbons in the
                    typewriter or to bring supplies or tea. So they needed an assistant, who in turn
                    needed another deputy - an obvious make-work program, particularly when
                    projected across every office in the country, which was rational only in a
                    nation's with India's massive oversupply of human beings.</p>
                <p>A related point was made by the poor man I found sitting on the door mat in front
                    of my elegant hotel room in New Delhi, who, when asked why he was there,
                    explained that it was possible I might need something at some time. He stayed
                    there day and night throughout our stay and seemed content when I gave him a few
                    rupees when we left. So we learned indirect lessons, about India's poverty,
                    caste structure and economic problems, as well as its yearning to become a
                    serious modern state which were given shape by briefings at the Embassy.</p>
                <p>There were also lighter moments, as when I resisted the temptation of buying a
                    cobra...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: .....on the way to the Taj Mahal and settled for a necklace of
                    semi-precious stones which my wife Pat still wears; and our excursion to the
                    Ambassador's weekend house in one of the former British hill stations, facing
                    the mighty, even higher ranges which are the foothills of the Himalayas.</p>
                <p>Our visit to Pakistan offered different perspectives. Besides the usual officials
                    we were received in his glittering office by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto
                    who told us his version of his country's complex recent history, talked about
                    his peace agreement with Indira Gandhi, the difficulties involved in his
                    recognition of Bangladesh, his nationalization of industry and land which he
                    wanted to redistribute to the poor, the ongoing tensions between Pakistan's
                    parties, and his recent approval of a new Constitution which, fatefully, made
                    Pakistan an Islamic Republic.</p>
                <p>In retrospect his was also the time when Pakistan started its nuclear program,
                    which greatly upset Washington. Needless to say we were unaware of this and
                    Bhutto did not mention it. I came away with the sense that Bhutto was aware that
                    he was doing a political high wire act likely to end badly. It did. He was
                    hanged, after what may well have been a rigged trial in 1979.</p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>Perhaps that's the real lesson we learned in Pakistan, that its essentially an
                    ungovernable country. The British thought they had it tamed, as the Victorian
                    parade grounds of Rawalpindi wistfully impy. Since becoming a separate state,
                    brief attempts at democracy have been succeeded by long episodes of military
                    rule. At this writing, Bhutto's daughter, trying to battle her way back to
                    power, has just encountered the same maelstrom of discordant forces and been
                    assassinated.</p>
                <p>One more recollection is perhaps worth recording. Before we left, the legendary,
                    still dashing Col. Byroade, who was then our Ambassador in Islamabad, offered us
                    a splendid afternoon reception to which he invited a cross section of Pakistan's
                    elite. It was held rather romantically under a vast rug canopy in the
                    residency's front yard, held up by a little forest of wooden poles, as is the
                    local custom, against the backdrop of the vast mountain chains framing
                    Islamabad.</p>
                <p>As the fashionable and important were mingling and a little army of white-clad
                    servers dispensed drinks and canap�s, a sharp breeze suddenly came down from the
                    foothills of the Himalayas. Without warning, the whole heavy structure, rug,
                    poles and all, came crashing down, leaving us all sprawled on the ground in
                    total darkness. Extracting oneself was not without peril as an English lady,
                    whom I had unintentionally encountered while groping forward, angrily made
                    clear. Eventually we all emerged, largely unscathed, but caked in red dust! No
                    group photographs were taken.</p>
                <p>v. Afghanistan</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am glad you survived! What happened next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: We left for Kabul and flew up the Khyber Pass at low altitude in our big,
                    four-motor Air Force plane. It was my turn to sit in the cockpit with the pilot,
                    which gave me a memorable close-up of this fought-over terrain and the turbaned
                    tribesmen making their way up or down the pass or sitting on rocks waving their
                    rifles and Kalashnikovs; a sight both out of Kipling's world and today's. When
                    we had crested the pass, the pilot put the plane in a gut- wrenching descent
                    down the other side and swept to a perfect landing in Kabul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Afghanistan like in 1974?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Two things stand out: The pervasive Soviet influence, most noticeable at
                    the military academy we visited, where we met all kinds of Russian-trained
                    instructors and heard briefings which emphasized the influence of the USSR; and
                    the diversity of this ancient poor, mountainous land which has defied effective
                    government and conquest.</p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>We were there only a year after Daud Khan had taken advantage of the King's
                    absence in Rome to take over the government at a time of rising Soviet
                    influence; after the US had declined to help with arms sales, lest they offend
                    Pakistan. The Soviets trained the military and built roads leading to the USRR.
                    The US, we heard from Ambassador Ted Eliot also built some roads but focused
                    mainly on health and agriculture, the latter an uphill fight at a time of
                    intense drought. The American community, lively and dedicated, also had active
                    outreach programs, including one to women in remote villages who made Afghan
                    products for eventually sale. All in all we found an air of modest optimism,
                    that somehow we and the Soviets could, with our competing efforts, somehow help
                    Afghanistan turn the corner. As we now know that was a forlorn hope.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a chance to see any of this for
                        yourselves?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Our program unfortunately was tightly scripted and didn't allow for field
                    trips or much sightseeing. My main recollection is Kabul itself - at the time a
                    modest-sized town with a lot of adobe-type buildings set in a vast dusty basin
                    surrounded by grey forbidding mountains.</p>
                <p>What most sticks in mind were Afghanistan's amazing people, the tough-looking men
                    with craggy, timeworn faces, large noses and dramatic eyes, topped by all sorts
                    of colorful headgear and turbans; the women, some in burqas, some not; almost
                    all, except for a small westernized upper crust, showing the effects of the
                    country's harsh and isolating mountainous environment, of age-old poverty,
                    endless wars and current drought. There were a few cars and trucks on the
                    streets, but many more camels, goats, dogs and push carts. It was a country just
                    beginning to take its first tentative steps into a more modern age.</p>
                <p>Sadly, western efforts at institution-building and promotion of human,
                    particularly women's, rights has been reversed by the Islamist fighters we armed
                    and supported to fight the Soviet occupation. While that enterprise succeeded,
                    the Taliban, now using modern weapons to resist 'unislamic' change, has in turn
                    become the central problem.</p>
                <p>But all that hadn't happened yet. On the contrary, I remember one afternoon
                    standing on the balcony of the Intercontinental Hotel, which sits on a hill,
                    which then overlooked a large flowering orchard. There were two young lovers
                    walking among the trees holding hands, a scene of sweetness and peace, as in a
                    Persian miniature, which has stayed with me through all these years.</p>
                <p>vi. Iran: A bubble ready to burst</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A fascinating kaleidoscope of impressions.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Our next stop, Tehran could not have been more different - a bustling
                    largely modern city, with huge traffic flows - to the extent that smog was
                    sometimes obscuring the Alborz mountains - many large modern buildings and a
                    clearly educated, sophisticated upper class.</p>
                <p>This was brought home to me at a reception in a wealthy suburban home, which was
                    as sophisticated and glamorous as anything one is likely to encounter in New
                    York or Paris. People were elegantly dressed, spoke English, French and other
                    languages, had studied in various major universities, had all sorts of
                    high-level professions, and, under the Shah's benevolent protection, clearly
                    enjoyed the good life - as long as they behaved themselves. It was equally
                    clear, however, simply by watching the human flow in the streets, that the
                    majority of Iranians, the many manual workers and particularly the peasants in
                    the country villages, were still, to varying degrees, living in an earlier,
                    simpler age, much less educated and still deeply attached to their age-old
                    Muslim faith.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to meet the Shah?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, that was one of the extraordinary things about this visit. The Shah
                    received us in a small ornate room in the palace, and spoke to us for two and a
                    half hours. He was an elegant, but diminutive man, slender with small feet, a
                    controlled and quietly assertive personality - surrounded by people clearly in
                    awe of him. While he himself tried to appear informal in a rather stiff sort of
                    way, his entourage made absolutely sure that royal protocol and decorum were
                    observed.</p>
                <p>The essence of the Shah's message was pure megalomania: That he was building a
                    new, modern Iran which would come to be seen as the “Prussia of the Middle
                    East”, would become the dominant power in the region in his lifetime and rival
                    the Persia of Cyrus the Great in magnificence and power. The rest was detail.
                    How he was building steel mills, subways, military power, improving health and
                    education and so on. Very little was said about Islam, which he clearly saw as
                    the great impediment to modernization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. An idealized return to the power pre-Muslim Persia.
                        What did he say on his relations with the US?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Predictably he had only kind words for President Nixon and Iran's US
                    relations. As we had learned at the Embassy, Nixon had assured him that he could
                    buy whatever military hardware he wanted [except atomic weapons]; a commitment
                    which ended the ambivalence which tended to prevail during the Johnson period
                    when the Shah, to Washington's annoyance, would go to the USSR whenever the US
                    would not sell him something. To pay for all this the Shah, of course, needed
                    high oil prices and control of his oil resources, all of which the US accepted
                    in return for his support of US interests in the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Shah's grand vision play elsewhere in Iran?
                        Any indicators?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Our meetings with other officials were mostly party-line elaborations,
                    partly because some were evidently afraid of doing otherwise. Even the Deputy
                    Defense Minister pointed to the ceiling, suggesting that there were microphones
                    there, while giving an obviously non-responsive answer to a challenging
                    question. The Shah's new Persia clearly depended on its secret police and
                    coercion to assure consent. But even this would soon prove inadequate to sustain
                    the regime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a sense of the tensions the country was
                        actually feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: We were there only a few days, but to me at least it became crystal clear
                    that Iran was straining at all levels to cope with the multiplicity of projects
                    the Shah wanted accomplished by an educated class of, if I remember correctly,
                    only eight percent of the population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you actually see any of these problems play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, most graphically during our visit to a helicopter base in Isfahan
                    where, to my absolute amazement, there were 500 helicopters, most of them parked
                    and baking in the burning sun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: American made?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. The briefer assured us that all these helicopters would soon be
                    flown and maintained by Iranians, and that the very expensive American mechanics
                    currently doing most of this would soon be replaced. Since this seemed a bit
                    sanguine, given the huge number of copters involved, I went outside where an
                    American mechanic was leaning against the door having a smoke. I said, “Look,
                    what's the real story here? What's going on?” He said, “It's a f***ing
                    disaster.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: He went on, “ The Shah promised us that there would be an adequate number
                    of educated, well-prepared young people to fly these choppers when he bought
                    them. When the first squadron arrived we got 20 or 30 youngsters who were
                    trainable. After that we got farm boys, who couldn't even do arithmetic and
                    don't have a clue about running or maintaining machinery, computers, or anything
                    of the kind. So we had to start from scratch, teaching them basics. That's a
                    slow, frustrating process.” In short, “most of these copters are not flyable,
                    because we don't have the people to fly them or maintain them, so they just sit
                    there in the sun.”</p>
                <p>I then asked, “How do people around here like this?” My mechanic friend, who had
                    been in Isfahan for some months, said, “Oh, it's creating enormous stress, since
                    everyone knows the Iranians aren't up to the job, feel put down and blame the
                    Shah for the whole mess.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But was this a unique situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Even though we were In Iran only a few days, we heard of other examples
                    in which great projects were, in effect, stuck, or in crisis, because of
                    inadequate human and material resources and needed high-priced foreign
                    technicians to do the job. Even so, the Shah was pushing for more and more,
                    rather than expanding the economy at an absorbable pace.</p>
                <p>The most telling, and I gather true, story illustrating his megalomania involved
                    the Shah's visit to an aircraft carrier battle group in the Indian Ocean. On the
                    bridge with the admiral watching the maneuvers, the Shah turned to him and
                    asked: “How much?” The admiral said, “Your majesty, you mean this aircraft
                    carrier?” The Shah said, “No, the whole thing, everything, your whole fleet
                    here.” The admiral, so the story goes, looked him in the eye and said, “Your
                    Majesty, the U.S. Navy is not yet for sale!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I can't swear to this story but it reflects the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two other questions? You have spoken of the Shah's
                        exorbitant ambition and the inability of Iran's population to do all that
                        was being asked of it. Didn't all this also threaten the underlying Islamic
                        culture of the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, of course, although the organizers of our visit were careful not to
                    let us meet anyone who would actually say so. There was another factor, the
                    yawning disparities in wealth between ordinary Iranians, particularly in the
                    countryside, and the opulence evident in the Shah's palaces and the very
                    comfortable life style of the upper classes. It was clear some people were
                    profiting very handsomely from Iran's meteoric economic expansion, while many
                    others were not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they understand all this at the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Let me tell you the story of our briefing by the Brigadier General in
                    charge of military sales to the Shah. He stressed that President Nixon had given
                    the Shah a letter saying, anything you want you get, and that our military
                    therefore plied him with hardware and sold him as much stuff as he wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: When it came to question period, I got up and said, “Well, General, we've
                    just been around the country and what is most obvious to some of us are the huge
                    stresses which seem to be developing as result of the Shah's too rapid
                    expansion. There isn't a large enough educated workforce to handle all the
                    projects. There are growing disparities in wealth and increasing tension between
                    the modernizers and the traditionalists. What limits are being put on this thing
                    to ensure that we don't end up with a revolution or a social breakdown in
                    Iran?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were right on the mark!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The general got very red in the face - I had obviously touched a raw
                    nerve - looked hard at me and said that he was “not aware of the fact that
                    Commies were now being admitted to the National War College.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was his answer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That was his answer. When we got back to Washington all this still
                    bothered me. So I decided to see the Iranian desk officer at State to tell him
                    of my concern over what I had seen in Iran and of our apparent blindness to the
                    potentially disastrous implications of pandering to the Shah's megalomania; a
                    feeding frenzy for Iran's oil money which in fairness had infected the French,
                    the Germans and others almost as much as the US.</p>
                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>The desk officer said something flattering to the effect that, for a four day
                    visit, I had certainly got right to the heart of the matter. He assured me that
                    he and others in the Department understood all this perfectly well, were very
                    concerned but powerless in view of the President's sweeping decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So a lot of people understood the risks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. I for one was not surprised when Iran finally blew up in
                    1979 and the Americans were kicked out. Almost forty years later we are still
                    paying the price for the Shah's and Nixon's folly and are now facing a
                    potentially even more disastrous and hostile situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would have taken just a little common sense to prevent
                        all this! How sad. Before we go on to Egypt, did you get to see anything of
                        the country in Iran besides officials and helicopters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Besides Tehran, which we have talked about, only Isfahan, which was still
                    breathtakingly beautiful. We stayed at the famous, then somewhat rundown, Shah
                    Abbas Hotel with its spectacular rose gardens, which is full of memories of
                    famous people who have spent time there. And I did have time to explore the
                    exquisite Shah mosque - renamed the Imam mosque since the revolution - with its
                    shimmering seven-colored and blue tiles, built by Shah Abbas in the early 17th
                    century. I also managed to wander around the back allies and streets of Isfahan
                    for a while, which gave me a chance to see what ordinary provincial life was
                    like. The contrast with upscale, busy Tehran was stark. Unfortunately it was a
                    very tightly scheduled, time-limited visit.</p>
                <p>vii. Finally Egypt and Sadat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Iran you went on to Egypt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, we flew to an air strip in the Egyptian desert, the first visit by
                    any official American group after the '73 Yom Kippur War. Anwar Sadat had
                    evidently decided to agree to this War College visit as a small step in the
                    process of restoring Egyptian-American relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before the American AID program to Egypt
                        recommenced?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. US aid was not resumed till 1975, after a seven year
                    hiatus, and did not reach major proportions until a short time after the
                    Israeli-Egyptian Peace Treaty was concluded in 1979, part of the deal for
                    Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Egyptian message during your visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Their thrust was that the Egyptian Army had really done well and would
                    have won the war if the Israelis had not received massive outside help; in
                    short, that this was not such a terrible defeat for Egypt. Be that as it may, it
                    was the psychological perception that they had not acquitted themselves too
                    badly which allowed Sadat to move so quickly toward a totally unprecedented
                    peace agreement with Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That really was a remarkable turnaround. Now tell us more
                        about your visit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, we were driven in open command cars across the desert to what
                    looked like a sand dune, which, when we got closer, turned out to have an
                    entrance under extensive camouflage netting. We were being taken to an Egyptian
                    underground military headquarters with all the amenities.</p>
                <p>After some briefings on the recent war, we were taken three or four levels down
                    to an officers' dining room where they gave us a magnificent lunch, which ended
                    with a baked Alaska, the last thing you would expect deep under the Egyptian
                    sands! Something about that lunch was my undoing. I don't know whether it was
                    the baked Alaska, unfiltered ice cubes or what, but not long after we got back
                    into our open command cars and started roaring across the desert I became
                    violently ill. So ill that I don't recall the rest of our trip to Cairo. I did
                    go on a sight seeing tour which had been arranged for us to the Grand Mosque in
                    Cairo, but then relapsed and spent the next 18 hours in bed in our hotel. It was
                    not till later the next day that somebody woke me up and said that I should get
                    dressed to go to the airport, since we were off to Lisbon and then home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to manage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, although when we got on our bus I still felt seriously ill and just
                    hung on to the seat in front of me hoping we would get to the airport soon.
                    Then, suddenly, I saw this big white blobby face in front of me, which turned to
                    be the admiral leading our group. He said, “George! Pull yourself together.
                    Sadat has just sent a motorcycle escort to turn us around because he wants to
                    see the group.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (Laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>JAEGER: He went on, “You're the State Department guy in the group, and you're
                    going to have to lead the discussion. You absolutely have to do this, its really
                    important.” I knew this was do or die, so I said “Admiral, if you can get me to
                    sit right next to a door that leads to a toilet, I will be delighted to talk to
                    Sadat!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: “But I'm really not in very good shape.” “We know that”, he said, “but we
                    know we can rely on you.”</p>
                <p>So the bus was turned around, and we drove for what seemed like an eternity to
                    Sadat's lovely villa on the Nile, where we were ushered into a huge airy room
                    with lots of windows looking out to the gardens and an enormous, extraordinarily
                    beautiful Persian carpet. To my horror I saw that there were thirty-some little
                    Louis Quatorze chairs set in a rectangle in the middle of the room, at the open
                    end of which was a little ornate desk where Sadat was obviously going to sit. To
                    make things worse, Egyptian protocol put me on the right side, the place
                    farthest from the exit!</p>
                <p>Sadat came in, smiling and relaxed in his loose, comfortable galabiyya and
                    sandals, welcomed us and spoke informally for some time about the war, Egypt's
                    problems and aspirations, and the importance of renewed good relations with the
                    US.</p>
                <p>To put it in context, our meeting took place only a few months after the 'Sinai
                    1' agreement, which had provided for a very limited Israeli withdrawal and just
                    a sliver of land east of the canal for the Egyptians; an agreement Cairo
                    officialdom had found deeply disappointing but which, we now know, Sadat had
                    decided to sign on the grounds that he might be able to obtain more later if he
                    did not rebuff Kissinger on this first try.</p>
                <p>It was also the time when the difficult 'Golan 1” negotiations were still under
                    way, which produced only a meager disengagement agreement on that front.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I think, Sadat's object at our meeting, at which Ambassador Herman
                    Eilts was busily taking notes, was to send positive vibes to Washington which
                    might help obtain restoration of more of the Sinai and economic aid.</p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>After his talk, Sadat stayed on to answer questions, returning again and again to
                    the theme of reconciliation. He clearly enjoyed the meeting and wanted us to see
                    him not as a head of state who had just lost a war, but as a warm, outgoing,
                    sophisticated human being who was glad to meet with us. At the end, an Air Force
                    lieutenant colonel went up to him, unpinned his wings from his uniform and
                    offered them to Sadat. “Mr. President,” he said, “I just want you to know that
                    we Americans too want peace, and I want you to have my flying wings as the only
                    thing I can give you.” Sadat was pleased as punch, hugged the guy and promptly
                    pinned the wings on his galabiyya! He really was a great warmhearted man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, your account certainly squares with the picture of
                        Sadat as a remarkable leader. But I began to wonder, as you were describing
                        this embrace of your delegation, if Sadat had already been given to
                        understand that there would be a lot of American aid in the offing if he
                        turned his policy around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The record seems to suggest that aid came later, although its hard to say
                    what inducements may have been held out on a discreet basis. The Egyptians
                    certainly had high hopes that aid would be forthcoming. Even so, the impression
                    we took away from our encounter was of a self-confident and tranquil leader, not
                    someone urgently trying to drum up help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you survive the meeting personally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It was a nightmare, but I somehow hung in there and managed to ask a few
                    questions. I don't remember much of the trip to Lisbon where I woke up the
                    following day, or for that matter of our subsequent trip home.</p>
                <p>e. Best thesis, speaker at graduation</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You clearly had a remarkable and memorable trip. Was that
                        the end of the War College year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Not quite. There was still Alumni Day and Graduation, and a totally
                    self-serving story. On one of our last days at McNair I was called to Ambassador
                    Leonhart's office, the pugnacious, sometimes a bit boozy but deeply dedicated
                    Deputy Commandant of the War College. He was pacing up and down, turned to me
                    and said, “Jaeger!” I said, “Yes, sir?” He said, “For reasons that totally
                    escape me, your War College thesis was picked by the faculty as the best paper
                    in the class. The trouble with that is that you will have to present a summary
                    on Alumni Day before the Joint Chiefs of Staff and all the rest of the Pentagon
                    brass.”</p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>“The point is” he said, as he continued pacing, “ that you will be the first
                    civilian who has ever been selected for this honor in the War College's history.
                    If you f*** this up Jaeger, I will personally cut your balls off! Do you
                    understand?” “</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I said I clearly understood, thanked him and rushed home to start
                    preparing a fifteen minute summary of a very complex technical paper which I now
                    somehow had to turn into an oratorical success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the thesis about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: 'The United States and Europe's Nuclear Defense'. The question was how
                    one might create a European nuclear arrangement in which the British, the
                    French, as well as the Germans could all take part in spite of the limiting
                    provisions of the McMahon Act and the Europeans' own concerns about German
                    nuclear rearmament. I had been intrigued by this issue ever since I was a
                    bystander in EUR to the rise and fall of the MLF (Multilateral Nuclear Force)
                    project and wanted to see if I could came up with a different model.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember the general argument?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: In retrospect it was a bit of a Rube Goldberg construct. As I remember
                    it, my small European nuclear deterrent force would have used British access to
                    American nuclear technology under the McMahon Act as its basis, built France
                    into the framework through its prowess with missiles, and brought in Germany,
                    without breaking its commitments under the NPT, by letting them pay for most of
                    it.</p>
                <p>The point was that, while retaining national responsibility for the system's
                    components, the Brits for the nukes, the French for the missiles and the Germans
                    for financing, there could then be a shared European command structure, allowing
                    the Germans a finger on a European nuclear force without being itself a nuclear
                    power.</p>
                <p>Why, in retrospect, I thought the French might agree to this escapes me, since De
                    Gaulle had already established their force de frappe and Paris probably had no
                    intention of ever letting the Germans near nukes or triggers. Be that as it may,
                    I had fun building my model and was very surprised that the War College thought
                    so highly of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did your presentation fare?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Come Alumni Day, I had a pretty bad case of stage fright, which got worse
                    when saw my audience. The entire Joint Chiefs of Staff and all sorts of other
                    three and four star brass were sitting in the front row in full dress uniform,
                    with several more rows of military and other bigwigs behind them. When my turn
                    came at the rostrum, I apparently did rise to the occasion and made an effective
                    presentation.</p>
                <p>So I survived intact and the following day graduated with distinction, a fact the
                    Commandant subsequently communicated to a no doubt deeply interested Henry
                    Kissinger. What was even nicer was that John McCloy wrote me a lovely note a few
                    weeks later congratulating me on doing the War College with “flying colors”. I
                    never discovered how he found out.</p>
                <p>Part VII: Negotiating the Helsinki Final Act and east-west relations at Embassy
                    Paris</p>
                <p>1. Off to Paris</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: To my delight and surprise I was next assigned as First Secretary for
                    Political Affairs in the American Embassy in Paris: Delight because this was
                    obviously a challenging assignment, surprise because I didn't have more than a
                    smattering of high school French and so had never expected to be sent to this
                    very sought-after post.</p>
                <p>Personnel explained that they wanted me there to help strengthen the Political
                    section which apparently had some problems, and packed me off to FSI for three
                    months of intensive French from which I 'graduated' just before Christmas of
                    1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you were off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. Pat, our infant daughter Christina and I arrived to a warm welcome
                    from my new boss, Political Counselor Hank Cohen - later Assistant Secretary for
                    African Affairs - who met us at the airport and took us to our temporary
                    quarters. As it turned out, I had hardly time to settle into my new office when
                    word came from Washington that they wanted me to go to Geneva on a temporary
                    assignment to help Ambassador Sherer and his delegation negotiate the Helsinki
                    Final Act!</p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>For Pat this was particularly hard, since, after 58 false starts, she had finally
                    found a wonderful large apartment for us overlooking Place d'Auteuil in the 16th
                    Arondissement. What's more, our shipment of effects had just been delivered and
                    stood around in large not yet unpacked cases, when I had to explain that, for an
                    as yet unspecified number of months, she would be on her own in Paris!</p>
                <p>2. Negotiating the Helsinki Final Act.</p>
                <p>JAEGER: I arrived in Geneva in April of 1975 to join a thoroughly frustrated
                    American delegation of a dozen officers to the 'Conference on Security and
                    Cooperation in Europe' who had been there for well over a year trying to
                    negotiate the terms of what came be called the Helsinki Final Act - and, so far,
                    had gotten virtually nowhere. In fact the 35 western and eastern nations, plus
                    the Vatican, who comprised the CSCE conference, had not been able to agree on
                    much more than chapter headings and a few scattered paragraphs here and there -
                    the rest being blank space where language would have to be inserted.</p>
                <p>a. Some background</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's first recall the background. The Helsinki process
                        derived from the USSR's longstanding desire for a European Security
                        Conference to ratify its post-war borders which went back to Molotov's
                        proposals in the fifties, no?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. The USSR had again and again resurrected the idea of a
                    multilateral European conference to confirm its post-World War II borders and
                    serve as a de facto peace treaty. This, of course, implied Western acceptance of
                    the division of Germany, recognition of the GDR's western and eastern boundaries
                    and confirmation of the USSR's grip over Eastern Europe and the Baltic states -
                    issues which in fact came to haunt President Ford and probably led to his defeat
                    after the Final Act was solemnly signed in Helsinki, on August 1 1975.</p>
                <p>The most important price the US and our European allies hoped to exact in return
                    was extensive human rights language, including cultural, religious, economic and
                    journalistic freedom, with which to combat Soviet abuses and weaken its
                    totalitarian grip. Curiously, Kissinger did not originally see human rights as
                    the key issue for the West, since he was focused on resolving the tangle of
                    major diplomatic questions still facing a European settlement. In the end he
                    came to understand that getting Brezhnev to sign up on human rights was probably
                    the major accomplishment of the whole process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We won't go into the whole complex history of the Helsinki
                        process, but perhaps you could give us a brief overview to set the
                        stage?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>JAEGER:? As we said, Nixon and Kissinger had originally been lukewarm about this
                    project, which gained momentum after the Berlin treaties of the early 1970's
                    which validated Brandt's Ostpolitik and ratified the division of Germany. US
                    reticence moderated further after it was agreed that decisions would only be
                    reached by consensus, that the US and Canada would be full participants and that
                    real gains might also materialize for the West, i.e. implied Soviet acceptance
                    of NATO and the US presence in Europe, and opportunities for making Brezhnev
                    accept human rights provisions.</p>
                <p>Others, particularly the French and their diplomatic allies, Belgium, Italy and
                    Spain, had other motives. Under France's leadership, these countries had for
                    some time seen an over-arching, permanent East-west security structure, which
                    the CSCE promised to create, as a way of reducing NATO and American influence,
                    without entirely eliminating them. By steering closer to Moscow than the other
                    allies, they were therefore both occasionally troublesome and influential.</p>
                <p>The French also played a major role in the Mediterranean context, where countries
                    like Malta, Italy and some on the north African littoral wanted the Med to be
                    recognized as an entity with special interests, issues in which I became much
                    involved.</p>
                <p>To promote these and other, partly inconsistent interests, participating
                    countries formed informal caucuses in which they coordinated their positions:
                    For example there was a NATO and a separate European community caucus; the more
                    neutral counties, including Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, Yugoslavia,
                    Malta, Cyprus, Lichtenstein and the Vatican, tried to be peacebrokers with a
                    relatively more muted agenda; the Mediterraneans met to work out their
                    positions, etc. So it was a very complex conference, not only because of the
                    number of states involved, but because each of the groups had special interests
                    which it pursued.</p>
                <p>b. The Helsinki “baskets”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We obviously won't be able to go into all these subsets,
                        but explain at least how all this was officially organized?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Essentially in three major and some minor 'baskets', each of which was
                    negotiated in separate large conference rooms by 36 representatives of the
                    participating states all sitting around a very large table.</p>
                <p>Basket I dealt with Security issues - such as sovereign equality of the
                    participating states, refraining from the threat or use of force, the
                    inviolability of frontiers, territorial integrity, peaceful settlement of
                    disputes, etc., as well as confidence building measures and notification of
                    major maneuvers and military movements - subjects which caused particular
                    difficulties.</p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>Basket II focused on Cooperation in Economics, Science, Technology and,
                    interestingly, the Environment, calling for free, unimpeded trade, business
                    contacts, exchange of technical information, industrial cooperation, scientific
                    exchange, tourism etc.</p>
                <p>Basket III was the famous human rights basket, “Humanitarian and other fields.”
                    which dealt in detail with facilitating family contacts and reunification; freer
                    travel and tourism; encouraging sports exchanges and meetings among young
                    people; improved conditions for journalists; improved access to and exchange of
                    information; greater cooperation and exchange in all aspects of culture and in
                    education - in short the whole range of human rights issues which would make for
                    greater openness behind the Curtain.</p>
                <p>Lastly, there were two special 'Baskets', one on provisions which should apply to
                    the 'Mediterranean'; the other, called the ' Follow-on' Basket, to determine the
                    vexed question whether the Helsinki Final Act would be a one-off event, would
                    result in one or more follow-on conferences, or become a permanent organization
                    - which in fact it did: First as the CSCE (the Conference on Security and
                    Co-operation in Europe) and, more recently, the OSCE (Organization for Security
                    and Co-operation in Europe), which has been much in the news because of its work
                    organizing and supervising elections in Bosnia, Kosovo and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>c. Months of Frustration, then the road opens to Helsinki.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What then was your task when you got to Geneva?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The head of the American delegation, Ambassador 'Bud' Sherer - an affable
                    and very able career officer who had been Ambassador in Prague - asked me to be
                    the American representative in the Mediterranean and the Follow-on baskets -
                    negotiations which involved two separate sets of frequent meetings at the
                    International Conference Center at which my 35 colleagues and I would, as a
                    result of Soviet Bloc obfuscation, accomplish virtually nothing for weeks on
                    end!</p>
                <p>Throughout April and May, as for many months before, the Soviet Bloc delegates
                    would get up in turn, spout virtually the same lines and refuse to budge. As a
                    result, we all had lots of time on our hands for leisurely lunches and long
                    walks on the Geneva waterfront, and doubted that the negotiation would come
                    together soon, if ever. All this was, of course, intensely frustrating,
                    particularly since I missed my family and hated my antiseptic Swiss hotel. All
                    this induced a severe stomach ailment which vanished as soon as Pat came to join
                    me at the house of old friends in Montreux.</p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>I have since read Jack Maresca's book “To Helsinki: the Conference on Security
                    and Cooperation in Europe 1973-1975”, Duke University Press 1985 - he was Bud
                    Sherer's Deputy, and the coordinator of our delegation - who paints a more
                    nuanced picture of gradual, perhaps even accelerating progress as roadblocks are
                    successively overcome in Geneva, by Kissinger and Gromyko and others in the
                    capitals. He had the broader view since he bases his account on discussions in
                    the Coordinating Committee of delegation heads. All I can say, is that that was
                    not apparent to me or my colleagues at the negotiating level. What does stand
                    out is my recollection that, toward the end of May, Bud Sherer called Maresca
                    and me in urgently, and said, “ The Soviets have just called up and said, 'Would
                    we come over to their residence?'" That was unusual.</p>
                <p>So the three of us went over to the Soviet residence. There was Yuri Dubinin, the
                    tough, lanky Soviet DCM, later Soviet Ambassador to the UN, then to the US, with
                    his leg casually draped over a chair. He handed us all a drink, looked at Bud
                    Sherer and said, “Well, Bud, how much is it going to cost us to cut the
                    mustard?” Sherer said, “You mean for the whole thing?” Dubinin said, “Yea, how
                    much?” Bud Sherer, still clearly astonished, said, “Well, you know how much.
                    You've got to sign onto all the human rights language, the religion language,
                    the journalism language, and all the rest. “ Dubinin said, “Fine.” We said,
                    “Well, how are you going to do this given the record over the last 12 months,
                    because we wont go back on our position. Dubinin said, “Oh, we don't expect you
                    to. It'll work out.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He got new instructions from Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. When Sherer asked, “What brought all this about?” Dubinin
                    replied, “Well, he's [Brezhnev] decided that he wants the [Helsinki] conference
                    to happen, and wants it on the proposed date, so we're going to finish it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: For the next six weeks we watched this amazing process in all the
                    baskets, including mine, in which the Soviet bloc countries, who had been
                    stonewalling for many months, would gradually take turns in moving,
                    step-by-step, from their previous rigid positions. When time was up we had a
                    text close to 90 percent of what we had wanted and, as Dubinin had said, the
                    road was clear for the formal signing of the Final Act at Helsinki on August 1,
                    1975!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So essentially you had your way and didn't have to split
                        the difference with Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Certainly there was some negotiating. But basically they inched
                    systematically toward our positions, even though during these last six weeks
                    they made us work hard for it.</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Trying to understand this Russian turnabout, how much did
                        it have to do with West Germany's Ostpolitik?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: No doubt German Ostpolitik was the key underlying factor, since confirmed
                    post-war German and Polish frontiers were essential from Moscow's perspective
                    before Soviet detente could go much further. But there were other things in it
                    for the Soviets, i.e. the Final Act by implication ratified Soviet control of
                    the Baltic states and seemed to confirm its grip on eastern Europe. Another
                    major factor was Brezhnev's vanity, since he clearly did not want to miss
                    starring at Helsinki, which he saw as the most important post-war conference
                    since Versailles. Tactically the turn-around was made possible by the secret
                    negotiations between Kissinger and the Soviets while we were in Geneva doing our
                    working level stuff - a parallel high-level track to which I, at least, was
                    never privy to. I suspect that Bud Sherer too was at least partly in the dark,
                    since he seemed as surprised as the rest of us over the Russian turnabout.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get over your illness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Quickly. This final phase was a much happier and satisfying time. After
                    committee meetings I took the train to Montreux, where Pat would pick me up for
                    the short drive up to Baugy sur Clarens where Pat, Christina and I were staying
                    with her cousin Edita and her husband Franco in their lovely old farm house. I
                    wrote my daily reporting telegrams while speeding along Lake Geneva, spent a
                    nice evening with Pat, Franco and Edita, and then trained back to Geneva early
                    in the morning, when I would hand in my telegram. Washington never realized that
                    there was a time gap between my meetings and the dispatch of my reports. It was
                    in the end a happy and satisfying time.</p>
                <p>d. How the Soviets miscalculated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any dealings with the Soviets outside the
                        official meetings at the conference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, the most telling encounter involves a lunch at an elegant Geneva
                    restaurant with the coordinator of the Soviet delegation, a very bright,
                    competent diplomat, to celebrate the conclusion of our negotiations. After
                    several toasts, I said to him, “You know, what I simply can't grasp is why in
                    the end you accepted all the human rights stuff. It will undo the USSR.” He
                    looked at me with amusement - we were munching on some very nice smoked salmon
                    at the time, part of our non-proletarian lunch...</p>

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: ....and said, “Mr. Jaeger, please! I thought you were experienced
                    diplomat. I think your question is, if I may say, na�ve! Do you really think
                    that the Soviet Union will pay the slightest attention to any of this?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He said that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. I said to him, “You know, let's meet 20 years from now and see who
                    has been na�ve. I think you will find that these words you agreed to will have a
                    corrosive effect on your system, like water dripping on a rock! As your people
                    hear about them, and we will of course make sure they do, they will want you to
                    live up to them, and step by step the Soviet Union is going to be forced to
                    accept a lot of these principles, with far-reaching results.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. Which, of course, they did. Although we parted on friendly terms, he
                    left unconvinced that the USSR had signed more than a scrap of paper of no
                    consequence.</p>
                <p>As the USSR disintegrated some years later - in some significant part because of
                    the human rights campaigns, reinforced by Soviet commitments in the Final Act, I
                    often thought of that lunch, and was rather proud of what we had wrought.</p>
                <p>Before we all left Geneva, Bud Sherer asked me if I would do a wrap-up telegram
                    assessing the CSCE negotiation, which would put what we had negotiated into its
                    broader perspective. Apparently he and people in Washington liked the telegram.
                    I myself always thought it was too long, too wordy, and wished that I had George
                    Kennan's gift of dealing with great issues in plain and simple terms.</p>
                <p>Be that as it may, the argument I made in that concluding telegram was the same
                    one I made over lunch with the Soviet diplomat, that the impact of the Helsinki
                    text on the Soviet Union would be that of water dripping on stone. Although the
                    totalitarian Soviet system seemed impregnable in 1975, over time, perhaps over a
                    long time, the fundamental principles they signed on to at Helsinki would wear
                    them down and undo their regime. In retrospect this has been the case. The
                    Helsinki Act was a major turning point.</p>
                <p>e. The Mediterranean Basket</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we talk a bit now about the two baskets in which
                        you were the US representative, beginning with the Mediterranean. What
                        happened there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Let's first set the stage for what turned out to be a hilarious
                    denouement, in which we ended in cahoots with the Soviets trying to deal with
                    Malta - and failed!</p>
                <p>From the outset, even in the preparatory talks in 1973, there was pressure from
                    the European Mediterranean states that the Mediterranean region should have some
                    distinct status and that part of the Final Act should be devoted to it.</p>
                <p>Initially there were battles over who was to be recognized as a Mediterranean
                    state - since the Maltese pressed for the inclusion of Algeria and Tunisia,
                    which in turn raised the question of all the other littoral states, including
                    Israel.</p>
                <p>The solution arrived at with some difficulty allowed all such non-participating
                    states to make written presentations to the preparatory CSCE meeting, proposing
                    agenda items and questions relating to Baskets I and II, but not Basket III,
                    which would have opened the door to discussion of the emigration of Soviet Jews
                    to Israel.</p>
                <p>These issues arose again early in the Geneva phase when the Mediterranean member
                    states again pressed for agreement to allow the non-participating states to
                    return for follow-up questions and explanations, which was, very reluctantly,
                    granted. In short, there were north-south divisions at the conference from the
                    outset which required careful tending so that they would not distract from or
                    impede the major east-west issues the Helsinki process was primarily meant to
                    deal with. This became all the more tricky, as we will see, because all CSCE
                    decisions had to be unanimous.</p>
                <p>Later, in June '74, the nine European Community states - led by Italy, France and
                    Malta - tabled a joint 'Mediterranean Declaration', which the US at first
                    resisted, fearing that it would introduce the Israel-Arab dispute into this
                    already highly complicated conference; but then accepted, after the Europeans
                    appealed to Kissinger, stressing the importance of their relations with the
                    Arabs. This in turn resulted in the creation of the Mediterranean working group
                    on which I was to sit, and prompted the introduction of an even more ambitious
                    draft by the Maltese.</p>
                <p>Even so, the Mediterranean issue did not come center stage until late April or
                    early May 1975, after I had just joined the working group. After agreement had
                    finally been reached on a long but anodyne Preamble to the eventual text, the
                    Maltese dropped their bomb shell - calling for language that would establish
                    special links between the Mediterranean states and the Arab world and require
                    the gradual withdrawal of Soviet and American forces from the Mediterranean
                    area!</p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>At first, all of us largely ignored this proposal, which was just as unwelcome to
                    the Soviet Bloc as to the Western powers. We all assumed it was being made for
                    the record and would in due course be withdrawn.</p>
                <p>However, as time pressure to finish the negotiations mounted in June, Malta's
                    Ambassador Victor Gauci, a dear and kindly diplomat who understood the situation
                    perfectly, warned us again and again that Malta's Prime Minister, Dom Mintoff,
                    was utterly serious and not bluffing. By the end of June the Maltese tone
                    hardened further, as Gauci made clear on instruction that Mintoff was prepared
                    to withhold Malta's consent to the Final Act, in effect sinking the Helsinki
                    process since unanimity was required, until his demands were met. The mouse had
                    roared!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well that must have put the cat among the pigeons!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: And how! Efforts were of course made to meet the Maltese part way with
                    broad language encouraging 'better relations with the non-participating states',
                    including 'all states in the Mediterranean'. But Mintoff remained unimpressed
                    and responded by having his representative block the follow-on agreement as
                    well. It was now clear that the Helsinki process hung in the balance and that
                    all of us, east and west, were facing a full-dress crisis.</p>
                <p>After a final appeal was made to Dom Mintoff, he sent a team of four Maltese
                    Ambassadors to Geneva on July 10 who, together with Ambassador Gauci, were to
                    meet with five diplomats representing the Mediterranean Working group. I was
                    asked to be the American negotiator.</p>
                <p>The meeting in the Conference Center was to begin at seven PM. I went there at
                    about five-thirty and ran into Soviet Ambassador Lev Mendelevich, a rotund
                    Jewish gentleman, who was my Soviet counterpart. Mendelevich hailed me with a
                    touch of sarcasm, “Ah, Meester Jaeger. I suppose you are well prepared for this
                    negotiation.” I said, “Well, you know, we have our positions, and I think we're
                    prepared.” Mendelevich went on the offensive, “I don't think so at all. Have you
                    eaten?” Somewhat taken aback, I said, “Well, no, but I expect there'll be a
                    sandwich or something.”</p>
                <p>He said, “I thought so! Let me teach you first Soviet principle of negotiation!
                    Make sure Soviet representation eats so that we will be strong, and the other
                    side does not eat, therefore hungry and weak. America and the USSR are partners
                    this time in dealing with these Maltese. The Maltese are flying in late, won't
                    have had time to eat. So let's go to the restaurant together and eat!”</p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>We did, but only found a forlorn-looking waiter setting tables who told us the
                    restaurant was closed. Mendelevich was undeterred, shouted at the poor wretch
                    that he was an Ambassador of the USSR and asked that the manager be sent for.
                    When the latter appeared a few minutes later, and again tried to explain that
                    the restaurant was closed, Mendelevich went into a table-banging tantrum and, as
                    a small crowd of onlookers gathered around, threatened the manager with an
                    official complaint from the USSR which would get him fired! The manager got the
                    point, rousted out a crew and a few minutes later served us a hearty meal.</p>
                <p>When we had finished, Mendelevich, again in high good humor, said, “OK. Now we
                    have taken care of our bodies. What's your plan for winning in this
                    negotiation?” I said, “Well, I guess we'll see what they have to say, and then
                    advance our positions. It will help that this time you and I will be in
                    agreement.” “ Yes indeed”, Mendelevich said, “But how are we going to wear them
                    down?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: “Here”, he continued, “is the game plan. I will play the bad guy as
                    usual, and you will be the good guy. When the five Maltese Ambassadors come in,
                    I will begin to insult them. Then, as the talks get under way, I will insult
                    them some more. I will tell them that they're representatives of a totally
                    insignificant, irrelevant little country, that they are being objectionable and
                    that their positions are an affront and make no sense. After this has gone on
                    for a while, and they are upset, you will you will intervene and say, 'Mr.
                    Soviet Ambassador, you are being a little bit strong with these nice friends of
                    ours. Don't you think that a little politer tone might get us a further in this
                    discussion?'" Then Mendelevich got to the point. “Each time we go through this,
                    they will make a small concession because they will be so grateful to you. We
                    will keep this up as long as necessary until we win. This”, he concluded,” is
                    Soviet negotiating method. It always works.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not totally new to people who've dealt with the Russians,
                        but fascinating that he would lay it out for you!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, we tried it his way. The Maltese came, Mendelevich was rude to them
                    and got more and more insulting as the evening went on. I played the good guy
                    and our British colleague soon joined in, appealing to him to moderate his
                    insulting behavior. And you know what? The Maltese didn't budge an inch!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Not one inch!</p>
                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So his game plan didn't work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It got to be eleven o'clock, then midnight. Everybody was getting tired
                    and the Maltese were increasingly annoyed as Mendelevich kept escalating his
                    insults and abuse. At one o'clock the Maltese head of delegation said, “We have
                    had enough. We're going home. Good night gentlemen. This is the end of the
                    discussion,” and walked out.</p>
                <p>I couldn't help but turn to Mendelevich and say, “Well, so much for Soviet
                    diplomacy, eh?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter. So how was it all resolved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: What I, at least, didn't know was that Kissinger and Gromyko were also
                    meeting in Geneva that night, and, as Maresca reports in his book, heard
                    Kovalev, the Head of the Soviet Delegation, argue that, since the Maltese could
                    not be permitted to hold the Helsinki process hostage, they should simply be
                    isolated and cut out.</p>
                <p>Kissinger then asked Ambassador Sherer for his view. Sherer argued to the
                    contrary that the principle of unanimity was so central to the CSCE, that
                    breaking it would only lead others to side with the Maltese and undermine the
                    whole process.</p>
                <p>The next day, the Maltese, under continuing high-level pressure, agreed to accept
                    the palliative paragraph they had been offered, provided the phrase “reducing
                    armed forces in the region” was added as an additional objective of contacts
                    with non-participating states. It was the same poison pill in new language!</p>
                <p>Since Mintoff held all the cards, the US, the USSR and all the other delegations
                    were in the end instructed to swallow their objections and accept Mintoff's
                    language - with the agreed mental reservation that it would just never be put in
                    practice. So the Helsinki process was saved and the ignominiously agreed text
                    made part of the Final Act under” Questions relating to Security and Cooperation
                    in the Mediterranean”. Paragraph 412 contains the Conference's concession to Dom
                    Mintoff's blackmail. The road was cleared to Helsinki, where the Final Act was
                    solemnly adopted on July 30.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So everyone agreed to handle Malta the way the Russians
                        thought they were going to handle human rights.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                <p>JAEGER: I am afraid that's right. Even so, the drive by Malta, Italy and others
                    did give the Final Act a Mediterranean dimension which subsequently produced
                    some modestly constructive projects under the CSCE umbrella. And subsequent
                    Maltese governments did not persist in Dom Mintoff's campaign to 'neutralize'
                    the Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>f. The 'Follow-on' negotiation</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened in the other committee on which you were the
                        US representative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That was the 'Follow-on' working group and the question it faced was what
                    should happen after Helsinki.</p>
                <p>Views on this evolved, since most delegations wanted to see what the outcome of
                    the CSCE would be before taking final positions on follow-on. The USSR, which
                    had for years been pressing for a permanent trans-European organization of
                    nations, and might have been expected to favor a structured follow-on, retreated
                    and argued for limiting the follow-on to the 'possibility' of a new conference -
                    presumably to prevent the creation of any permanent mechanism to check on their
                    human rights compliance.</p>
                <p>Conversely, the Romanians, represented by Ambassador Lipatti, a spectacularly
                    many-sided, able diplomat, argued vigorously for periodic follow-on meetings, in
                    what sometimes sounded like a crusade to open the way to greater interaction
                    across the Iron Curtain - the only satellite to do so.</p>
                <p>France, which, like the USSR, had originally been supportive of an over-arching
                    'European' system, also retreated somewhat, limiting itself toward the end to
                    supporting the Danish proposal for a single review conference, presumably out of
                    concern over possible US or Soviet use of a permanent organization to meddle in
                    European affairs. Other NATO members took a more positive view and generally
                    felt that regular follow-on meetings would be in everyone's interest. The
                    neutrals too did not want the process to end with the signing ceremony at
                    Helsinki.</p>
                <p>As for the US, the view was that we did not want an overarching system of
                    nations, which could interfere with and potentially overshadow NATO, which the
                    USSR and France could use to weaken America's role in Europe. Our position
                    therefore was simple, we wanted no follow-on to the Helsinki Final Act, end of
                    story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not very helpful from a human rights point of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0233" n="Page0233"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Right. But, given these instructions, I held firm for a number of weeks
                    against almost everyone else, since the general feeling, as I have just
                    outlined, was that there should be some follow-on. So, I was officially the bad
                    guy in that committee, although personally we were all on very cordial terms.
                    Things got to such a level of frustration, that France's Director for European
                    Affairs Jacques Andr�ani, (the equivalent of our Assistant Secretary of State)
                    came to two meetings to see for himself why the Americans were so adamantly
                    holding up progress. Once I returned to Paris we had a warm and very productive
                    relationship. But in Geneva we were for a time on opposite sides of the
                    argument.</p>
                <p>Eventually, I reached the conclusion that Washington's position could not prevail
                    and recommended that we inflect our position. Subsequent instructions were more
                    flexible and permitted me to negotiate towards language which would broadly
                    endorse continuation of the multilateral process started by the CSCE and permit
                    at least one follow-on conference to assess implementation and consider the
                    “modalities of other meetings”.</p>
                <p>This compromise was in the end adopted, and satisfied Washington's related
                    concern that the CSCE process not result in the creation of a permanent
                    secretariat, like the NATO bureaucracy or the Headquarters staff of the European
                    Union.</p>
                <p>A follow-on conference did take place in Belgrade in 1977 and, with new US
                    support, lead to a succession of further high-level CSCE, then OSCE
                    (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) conferences. They in turn
                    created sub-organizations and a permanent staff to support whoever the Foreign
                    Minister was who served as Chairman-in-Office on a rotating basis. An outline of
                    OSCE's current structure and activities can be gleaned from its website at
                    http://www.osce.org/about/13509.html. As the Cold War subsided the US reversed
                    it initial hesitancy further and became a leading supporter of OSCE's work,
                    particularly its role of promoting human rights and organizing and monitoring
                    elections, from Bosnia and Kosovo to Putin's Russia.</p>
                <p>3.Then back to Paris</p>
                <p>a. Another new beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Geneva conference ended in July 1975 you went
                        back to the Embassy in Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, still another beginning in, what in retrospect, was one of the most
                    challenging assignments of my career. As second ranking officer in the Embassy's
                    large Political Section I now had broad reporting and policy responsibilities
                    for France's east-west relations; a charge later expanded to include France's
                    Western-European and Mediterranean relations, including special issues like
                    Cyprus and Portugal's struggle to become a democratic country. Still later, I
                    was made Deputy Political Counselor, a new position which was created for me,
                    with management responsibility for the work of the section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sounds like quite a challenge!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The trick was keeping all these balls in the air, while making and
                    maintaining effective contacts at the Quai d'Orsay, the Elysee, among Paris's
                    intellectual and journalist elite and with its many Embassies, including the
                    Soviet and the swath of Iron Curtain Missions.</p>
                <p>Personally it was a wonderful, if often stressful, time. Pat, Christina and I
                    gradually settled into our lovely top-floor apartment overlooking the Place
                    d'Auteuil, with its bustling, colorful biweekly market, the Auteuil subway
                    station and an oyster merchant virtually at our door. Our kitchen was cramped
                    and separated from our elegant dining room, with its French windows, by a too
                    long corridor which made serving hot food a daily challenge. But these
                    shortcomings were made up for by the large and airy formal rooms which were
                    ideal both for our family life and for entertaining. Christina, now five, was
                    enrolled at Notre Dame des Oiseaux on Rue Michel Ange, virtually around the
                    corner, came to speak French like a native and, I think, rather liked playing
                    Madeleine in this strange new world.</p>
                <p>In due course, we even shared a weekend get-away from the pressures of Paris with
                    our colleagues Bob and Mette Beecroft - a damp gatehouse on an estate owned by
                    dour and impecunious Lionel Armand Delisle, near Dampierre in the Beauce - whose
                    chimney smoked uncontrollably whenever a fire was lit to overcome the cold.</p>
                <p>Getting there, or anywhere beyond the city confines, involved hours of fighting
                    Paris weekend traffic. But the rewards were long walks on the paths
                    crisscrossing the wooded estate, picnics and games, and the special fun of
                    surreptitiously liberating a few of Delisle's thousands of pheasants which he
                    kept penned up, to be released from time to time for his commercial 'hunts',
                    when rich Germans popped away at them and were then rewarded with an 'authentic'
                    hunters' banquet at the chateau - decked out and candle-lit for the occasion.
                    Although Armand Delisle suspected that I was the culprit, I redeemed myself when
                    I found and returned his beloved riding horse, one day, which had gone
                    astray.</p>

                <p>When, after some months, the smoke and damp of our gatehouse had lost their charm
                    we rented a more comfortable weekend retreat from Jacques Leprette, then French
                    Ambassador to the UN - an ancient farm house near Toucy in northern Burgundy,
                    which, with its ancient windmill, overlooked the wheat field where Charlemagne's
                    nephews had divided France at the Battle of Fontenoy in 841 AD. That battle,
                    according to recent research, was a huge affair which left tens of thousands
                    dead. Ironically, the short inscription on the nineteenth century obelisk
                    commemorating the carnage does not lament this first failure to maintain a
                    united Europe, but remarks with unabashed nationalism, that “it was here that
                    the victory of Charles the Bald, separated France from the Western Empire and
                    established the independence of the French nation”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hardly surprising for the time, although not quite the
                        text they would choose if the monument were to be replaced.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: History aside, our weekend perch in Burgundy was a marvelous place from
                    which to explore Burgundy's ancient towns and villages, including Autun, Cluny
                    and other medieval treasures, the area's fabulous vineyards, and, last but not
                    least, the region's many restaurants, among the best in France. I also
                    discovered that French officialdom in Paris was one thing, but that 'la France
                    profonde' lived in the Provinces, where people were warm and outgoing, Americans
                    were welcomed for their roles in two World Wars, and where all French
                    politicians ultimately had their roots.</p>
                <p>I am digressing.</p>
                <p>b. The Political Section and its travails.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, but still relevant and interesting. Let's go back
                        now to the challenges you faced in getting started in the Political Section
                        and with your work at the Quai d'Orsay and elsewhere. Tell us first a bit
                        about the Political Section and the Embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: We were a section of 19 political officers - somewhat an overstatement
                    since almost half were from the Station and kind of floated in and out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are we supposed to infer from that what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0236" n="Page0236"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, if you like. Particularly after I was made Deputy Counselor, I was
                    supposed to know them all but didn't. So it was sometimes disconcerting when
                    somebody I had never seen before would come gushing up to us at a cocktail party
                    and say, “Oh, my husband is enjoying so much working in your section.” I would,
                    of course, smile brightly and then say to Pat, “Who the hell was that?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: To get back to the point, the regular members of the Political Section
                    were a brilliant bunch. The Counselor, Hank Cohen, an outstanding Africanist,
                    French expert and gifted analyst, focused mainly on the French left and was
                    adept at running productive staff discussions. He would introduce some major
                    question and deftly weave everyone's contributions into a coherent whole, which
                    would then form the basis of a major, often very perceptive telegram. Hank was
                    much less gifted as a manager. In his Oral History of the period he describes
                    the very capable but strong-willed officers in this Political Section as
                    typically 'superior' 'Europeanists', a description clearly not meant as a
                    compliment which said more about Hank's own insecurities than the generally very
                    high caliber of his staff. From my perspective the main problem was his
                    cautious, self-protective management style - he would simply disappear into his
                    office and type away on telegrams - which left the obvious conflicts in the
                    section unresolved and me often in the middle.</p>
                <p>The key problems, when I arrived, were between John Dobrin, a brilliantly verbal,
                    undisciplined youngish officer and so-so drafter, who would come in when he
                    pleased and do what he wanted - but who knew France better than any of us and
                    had developed extraordinary contacts with the French left, including Francois
                    Mitterrand and other key people in the Socialist and Communist parties.</p>
                <p>On the other end of the spectrum was Marvin Humphries, the Embassy's high-strung,
                    intensely turf-conscious tall and handsome Political/Military Officer, who was
                    in constant combat with Dobrin, whom he despised, and who also had major
                    difficulties with the Brigadier General who was the Embassy's Military Attach�
                    and others. Marvin prepared for my arrival by letting it be known at the Quai
                    d'Orsay that I was a junior officer who worked for him, and that he should
                    always be consulted if anything I said produced questions or doubts. Needless to
                    say, it took some effort and time to set the record straight.</p>
                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>Things improved markedly when Humphries was replaced by competent and relaxed
                    John Kelly - who later became Ambassador to Lebanon and Finland and Assistant
                    Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs; although Marvin gave us one last, horrendous
                    shock when we learned from news reports that, some months after he had returned
                    to Washington, he had shot his two young sons and his lovely wife, whom we all
                    knew and liked, and then committed suicide! He was a deeply troubled personality
                    whose illness should have been diagnosed and dealt with long before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How horrible. No wonder there were problems! What were the
                        rest like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Varied and uniformly able. In no particular order, there was Mark Pratt,
                    our experienced Far East and Vietnam expert, who helped Henry Kissinger on his
                    frequent meetings with the Vietnamese in Paris, and was famous for the mounds of
                    classified and other papers which always graced his desk and produced endless
                    security violations and for the superb Chinese dinners which he prepared for the
                    favored, which sometimes included Pat and myself, in his bachelor digs. There
                    was 'Frecky' (Fredrick) Vreeland, the urbane son of Diana Vreeland, our UN
                    expert, who may also have had other less visible duties, perhaps having to do
                    with his long relationship with the king of Morocco and others at the top levels
                    of the social world. I will never forget the day the phone rang and a deep
                    feminine voice said hoarsely: “Is Frecky there? This is the Duchess of Windsor!”
                    There was also Chuck Redman, a bright, gifted young officer, joined the French
                    internal politics reporting unit, did excellent work and enhanced amity. He
                    later became Department spokesman. I should also mention Phil Rizik, the scion
                    of a Washington clothing store, who headed the internal unit and did a fairly
                    competent job, although managing Dobrin was beyond him.</p>
                <p>Q; Was Hank Cohen there throughout your tour?</p>
                <p>JAEGER: No, he was replaced for a few months in '77 by Jack Myerson, a
                    delightful, experienced Europeanist who had just finished a gig as Ambassador to
                    the UN Economic and Social Council and was in a holding pattern before becoming
                    the Embassy's highly respected Economic Counselor: A voluntary step down which
                    enabled him to live in Paris. Jack and I had met and become friends years
                    earlier through Pat, who had known him in Brussels and were both delighted at
                    this chance to work together. He was soon replaced by Warren Zimmerman, who was
                    to become famous as our 'last Ambassador to Yugoslavia'. Warren ran the place
                    like the serious pro he was, did a brilliant job at developing high-level
                    contacts and raised the work of the Section to a new level. As his then Deputy I
                    much liked and greatly admired him.</p>
                <p>c. A study in contrasts: Ambassadors Rush and Hartman</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get back to your work, tell us briefly about the
                        Ambassadors during your time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>JAEGER: The first was the same Kenneth Rush for whom I had worked in Bonn. He
                    had, in the meantime, been Nixon's Deputy Secretary of Defense and Deputy
                    Secretary of State and, after Nixon's resignation, had been asked by President
                    Ford to take on Paris. He was a thoroughly nice man, consistently kind and
                    appreciative of our work, but didn't speak a word of French and, in spite of his
                    years in Bonn, didn't have a deep understanding of European affairs. The
                    residence at rue Saint Honor� reflected his mid-western background and tastes,
                    mostly American cowboy pictures and wild west stuff. French officialdom,
                    predictably, did not relate to him or appreciate his mild but frequent
                    English-language admonitions through which he thought he was advancing American
                    positions. Rush and his wife did not seem to notice, and, instead of getting to
                    know the real France, spent a good deal of time visiting and hobnobbing with
                    France's now largely impotent aristocracy in their various great chateaus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like a typical political appointee.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, maybe a shade above, since he really was a kind and good-hearted
                    man. He became a burden only when he went on official trips to various parts of
                    France, because he required major, grotesquely detailed briefing books for every
                    stop he made, even if it was only at a 'mairie' in some minor town.</p>
                <p>There were also some major gaffes which made the rounds of Paris, such as the one
                    about Mr. and Mrs. Rush's visit to Chartres cathedral, whose dignitaries, as you
                    would expect, had put on a big show. After the presiding bishop had shown them
                    the stained glass windows and discoursed on the cathedral's history, he invited
                    them to join him in going up the tower to enjoy the famous view of the town and
                    its surrounding countryside. At which, and I can vouch for this since I was
                    there, Mrs. Rush famously blurted out, “Kenny, do we really have to? My feet
                    hurt!” “Well, honey,” Rush replied, “ in that case, maybe we better cut this
                    short, and let's just go straight to lunch.” The French, of course, were
                    appalled. I recount this not to ridicule but to explain why he probably was not
                    our most distinguished Ambassador to France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he launch any worthwhile new projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0239" n="Page0239"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. He thought all of us should find out first hand what people were
                    thinking across France during the run-up to the important municipal elections,
                    in which Francois Mitterrand's Socialist-Communist alliance threatened, to
                    Washington's chagrin, to carry the day. Some grumbled that in a country as
                    centralized as France one can follow the regional press and opinion polls from
                    one's office and so get elections right without making long time-consuming
                    trips. The counter-argument was that many of the politicians with their fingers
                    on the pulse were local mayors or had other hometown roles and were more
                    available in the provinces than they were in Paris. I for one strongly agreed
                    that we could all benefit from the chance to spend over a week out of the office
                    interviewing journalists, mayors and ordinary people in the provinces.</p>
                <p>I, for my trip, had drawn the south-west, starting my explorations in Limoges and
                    P�rigueux and then drove on through small towns and villages to Cahors and Albi.
                    At each stop I was overcome by the unexpected warmth of people, who might or
                    might not have given me much time in Paris, who were clearly delighted that I
                    had come to see them in their home towns. As a result there were many long and
                    informative discussions over splendid meals in cozy local restaurants. My only
                    trouble was that I was invariably asked if I would try the specialty of the
                    region, which, just as invariably, was delicious, but very rich cassoulet de
                    confit d'oie, washed down with great local wines and finished with desserts and
                    vintage armagnacs.</p>
                <p>So I came back to Paris noticeably heavier than I had left, but a good deal more
                    aware what France was thinking and, for that matter, what it was all about. The
                    trip was also an opportunity to see things I might otherwise have missed, such
                    as the vineyards of Cahors, the fortress church in Albi with its frightening
                    murals which mother church erected to remind future generations what it could do
                    to heretics, and the almost mystic beauty of the French countryside in the cold
                    mists of early March.</p>
                <p>All in all Rush was right to send us out of town, although our basic prediction,
                    that Mitterrand's Socialist/Communist coalition would sweep the municipal
                    election remained unchanged. As it turned out the left won 155 of 221 cities and
                    towns with populations over 30,000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Rush did make a contribution after all. Who followed
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Arthur Hartman arrived later in 1977 and could not have been more
                    different: A superb career Foreign Service officer, who had just been Assistant
                    Secretary for European Affairs, Hartman had the stature and breadth of
                    experience the job called for and, with the help of his gifted wife Donna,
                    immediately took Paris by storm.</p>
                <pb facs="0240" n="Page0240"/>
                <p>For starters, out went the cowboy pictures, to be replaced by an eye-popping
                    collection of French art, including Monet's, Manet's and other famous French
                    impressionists and post-impressionists. It seems that before their arrival, Mrs.
                    Hartman had persuaded American museums to loan them to the Embassy for display
                    in the residence. When the French Foreign Minister arrived for their first
                    glittering reception on rue St. Honor� he was clearly blown away: “My goodness,
                    Mrs. Hartman,” I heard him say, “you have a Monet!” Mrs. Hartman replied with
                    little smile, “Ah, but you see, Mr. Minister, that's only the first! The rest
                    are coming later.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: In short the Hartman's, both fluent in French, made a terrific impression
                    and from the outset greatly improved the quality of our relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hartman, I believe, went to Moscow after Carter sent him
                        to Paris and was very well thought of there too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. From our perspective in the Political Section, life also
                    became less stressful. Out went the immensely time-consuming briefing books,
                    because Art Hartman was a pro who knew what to do. Instead Art welcomed new
                    thinking, appreciated good reporting and creative recommendations. I always
                    thought of this tall, aquiline, fast-moving but graceful man as our Jewish
                    Prince.</p>
                <p>d. Coping with French!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You yourself had to learn French to manage this
                        assignment. How did you make out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That recalls a funny story. One of my very first calls at the Quai
                    d'Orsay was on Ives Omnes, the Director of Soviet and Eastern European Affairs,
                    who was to be one of my main contacts for my work on Soviet and satellite
                    issues.</p>
                <p>Needless to say, my French was still pretty wobbly and I was, understandably,
                    somewhat nervous. Omnes greeted me warmly in French and, after I sat down at his
                    desk, explained that he had been concerned that Washington may not completely
                    understand all the nuances of the then French policy toward the satellites and
                    the USSR and proposed a series of five meetings, in which he would set out and
                    explain French East-West policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>When he saw that I was ready to take notes, he began his first disquisition,
                    talked for almost an hour and then sent me off. Together these five initial
                    meetings produced a really remarkable series of telegrams, because the French
                    had never before, to my knowledge, so systematically laid out their Soviet and
                    east-west thinking for us. Even so, writing them was a nightmare, since, with my
                    still rather limited French, I was continually worried that Omnes might have
                    said something that I had misunderstood or that I had missed something
                    important, and so sent Washington off in the wrong direction.</p>
                <p>The surprise came when we met for the last of this series and Omnes looked at me
                    with a kindly smile and said in perfect Oxford English: “Well, George, I think
                    you've now worked hard enough, and you've made some progress. Why don't we do
                    this one in English!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I had evidently passed the test, and, as it turned out, the telegrams all
                    this produced were all right as well! In time my French got pretty good and
                    became a major asset.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask you earlier, how you managed the
                        language issue in the Geneva negotiations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: We had simultaneous translation into all the key languages, linguists in
                    little booths which were set up in each conference room, with wires running all
                    over the place. We could both listen to others and speak in English...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...with radio headsets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. It really worked very efficiently. But living and working in France
                    was quite another matter. The French are often ridiculed for their insistence on
                    the use of French. Its partly a matter of survival, since they don't want to be
                    submerged linguistically, and partly a matter of cultural self respect. I
                    suspect we would do the same thing if the tables were reversed.</p>
                <p>e. The web of globe-spanning issues</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your initial job was to cover France's east-west
                        relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0242" n="Page0242"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. Reporting on and analyzing French east-west relations was the core
                    job. This had all sorts of ramifications beyond Paris' bilateral relations with
                    Moscow, including the evolving SALT and other arms control developments, CSCE
                    issues, Berlin, GDR and FRG policy, as well as France's often rather special
                    relations with Poland and the other Soviet satellites.</p>
                <p>Given France's tendency to play at the margins of Western policy toward Moscow
                    and its satellites as a way of enhancing its own role, some of this was fairly
                    tricky, since Paris sometimes went to some lengths to keep us in the dark. Given
                    Moscow's involvement in the French Communist party, which was then still quite
                    influential, my work also involved some aspects of French domestic issues.</p>
                <p>Later, as I think I mentioned, I was also asked to take on French Mediterranean
                    policy, including Portugal's precarious transition to a left-leaning democracy
                    under Mario Soares and Cyprus. In 1977 I was made Deputy Political Counselor, a
                    new position created for me, with responsibility for the day-to-day management
                    of the Political Section and was asked to add French Western European relations
                    to my portfolio. To round things out we had intensely energy and time consuming
                    visits by Jimmy Carter, French elections, a visit by Brezhnev, not to mention
                    the world's highest rate of Congressional visits.</p>
                <p>f. A working Day in Paris</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe we could get a sense how you managed all this if you
                        were to describe an average working day.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, it was nothing like the popular idea people have of the relaxed
                    life of striped-pants diplomats. Virtually every evening there was either a
                    national day reception or some other social function followed by a dinner
                    offered by another Embassy, French friends or someone on our staff. Frequently
                    we ourselves would entertain, a big job for Pat, since we didn't have help and
                    she put on the whole show by herself. Her peak performance was a sit-down
                    Thanksgiving dinner for twenty-two, a memorable occasion at which the
                    distinguished French lady at my right skeptically held up something on her fork
                    for my inspection and asked me “exactly what it was?” It, I explained, is a
                    “sweet potato” - which she then made plain was clearly not part of Paris'
                    culinary repertoire! But then cultural relations are never easy!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So all this socializing was important?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Of course. It was one way of meeting all sorts of people, across the
                    spectrum of government and the diplomatic corps, in French intellectual circles,
                    journalism and other key professions. To understand a country and its policies
                    you have to get inside its skin, and that means knowing, and being on warm terms
                    with, lots of different, well-positioned people. When an unexpected situation
                    arises and you have to scratch around at the last minute to see who can provide
                    background and perspective its usually too late.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Who were your closest friends in Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: My warmest and most interesting recollections were of the lovely evenings
                    offered by Dominique and John Riggs, he a leading American lawyer at the Paris
                    office of White and Case, she the daughter of legendary French Ambassador,
                    Francis Lacoste, former Governor General of Djibouti and Morocco, Minister in
                    Peking, Ambassador in Ottawa and Brussels: A classic diplomat of the old school,
                    who had the special distinction of having been fired by de Gaulle for being too
                    pro-American! It was one of the joys of this period that he became my friend and
                    mentor, and remained so until he died, long after we had left Paris,. Together,
                    the Riggs knew everybody in Paris and an evening there was invariably an
                    introduction to new sets of fascinating, often important people in diplomacy,
                    politics and the arts. We have all remained good friends, although they are,
                    alas, no longer married.</p>
                <p>So, to get back to the main point, evenings usually meant brilliant food and
                    drink, but were often more work than entertainment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bit hard on the constitution as a regular routine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Especially when you had to get up at six or six-thirty the next morning,
                    get on the subway or fight your way through heavy traffic to the office by car.
                    There, waiting for you, would be a good two and one-half inch stack of telegrams
                    which had come in overnight from all over the world. The thing about a place
                    like Paris is that you can't really say, “Indonesia doesn't interest me, so I
                    won't read that.” Countries like France have relationships in all parts of the
                    world, with special interests in Africa and parts of the second and third world.
                    So any of these reports might be or might become important, and at least had to
                    be scanned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these telegrams between another Embassy and the
                        Department that were copied to you, or messages sent especially to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Mostly the former, since telegrams were routinely repeated for
                    information; but also the latter, when someone wanted to comment or supplement
                    one of our reports. Or they might involve a new issue another Embassy wanted to
                    bring to our attention.</p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>Having hurriedly digested all those messages, as well as in-house memos,
                    announcements and what-have-you, it was off to the nine-thirty staff meeting to
                    discuss the issues of the day and agree on next steps as to who would do what,
                    when and why.</p>
                <p>Then there would be a bit of time to draft telegrams, review and sign out memos
                    and messages others had prepared, or go to meetings called by the Ambassador,
                    the DCM or elsewhere in the Embassy. By eleven or so, I would again be off to
                    see someone, perhaps at the Quai, the Elysee, or at another Embassy; or I would
                    meet a key journalist like Michel Tatu, the famous Soviet expert at Le Monde, or
                    even a major intellectual like Raymond Aron (a shrewd realist who was
                    passionately interested in the evolution of the Cold War). Particularly after
                    first contacts had been made, these meetings, more often than not, took place a
                    bit later over lunch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why always lunch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Its what's expected. Just calling on people usually produced little of
                    value. Real relationships in France are established over a good meal and a
                    bottle of wine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't there a cultural difference between Americans and
                        French in this respect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Very much so. It was invariably instructive to watch American government
                    or business people fly in from the States and expect to get their job done in a
                    brisk, efficient meeting. In France it didn't work that way, or at least not
                    well. If you wanted to get to the heart of issues, you had to make real human
                    contact over bread and wine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this happened almost every day?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. What's more, the whole point was not to be hurried. As a result, I
                    usually I didn't get back to the office until two-thirty or three, full of good
                    Burgundy...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: ... and information that should be promptly reported. The trouble was
                    that my secretary, who had had a less splendid lunch in the cafeteria, had been
                    impatiently waiting for me all this time and would make clear that she was
                    leaving at five-thirty no matter what, and warn that if I had something to
                    write, I had better do it quickly!”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0245" n="Page0245"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: So afternoon drafting was usually stressful. Things progressively got
                    worse toward the evening as new piles of telegrams arrived, other colleagues
                    brought their work for clearance or review, and there were unexpected calls to
                    front-office meetings, flaps or visitors.</p>
                <p>By five-thirty or six you are pretty drained. You have had no exercise all day,
                    you have eaten too well and are still processing that half bottle of Burgundy.
                    Then its back home for a bit of time with Christina and Pat, before being off
                    again to the evening's social event. And so the week would go by, until we could
                    escape two or three times a month for weekends in our fresh-air retreats in
                    Normandy or Burgundy</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like a pretty demanding life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It was demanding, but also exhilarating and rewarding. Demanding, because
                    that's what it took to produce the high volume of first-class reporting and
                    analysis required to keep Washington abreast of France's complex interactions
                    and to offer sound recommendations. And rewarding because our collective work
                    often did succeed in pulling important rabbits out of the hat.</p>
                <p>g. French Soviet and Satellite relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's now turn to the work you did on French Soviet and
                        Soviet Bloc relations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: When I arrived in Paris in '75, detente had probably peaked with the
                    signing of the Helsinki Final Act, since - for reasons which are still debated -
                    Moscow's line hardened after that. The 'Brezhnev Doctrine', which had emerged
                    after the Soviet military suppression of the 'Prague spring', hung ominously
                    over the eastern European satellites, which, led by Romania, were increasingly
                    restless and chafing at Moscow's control. At the same time, Moscow's renewed
                    heavy-handedness further disillusioned the Western Communist parties, including
                    the still powerful French CP, who increasingly trended toward 'Euro-Communism' -
                    a new, less rigidly Moscow-controlled, ideological position.</p>
                <pb facs="0246" n="Page0246"/>
                <p>The ideological and political Cold War also continued and in some areas sharpened
                    in the second and third worlds. Moscow's renewed offensive posture was reflected
                    in their military aid to Angola's 'Popular Movement for the Liberation of
                    Angola', and the astonishing appearance there of Cuban troops; in their parallel
                    efforts in Mozambique and the Horn of Africa; as well as in Moscow's push for
                    increased influence in Afghanistan, which culminated in its ill-fated Soviet
                    invasion in 1978. The contest also went on in the Middle East, where Moscow
                    continued to support Syria and the Palestinians. All together, the US and its
                    allies were frustrated by their seeming inability to stem these renewed
                    pressures.</p>
                <p>The picture was further complicated by contradictory developments in the
                    strategic arms race. On the one hand the late seventies saw the deployments in
                    the USSR of the first of what would eventually become over 400 SS-20s, a new
                    MIRVed triple warhead mobile intermediate range ballistic missile aimed at
                    Western Europe. The purpose of this huge new investment, turned out to be
                    Moscow's last, desperate try to 'decouple' Western Europe from the US by raising
                    doubts about the reliability of the American deterrent. The question it meant to
                    raise in Western European minds was, whether we would really launch our ICBM's
                    if Europe were attacked, and so risk Chicago for some European city? And whether
                    they, particularly the Germans, would not be wiser to go neutral.</p>
                <p>By 1977 German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt was concerned enough to raise this issue
                    privately in Washington and in major speeches, an effort which eventually led to
                    NATO's 'dual track' response: First, the counter-deployment of US IRBMs in
                    Western Europe which - after huge public debates in Europe - was begun in '83,
                    and, secondly, the beginning of negotiations to limit medium-range systems.
                    Interestingly, negotiations toward a second SALT agreement continued during the
                    same period, suggesting a certain ambivalence in Moscow's posture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a fair summary. But how about the French part?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: France, unlike Germany, was clearly a player but its frustration as usual
                    was that, in spite of its major roles in the French-German relationship, in the
                    European framework and on the political side of NATO, it was not in the driver
                    seat. I think its fair to say that the French were dependable allies, although,
                    then as later, there was a consistent tendency to try to be a bit ahead of the
                    US through their efforts to have 'special' relations in Moscow, Warsaw and
                    elsewhere, to enhance their importance in the east-west game.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your job was to follow all these issues and
                        developments and analyze things as seen from Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0247" n="Page0247"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. One part of the job was sharing and coordinating analyses of all
                    these ongoing east-west developments and making sure the French government
                    correctly understood and, hopefully, supported what we were thinking. Obviously,
                    things that are now pretty clear in retrospect were much less so as these
                    developments occurred, and all of us were groping to make sense of them. The
                    second part was finding out what the French were up to in Moscow and elsewhere
                    behind the Curtain and, when possible, getting the story from both sides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your task was not only to find out what the French were
                        thinking and doing, but what the Soviets and Eastern Europeans were thinking
                        as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. An example might be a visit by the French Foreign Minister
                    to Moscow. To find out what really happened, I would of course call at the Quai
                    and report what they told me. But to get the whole story, it was usually useful
                    to check further with German and British colleagues, with well-informed
                    journalists who followed Soviet and French policy, like Michel Tatu at Le Monde,
                    and to talk to the Soviets and some of the satellite Embassies. As often as not
                    they would, inadvertently or intentionally, drop a small nugget which could be
                    measured against other information. The result would be a much more nuanced
                    account, with useful clues as to what the French were thinking and trying to
                    accomplish. Over time, I developed and sustained a fairly wide set of
                    relationships with people in the Soviet and Satellite Embassies, which
                    occasionally produced very interesting and sometimes very useful
                    information.</p>
                <p>Things were sometimes more difficult, for example when French President Giscard
                    d'Estaing made one of his periodic trips to Poland to go hunting - he had a
                    special affinity for Poland - and would sometimes remain incommunicado for
                    several days at the Polish Prime Minister's hunting lodge without informing the
                    Quai what was being discussed or what he was doing. People were sometimes
                    seriously worried by this, because he would be literally out of touch and
                    unreachable behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the Poles have always had a traditional affinity for
                        the French since the time of Napoleon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Giscard clearly tried to build on this, partly to gain leverage in
                    Eastern Europe and soften Polish positions, partly because he enjoyed the
                    adventure of escaping from his Presidential cocoon in Paris. What's more, he
                    would commit quite a bit of money to Polish projects on these trips ,
                    expenditures the Quai complained were frivolous and produced few result.</p>
                <p>h. Working with the Station</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0248" n="Page0248"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your contact work with the Soviet bloc people in Paris
                        upset the Embassy or the station?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: On the contrary. In contrast to my experience in Bonn, where relations
                    with the Station were sometimes fractious, the Paris Station Chief came to my
                    office shortly after my arrival to stress that he wanted ours to be a
                    cooperative effort and promised never to undercut me or use me in any way I did
                    not fully understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: And he kept his word. The problem in dealing with Soviet and Eastern
                    European personnel in a cosmopolitan setting like Paris is that all sides are
                    afraid of each other. Nobody is quite sure whom they're dealing with or what
                    their motives are. So the business of making useful contacts was delicate and
                    took patience. I tried to call on and often lunched with many of many
                    counterparts in the Soviet and satellite Embassies. Most of these contacts
                    proved useless or worse. It was sometimes only after six months or a year, after
                    one got to know someone fairly well, that they might began to talk more
                    seriously about actual issues rather than repeating party propaganda.</p>
                <p>I remember a Polish colleague, a pleasant, highly educated man with whom I had
                    many meetings during this period. One day over a particularly pleasant lunch, he
                    said, “Well, George, I think I know you well enough now so we can stop talking
                    poetry!” I said, “We are going to talk about the real world?” He said, “Yes!
                    You're not from the CIA, and I like and trust you. So let's talk reality.” From
                    then on, we had a highly productive relationship, which almost led to his
                    defection, although he decided not to in the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any of your contacts actually defect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. A senior East German diplomat, very bright, informed and
                    disciplined. After months of meeting him occasionally, he said out of the blue
                    one day over lunch: “You know, you're pretty dense. Haven't you figured out that
                    I've invested all this time in you because I want to get out? I have got to a
                    point where I can't wait any longer.” When I got over my surprise I explained
                    that I was the wrong person to talk to. He said, “Yes, I know, but they're a
                    bunch of klutzes, and I don't trust them.” So I said, “I'm going to talk to some
                    people about this, but, in the end, you are still going to have to bite the
                    bullet and deal with them, because I am a diplomat and I can't do this.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0249" n="Page0249"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, he told me to do what I had to and promised to comply. After I had
                    gone over all this with the Station, it was arranged that he and I would have
                    dinner at a famous hotel in Paris, at the end of which I would accompany him for
                    a couple of blocks. He would then have to cross the street on his own and meet
                    someone at a caf�. That was the end of the story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the defection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That was the defection. It worked, but not without some cliffhangers,
                    since, all during dinner he was extremely nervous and twice said he couldn't go
                    through with it, and twice changed his mind. Needless to say, the hotel and the
                    neighborhood through which we walked was swarming with our people to make sure
                    he wasn't kidnapped by his service at the last minute. As it turned out nothing
                    happened, and he presumably made it to a new life in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they know he wasn't a mole or a double agent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That, of course, was the big question. But that was their and certainly
                    not my business. I should add that I never found out what happened to him and
                    what, in the end, he turned out to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any useful contacts at the Soviet Embassy in
                        Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. We knew a number of people there, but I came to have a special
                    friend whom I saw often over the years. After we had gone through the usual
                    feeling-out process, he would welcome going for long walks (no listening
                    devices) during which he discussed the petrified state the USSR under its
                    current gerontocracy and his passionate hope as a Russian patriot that a renewal
                    could be brought about. He made it quite clear that he wasn't interested in
                    defecting or of compromising me with his people, but simply wanted a serious US
                    interlocutor, so that people in Washington would know how things really were and
                    understand that there were many who wanted change. I often asked him if he was
                    not likely to get in trouble. He thought not, because he submitted, I assume,
                    sanitized reports of our conversations to his security people, and had
                    permission to continue to see me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't our security types worried that you might get in
                        trouble?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0250" n="Page0250"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Actually, both my superiors and the Station warmly encouraged me to
                    continue what gradually turned into a real friendship. He and his wife and child
                    came to one of our Thanksgiving dinners and had an absolutely marvelous time. He
                    even invited Pat and myself to visit them once at the Soviet Embassy compound
                    where they all lived and worked, which, as far as was known, no one from our
                    side had ever entered before. We were warmly welcomed in their tiny apartment
                    where a dozen or so of his friends and neighbors in the compound brought cakes
                    and served us tea, and made it clear how pleased they were that we had come! It
                    was all as if a 'Moscow Spring” had just broken out!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did he give you real, valuable in formation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Washington and the Agency certainly thought so. The relationship
                    developed to the point that we began to get very clear readings on problems in
                    Moscow, its views on the French Communist party, evolving relations with Paris
                    etc.. Of course, all this raised questions whether he was a KGB guy assigned to
                    work on me, or a legitimate diplomat and “Russian patriot' as he claimed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think this was really a back channel way to
                        communicate what someone in their government wanted our government to know,
                        without taking responsibility for it? Or was he also passing
                        disinformation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Perhaps it was the former. All I can say is that none of the many
                    telegrams our talks produced were ever challenged by anyone in Washington. On
                    the contrary they again and again received high commendations. That would not
                    have been the case, if some of it had sounded dubious.</p>
                <p>i. Brezhnev's visit to Paris</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you cite an example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: One might be Brezhnev's three day visit to Paris in June 1977 which the
                    French hoped would be a significant success and Washington was keenly interested
                    in. As usual we had all sorts of official briefings from the Quai, talked to
                    various direct and indirect participants and studied Le Monde's and other
                    accounts of what turned out to be a rather unproductive but turbulent visit. To
                    set the tone, Brezhnev broke protocol and summoned some French Ministers to
                    Rambouillet before meeting with President Giscard, didn't like a car the French
                    gave him and met with Paris Mayor Chirac, even though the latter had pointedly
                    been excluded from the schedule.</p>
                <pb facs="0251" n="Page0251"/>
                <p>Conversely he did not meet with French CP chief George Marchais, who publicly
                    wanted to deemphasize his Moscow ties, being now committed to the “Programme
                    Commun” with Francois Mitterrand's Socialists, through which the French left had
                    just decisively won the municipal elections.</p>
                <p>In the end Brezhnev made some meandering public statements saying, inter alia,
                    that US-Soviet relations were in a 'difficult phase” and signed two documents:
                    One on non-proliferation and another on detente, in which Brezhnev accepted,
                    what he had already committed himself to in the Helsinki Final Act, that respect
                    for human rights should be one of the bases for improving French-Soviet
                    relations.</p>
                <p>What I learned from my Soviet friend on an almost real-time basis during the
                    visit was how very poor Brezhnev's health actually was; that he was much more
                    feeble and sick than had generally been realized in the West; was not able to
                    concentrate, drank too much, had to be primed and propped up for every event and
                    helped in and out of buildings, cars and airplanes. We even learned what he had
                    for lunch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've seen that pattern again in more recent times with
                        the Russian leadership in Yeltsin's time..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: We have, except in Brezhnev's case people knew he was not well, but I
                    think they were not certain how debilitated he really was. We received warm
                    commendations for these reports which the Department said had changed
                    Washington's appreciation of Brezhnev's health and therefore had significant
                    implications for US policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which leaves open the question why your friend was so
                        helpful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It is possible that he helped us because, as he said again and again, he
                    was a Russian patriot and wanted us to see clearly what was happening in the
                    Soviet Union. Conversely, it is also conceivable that some faction in Moscow
                    wanted us to know, which would help explain why he seemed to be able to operate
                    with relative impunity. In the end we will probably never know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who, by the way, was the Soviet Ambassador in Paris at the
                        time? Did you ever meet him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0252" n="Page0252"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Stepan Chervonenko, the hard liner who had presided over the Soviet
                    invasion of Czechoslovakia, whom I met once. It happened when Art Hartman phoned
                    me one afternoon to ask if Pat and I would join him and Donna at a dinner at the
                    Soviet Ambassador's where they had been invited. The last time the Hartmans had
                    been there, he said, the ratio was a dozen Soviets to two Americans. That was
                    heavy lifting. Art thought if four of us went we should be able to handle them.
                    He was prescient.</p>
                <p>Although obviously interesting, it turned out to be the gloomiest evening we had
                    spent in Paris, beginning with the Soviet hatcheck girl, who made it clear that
                    she was being watched and that even a word of small talk was unwelcome; to the
                    cavernous reception room where a solemn Chervonenko dourly welcomed us and
                    promptly engaged Ambassador Hartman in earnest conversation - with the predicted
                    dozen Soviet staffers clustering around to hear what was being said; and finally
                    to truly ghastly sturgeon dinner, served in solemn Victorian fashion - so bad,
                    that Pat said afterwards that the sturgeon must have walked all the way from
                    Vladivostok. As for substance, we went through the catalogue of standard
                    exchanges before and during dinner, toasted each other several times with the
                    obligatory vodka, and finally went home having survived but learned little.</p>
                <p>j. The French Communist Party</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You earlier mentioned George Marchais. What about the
                        French Communist Party in those years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The whole question of the French Left, both the massive Communist party
                    and, to a lesser extent, the Socialists, had been at the center of American
                    concern since World War II. In my time in Paris the French Communist Party was
                    still an extremely disciplined, centrally managed, quite powerful force in
                    French politics, able to attract over 20% of the popular vote.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And slavishly pro-Soviet?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0253" n="Page0253"/>
                <p>JAEGER: That was less clear since the formation of the 'Programme Commun' with
                    the Socialists in 1972 and the growing influence of 'Euro-Communism'. Successive
                    shocks and revelations, from Khrushchev's secret speech, the Czech invasion and
                    particularly the publication of Solzhenitsyn's sensational 'Gulag Archipelago'
                    in '73, had had a huge impact and shaken the European Communist parties -
                    especially the Italians. Although the French CP had rejected 'Euro-communism'
                    for longer than anyone , even they had to bend to the wind at their party
                    Congress in '76, at which they dropped the concept of the 'dictatorship of the
                    proletariat' and moved somewhat closer to Euro-communist positions. Even so,
                    this was a qualified shift motivated by fear of losing voter appeal rather than
                    changing convictions, since, only three years later, the French CP loyally
                    approved the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan - as they had supported the invasion
                    of Czechoslovakia some years earlier.</p>
                <p>That said, understanding the French Communist Party, and its relationships with
                    Moscow remained one of the most difficult and important issues for us. While not
                    a vital threat, as they had been after World War II, they could still turn out
                    massive numbers of people to demonstrate in Paris and across France and were
                    obviously a crucial factor in France's electoral equation. The frustrating thing
                    was that we were able to get only fragmentary insights into what was going on
                    inside the party or about its Moscow relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you try to sum it up for us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: On the one hand, it was clear that the French party chafed under Moscow's
                    control and tried to conceal the directives it received dictating their
                    behavior. What's more it did show some independence, as when Marchais avoided
                    meeting Brezhnev during his visit when their lines increasingly diverged.</p>
                <p>Even so, I remember being at the Soviet Embassy on their National Day around this
                    time and seeing a totally relaxed and jovial George Marchais being received as a
                    most honored guest, clearly enjoying himself and looking very much 'at home'.
                    Indeed the leading French CP people were continually seen at the Soviet Embassy
                    which had a full-time officer assigned to liaise with them. It is more than
                    likely that the Soviets themselves may have pragmatically accepted the necessity
                    of a little public disloyalty for electoral and political reasons, while trying
                    to preserve the essential relationship behind the scenes, which remained one of
                    their major assets on the French and European scenes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to follow any of this in detail?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0254" n="Page0254"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Let's say, we managed to get a certain degree of insight for a period of
                    time. Part of this came from John Dobrin's high-level contacts with the
                    Socialists, part from mine and part from other sources. Since Washington was
                    intensely concerned that a possible 'Programme Commun' government would
                    necessarily include French Communist ministers, it was important to understand
                    to what degree Moscow would gain influence and so obtain a window into the
                    Western alliance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the CP pushing at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: One of their projects was for a Soviet-French friendship treaty, a theme
                    which also had a certain limited appeal to extreme Gaullists opposed to NATO and
                    some others frightened by the continuing 'balance of terror'. Even so, it was
                    clearly a non-starter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that would have been consistent with de Gaulle's
                        signing of a war-time Friendship treaty with the Soviets in 1944?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, but in Giscard d'Estaing's world in the late seventies it was out of
                    the question. I also learned early on that the Soviets were unsuccessfully
                    pressing for separate and far reaching French-Soviet disarmament agreements.
                    While Giscard wanted a prominent French role in the Western alliance, breaking
                    ranks altogether in any of these ways was not in the cards.</p>
                <p>France under Giscard, was in the vanguard of detente, with annual summits with
                    the USSR, but he sought detente in the context of a strengthening French role in
                    the European context and improvements in French-US relations.</p>
                <p>k. Lunch with Mitterrand</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we turn for a moment to Mitterrand and the
                        'Programme Commun”. Could you set the stage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The 'Programme Commun', roughly translatable as the 'Common Program', was
                    signed by the Socialists, the French PC and the Left Radicals in 1972 to regain
                    momentum in view of the continued predominance of the Gaullists after the
                    political crisis of 1958. That this sharp turn to the left was a winning
                    strategy became evident in the presidential elections of '74 when Mitterrand's
                    'Union of the Left' lost only narrowly to Giscard; and even more so when it won
                    the mid-term municipal elections in 1977, mentioned earlier, which were seen as
                    the run-up for legislative elections to be held in '78.</p>
                <pb facs="0255" n="Page0255"/>
                <p>Given this increasing success, there was growing concern in Washington that the
                    'Union of the Left' might then gain control of the French National Assembly and
                    form a government - raising the specter of Communist Ministers in power in a
                    Mitterrand cabinet able to influence French foreign and security policy and get
                    access to sensitive military and intelligence information. How to deal with this
                    and the possibility that the 'Union of the Left' might, worse still, gain the
                    Presidency in 1981, became a major Washington concern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Embassy deal with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: One obvious first step, was to get to know Mitterrand a little better.
                    John Dobrin, the Political Section's gifted 'enfant terrible' had come to know
                    him informally as leader of the Socialist Party, and he and Hank Cohen conveyed
                    some of these concerns, of which Mitterrand was, of course, aware. His response
                    was an informal commitment that Communist Ministers in any future government of
                    the left would not be given access to this kind of sensitive information. So far
                    so good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's nice, but...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Right. We then evolved the notion that maybe we should invite Mitterrand
                    to lunch with Ambassador Rush to emphasize our concerns more formally and create
                    a closer relationship; Mitterrand and others on the left having long been in the
                    Embassy's and Washington's official deep freeze, with official contact largely
                    limited to Dobrin's Second Secretary level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Mitterrand accept?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: With alacrity, but one, on the face of it, quite reasonable condition.
                    “If”, Mitterrand replied, “I am going to be head of a government or President of
                    France, I need to be read into the real strategic situation.” In short, his
                    price for coming to lunch was a comprehensive, highly classified briefing on the
                    state of the nuclear and strategic east-west situation. That, of course created
                    an immediate problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much you are going to tell Mitterrand ...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0256" n="Page0256"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Precisely. At the same time, Mitterrand, and his people reiterated that a
                    government of the 'Union of the Left' would share power and information with the
                    Communists only on French domestic issues, and that the Communists would be
                    hermetically sealed off from foreign and security affairs. We had his word that
                    he would protect Allied interests and clearly understood the problems posed for
                    America and France's NATO and European allies by the French Communists'
                    relationship with Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how was this resolved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The issue precipitated telegraphic exchanges with Washington over nine
                    months, an endless back and forth which only underscored Washington's distrust
                    Mitterrand. At the same time, everyone was aware of the other horn of dilemma,
                    that the US might soon be dealing with him as head of government or even
                    President of France, and that rebuffing him would be a bad start for this
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>In the end Washington waffled. An elegant little outdoor lunch was arranged on
                    the terrace of the Ambassador's residence with beautiful food and great French
                    wines. Mitterrand came, said little and was very polite. After lunch a lowly
                    Lieutenant Colonel (!) gave a 'secret' half hour briefing on the strategic
                    situation, with the usual maps and paraphernalia, which was in fact just a
                    standard, unclassified rundown. Mitterrand might as well have read the New York
                    Times!</p>
                <p>Although he left with the unfortunate impression that he was still not trusted,
                    the lunch was not a total loss. For it was Mitterrand's first-ever visit to the
                    Embassy and so symbolically important in itself. Moreover, it gave him the
                    opportunity to tell Ambassador Rush on the record how, if elected, he would
                    conduct his government and to stress again that America had nothing to fear.</p>
                <p>My own feeling, then and later, was that by delaying this meeting for nine
                    months, and then serving him lukewarm gruel, we failed to seize an opportunity.
                    As it turned out, when Mitterrand was finally elected President in 1981, albeit
                    without Communist participation, he turned out to be a pillar of continuity in
                    foreign affairs and was rather tough on Moscow, even though his domestic
                    policies of nationalization of industries roiled French and other waters.</p>
                <p>l. Elysee Relations</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another piece of the Paris puzzle is the Elysee. How were
                        the Embassy's relations with the Presidency during your time in Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0257" n="Page0257"/>
                <p>JAEGER: I am glad you asked. I began to realize early in my assignment that our
                    relations with the �lys�e were very, very thin. Ambassador Rush had virtually no
                    substantive contact with Giscard. Hank Cohen did occasionally see the head of
                    Giscard's tiny, but very influential foreign affairs staff of six or seven - a
                    pleasant man, given to sport coats and country house manners, who invariably
                    gave him a polite half hour but, as Hank kept saying, produced little that was
                    worth reporting. This was a real problem, since the Elysee often kept the Quai
                    in the dark as well, leaving us only partially informed and with little
                    influence at highest level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, time went by and eventually Hank Cohen and I decided that I should
                    have a go at the 'working level' of that staff. After thinking about this for
                    some time, I settled on the youngest member of the Elysee staff, Jean-David
                    Levitt. At thirty he was a rising star among France's junior diplomats and,
                    although very junior, reportedly had Giscard's confidence.</p>
                <p>The next problem was how to make effective contact. I found out that one of his
                    minor duties was to follow Andorra issues...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: .. because the President France, together with the Catalan Bishop of
                    Urgell, is one of the 'two co-princes' of Andorra - an odd arrangement which
                    goes back to the 13th century.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: So, on September 8, 1977, Pat and I decided to help celebrate Andorra
                    National Day and, as expected, found Jean-David Levitt in attendance, standing
                    in for Co-Prince Giscard. We met, hit it off, and agreed to an early lunch, at
                    which I deplored the rather spotty relationship between the Embassy and the
                    Elysee. Levitt fully agreed, but then said, “If we work together, can you
                    deliver?”</p>
                <p>I knew exactly what he meant. If we established an informal channel to Giscard,
                    would Washington respond with equal seriousness at the highest levels? I took an
                    enormous chance and said “Yes, I can.” Levitt said, “Fine. Now what would you
                    like to know?” Well, I said, “I have five questions,” and asked for the Elysee's
                    view on five top-flight issues of the day.</p>
                <p>He said, “I'll be in touch.”</p>
                <pb facs="0258" n="Page0258"/>
                <p>By 3:30PM that afternoon my phone rang, and there was Levitt: “The answers to
                    your questions are ....” and rattled off succinct replies to my five questions.
                    When he had finished he proposed that we have lunch again next week “when I will
                    ask you several questions.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had your channel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. Levitt had evidently seen Giscard after our lunch, and phoned me his
                    answers to my questions! So far so good!</p>
                <p>The next problem was, of course, to get Washington to respond appropriately.
                    Well, I prepared a highly classified and very restricted message 'for the
                    Secretary and the White House only', explaining that we had succeeded in
                    establishing a backchannel to Giscard; reporting his responses to our initial
                    questions, some of which had far-reaching implications, and making clear that
                    this arrangement would work only as long as we were able to respond to their
                    questions promptly and with equally authoritative highest-level answers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Big time stuff!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, yes. I took my draft telegram to Sam Gammon, the able Deputy Chief
                    of Mission who was then Charg�, who had not heard of any of this before and was
                    clearly taken aback: “You know, if this isn't for real, its not just your job
                    but also mine! You really want me to sign this? How do we know this guy is
                    responsible?” I said, “Sam, you don't know, but, I think, it's the best source
                    you're ever going to get. My recommendation is that you sign it, and let's see
                    what happens.” To his great credit he did. After some high level back and forth
                    with Washington, our new channel worked effectively until I left Paris and
                    resolved some important misunderstandings between Washington and Paris.</p>

                <p>JAEGER: Well, it undoubtedly helped with my promotion to FSO-2 and the Senior
                    Foreign Service after I got back to Washington. But I recount this, not in
                    self-praise, but because it's an important case study of how, finding the right
                    person at the right level, making real human contact and then playing it
                    absolutely straight, can overcome major systemic roadblocks and open the way to
                    genuine communication - the critical prerequisite to effective diplomacy.</p>
                <p>Too often people think you have to rely on cloak and dagger stuff, when its all
                    there to be had with a little imagination, drive and that indefinable quality
                    necessary to make genuine human contacts - even between adversaries.</p>

                        the highest level in France realized that they had a channel they could use

                <p>JAEGER: Precisely. It was an official unofficial channel. The footnote to this

                    Ambassador to the US during George W. Bush's Presidency, then served as French
                    Ambassador to the UN and, as I edit this account, has returned to his old haunts

                </p>
                <p>i. Portugal</p>
                <p>JAEGER: My bit-part in the Portuguese drama of the seventies began one day in
                    1976, when I received a call from the Portuguese Ambassador to France, Antonio
                    Coimbra Martins, asking if he could come to see me. I demurred and suggested he
                    might want to see Ambassador Rush. Martins said he had, and repeated that he
                    wanted to meet with me. It was the beginning of a wonderful personal and
                    political relationship.</p>
                <p>Martins - a brilliant Romance literature scholar and close friend of Prime
                    Minister Mario Soares whose Socialist party had just prevailed in the April
                    elections of that year - came promptly, sat on the hard chair next to my scuffed
                    desk and explained that he needed a friend in the Embassy who would help support
                    Soares' and Ambassador Frank Carlucci's struggle to stabilize his country by
                    persuading the French government to be more supportive. He had tried to explain
                    this to our Ambassador, who had not seemed deeply interested and had suggested
                    he meet with me!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Amazing! Sketch in the background of what was happening in
                        Portugal to set the stage, OK?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0260" n="Page0260"/>
                <p>JAEGER: The background was dramatic. After the collapse of the Portuguese
                    colonies and the fall of Portugal's authoritarian regime a left-leaning military
                    coup failed to contain the deepening crisis and the Moscow-guided Portuguese
                    Communist Party remained a powerful destabilizing influence and threatened to
                    make Portugal the first Communist country in Western Europe. By '76, Mario
                    Soares and his moderate-left Socialists had managed to win legislative elections
                    and form a weak government but were endangered by Portugal's profound poverty
                    and discontent. To visualize the situation you have to keep in mind that the
                    average Portuguese standard of living in those days was at the level of an
                    African country!</p>
                <p>Kissinger had at first written Soares off as the 'Kerensky' of Portugal, the guy
                    who would just be the front-runner for the Moscow-controlled Communists when he
                    failed. Carlucci eventually persuaded Henry to be supportive, enabling him to
                    undergird Soares' government with aid, loans, new military programs and strong
                    public support. Carlucci's compelling point, which was the main theme of the
                    gusher of telegrams from Lisbon, was that there was no alternative to Soares. So
                    he worked like a tiger to assure Soares' survival and success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what did the Portuguese Ambassador want you to
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: In brief, to help persuade the French to be more generous and to untie
                    French assistance from the usual conditions that any resulting business had to
                    go to French firms. Moreover, France, then as now, had a special relationship
                    with Spain and Portugal, both being Mediterranean countries and neighbors. It
                    was specially important, therefore, that effective support for Soares come, and
                    be seen as coming, not only from the US but also from Portugal's European
                    neighbors, particularly France. Soares saw this as Martins' principal task.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, if I remember correctly, the Germans were more
                        supportive of the Portuguese socialists than the French.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. In France, the Giscard government, indeed the whole right
                    wing of the French political spectrum, was not at all happy about the socialist
                    direction of events in Portugal, and were therefore holding back. For Soares and
                    Martins it was critical to reassure the French and show them how much worse
                    things could get if they didn't help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to help?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0261" n="Page0261"/>
                <p>JAEGER: In the end yes. The Portuguese desk officer at the Quai was an austere,
                    rather difficult woman who seemed like an impenetrable wall. I took up the cause
                    and made many trips to the Quai, cajoling and pleading Soares' cause at various
                    levels, making it clear that this was a major American priority. In the end,
                    after months of effort, we made headway and were able to report to Carlucci and
                    the Department that the French had untied and increased some of their aid and
                    were being generally more helpful. Even so it remained hard for the French
                    government to help ideological opponents in Lisbon who were friends of
                    Mitterrand. It was a tough, uphill fight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's fascinating. I don't think I told you about my own
                        acquaintance with Portugal in those days. Because of my interest in the
                        comparative history of revolution, we went there in June of '75. By that
                        time, as you have described, the revolution was going through the
                        characteristic phase of being radicalized, with radical officers in the
                        military, who had come out of Africa, becoming the dominant political force.
                        They were backed, at a certain distance by the Russians and the Communist
                        Party. Thanks to the Embassy we got passes to the opening session of the
                        newly elected constituent assembly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I was, of course, comparing this with the constituent assembly that met in Russia
                    in January 1918 and was dispersed by Lenin. Well, in this case, it was not.
                    Following the session, when the delegates left the building, which was
                    surrounded by armored cars for security purposes, I saw Soares talking with a
                    group of people and went up and introduced myself and explained that I was an
                    American historian interested in revolutions, and could we meet? He said,
                    “Tomorrow.” So my wife and I went to his office in the Parliament building. At
                    the time he was a minister without portfolio in the military government. And, of
                    course, it was touch and go as to whether he would be thrown out or become prime
                    minister. In our meeting he also recounted his meeting with Kissinger at which
                    Kissinger told him, as you said, that, “maybe you're going to be the Kerensky of
                    the Portuguese revolution. “Well”, Soares said he replied. “ Kerensky didn't do
                    so badly. He became a college professor in the United States!” I thought he was
                    a very honorable man, who was desperately trying to steer between the forces of
                    right and left that were threatening Portugal at the time.</p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. And it was Carlucci's great merit that he clearly
                    understood the importance of this and mobilized all possible resources to help,
                    of which my efforts in Paris were a minor part.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0262" n="Page0262"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. We happened to encounter Soares again the following
                        year. By that time the psychological atmosphere had changed completely.
                        There was a distinct thermidorian reaction. Exactly the same thing George
                        Orwell described in his book on 'Catalonia' after the anarchists were
                        crushed in Barcelona. Well, in Portugal there had been this ultra-left
                        uprising in Lisbon in November of '75, the collapse. The Communists
                        distanced themselves from it. Soares then made his tremendous comeback and
                        won the parliamentary election in '76! Glad you were able to help a bit
                        after that!</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other issues came up in Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The Political Section, when in my last year or so I was Deputy Counselor
                    and floor manager, had to deal with an almost endless list of issues in Europe
                    and across the globe: Arms control and Helsinki follow-up, French-German
                    relations and European community developments. There was the endless fuss
                    between Greece and Turkey, various problems in the Middle East, Morocco and
                    Algeria as well as former French Africa which the French were very neuralgic
                    about. My colleague Mark Pratt presided over the Far Eastern issues, Japan,
                    Taiwan, China and Indonesia, but particularly Cambodia and Vietnam. There was no
                    end of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Paris really had some of the most complex tasks of any
                        of our embassies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, much like all the great embassies, London, Paris, Tokyo, Moscow,
                    now Berlin, where all the hubs come together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit more of some of the off beat problems
                        which you worked on personally.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I remember spending considerable time on problems involving Svalbard, the
                    island archipelago north of Norway, governed by Norway under the terms of the
                    1920 Svalbard treaty, where suspicious Soviet activities near their mining town
                    were raising red flags in Washington, Oslo and NATO.</p>
                <p>The there was Cyprus, and the never-ceasing Greek-Turkish problems, which became
                    a particularly persistent theme in the aftermath of the '74 invasion. I worked
                    closely with the British Embassy on peace initiatives then underway and often
                    shared reports and analyses. One of the things which struck me at the time was
                    that, although their political staff was a third the size of ours, they managed
                    somehow to handle the same range of issues as our much larger staff.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't that rather characteristic of American efforts
                        compared with some Europeans who often do almost as well with a lot fewer
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, although there are distinctions. The Brits tend to produce people
                    who write concisely and do things with an economy of means, perhaps as a result
                    of their tutorial system in Universities. I saw this again when I was heading
                    the Political Department at NATO, where my British colleague was as productive
                    as most of the rest of the staff put together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Don't the French do this too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The French view things through a logical prism, the Cartesian method
                    taught in the 'Grands Ecoles'. The Brits tend to begin with concise perceptions
                    of reality and then think their way through to policy conclusions, as we do,
                    except we tend to need more paper and more words.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Berlin still on the front burner when you were in
                        Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Berlin too continued to take much time, since France was one of the four
                    occupying powers. My interlocutor at the Quai was Francois Plaisant, the
                    Director of Berlin affairs, a smallish man whose bangs stretched across his
                    forehead concealed a very bright and somewhat stubborn mind.</p>
                <p>I remember frequent meetings with Plaisant in which we tried to coordinate Allied
                    positions, which could be difficult. One rather technical Berlin issue comes to
                    mind, on which Plaisant had taken a hard position which our people in Berlin and
                    the Department badly wanted to change. I met with Plaisant at least four times
                    and presented our arguments as persuasively as I could. When I gave it one more
                    try and had again gone over the whole thing, he smiled a little and said, Ok, if
                    its that important I'll meet you half way, not because you have persuaded us but
                    because you are a friend and you really want this - which again illustrates the
                    importance of genuine human contact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he able to make decisions for the French

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: On most of these issues yes. Plaisant was Mr. Berlin at the Quai. The
                    Director for Europe, Jacques Andr�ani was no doubt kept informed and
                    consulted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One thinks of the French as so bureaucratic and

                <pb facs="0264" n="Page0264"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, but Office Directors at the Quai, at least in my time, were powerful
                    people who almost always became ambassadors on their next foreign assignment,
                    like my friend Yves Omnes, the Director for Soviet and Eastern European Affairs,
                    who became French Ambassador in Egypt. They no doubt cleared their decisions,
                    but were very influential.</p>

                <p>JAEGER: He came to Paris frequently, sometimes on Vietnam matters, sometimes to
                    see Giscard d'Estaing and whoever was Foreign Minister at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see him on these visits? I remember you had known
                        him at Harvard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Only once - since he never came to the Chancery - although that proved to
                    be rather memorable. I was the senior Embassy duty officer, which meant being
                    available at the Ambassador's residence at rue Saint Honor� where Henry always
                    stayed to help with whatever issues might come up, i.e. late-night contact with
                    someone in the French government etc..</p>
                <p>The scene was the residence's vast lobby, where duplicate arrays of copying
                    machines, multiple typewriters and desks had been set up in somewhat
                    surrealistic readiness for the arrival of “the aircraft”, expected about ten PM,
                    but then delayed. At nearly midnight the doors burst open with a crack, and
                    Henry, followed by a phalanx of assistants and staffers, burst in. Ambassador
                    Rush stood in the middle of the hall to welcome Henry and offered him a drink.
                    Henry, didn't even break his stride, perfunctorily shook Rush's hand and was off
                    to his and Nancy's rooms. Poor Rush mumbled something like , “Well, welcome to
                    Paris,” and disappeared as well, while Henry's platoon of assistants, who had
                    all brought along whatever they had been working on on the aircraft, set to
                    typing away furiously on important papers.</p>
                <p>I was at my little desk awaiting developments, when the very bright-looking young
                    woman with blonde bangs and sharp blue eyes who was Henry's secretary, picked up
                    her phone, took a message, looked at me, and said, “He wants the paper.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Today is Sunday, and there isn't a paper. There's just a weekend edition
                    of the Herald Tribune, which was published early yesterday morning.” Goldilocks,
                    as I nicknamed her in retrospect, was unamused: “Don't be stupid! He wants the
                    paper! Get the paper!”</p>
                <pb facs="0265" n="Page0265"/>
                <p>So I called the Chief Housekeeper, a wonderfully kind and competent lady, and
                    asked if there was a copy of the weekend Herald Tribune. She called back a
                    moment later in some considerable distress and said, “The Ambassador has gone to
                    bed, and is, I think, doing the crossword puzzle.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I said, “Mr. Kissinger's Assistant here says that he wants the paper.”
                    She said, “Well, if its really necessary, I'll try to talk to the Ambassador.”
                    After a few minutes the Chief Housekeeper appeared in person, looking very
                    distressed, and said, “The Ambassador hasn't finished with the crossword puzzle
                    yet, ....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (Laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: .... and wonders if Mr. Kissinger could wait for 20 minutes?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't believe it!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I turned to 'Goldilocks' and explained the situation. She looked at me
                    while continuing to type at an alarming rate, and said, “When Henry wants a
                    paper, Henry gets a paper. GET IT!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: So a few minutes later, out comes this crumpled Herald Tribune with a
                    half-done crossword puzzle that had been taken away from the American Ambassador
                    in Paris so that Henry could read the paper.</p>
                <p>Things turned out quite differently on another occasion when I was asked to help
                    with Brzezinski's arrival at Orly airport. On the way into Paris, there was a
                    loud pop emanating from Zbig's newly armored car followed by several others, at
                    which point his limousine seemed to sink into the ground as it came to a stop.
                    It seems our admin people had forgotten to put heavier tires on the car to
                    compensate for its additional weight! Zbig was, of course, quickly and safely
                    transferred to one of the other cars and sped into town.</p>
                <p>Stories like these about high-level visitors and the endless Congressional
                    delegations who turned up in Paris, and required much time and effort, could
                    fill volumes.</p>

                <p>iv. Carter Visit - Stolen rugs and Security Threats</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about President Carter? Did he visit France during
                        your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, in January 1978, part of a swing which began in Poland, and then
                    took the President through Iran, India, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. I was asked to
                    help our Minister, Sam Gammon, to coordinate the visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the preparations as intense and time consuming as one
                        hears?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: If anything more so. There were, of course, endless planning meetings in
                    the Embassy and with the French, as well as major challenges - such as arranging
                    housing for the 200-some official support staff and all the journalists
                    traveling with the President in one place. I remember startling the General
                    Manager of the Meridian Hotel when I told him that I needed to rent his whole
                    500 room hotel for Carter's visit, and succeeded only after the Elysee kindly
                    supported my request.</p>
                <p>Weeks before the visit a Secret Service detail had, of course, appeared, followed
                    by a huge Advance Group from the White House which virtually took over the
                    Embassy. Between them they looked at every aspect of the visit in painstaking
                    detail, including the routes Carter would travel, the prevailing security
                    situation and, of course, the apartment the Carters would occupy at Giscard's
                    official country retreat, the Chateau of Fontainebleau.</p>
                <p>It was this apartment which gave rise to the first major incident. Our
                    counterpart at the Elysee phoned me a few days before Carter's arrival in great
                    agitation to say that the Americans were stealing President Giscard's rugs and
                    adamantly refused to return them! He had not yet told President Giscard but very
                    much hoped I could promptly get this straightened out!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Incredible!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I sent a rocket to our White House liaison officer who established that
                    the Secret Service team casing Fontainebleau thought the rugs in the apartment
                    the Carters would be staying in were not as nice as others they seen in a nearby
                    suite, and claimed not to have understood the loud complaints emanating from
                    Giscard's staff - since they were speaking French! I made it clear that the rugs
                    were to be returned instantly, and asked our Minister to convey the US
                    Government's profound apologies. The French were kind enough to make sure that
                    the story did not get to the press, which would have destroyed the visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0267" n="Page0267"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said this was the first major incident. What else
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, a few days before Carter's arrival the operator rang me to say
                    there was someone on the line who wanted to report a death threat to the
                    President. When I picked up, a man speaking French explained that he knew of an
                    assassination plot and wanted to warn us, but then refused to explain anything
                    further on the phone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a major problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I told him it was terribly important that we meet either at the Embassy
                    or elsewhere, that he could trust me and that we would do everything in our
                    power to protect the President. The caller would only agree to think about it
                    before he hung up without providing contact information. He then called back two
                    or three times, which was reassuring, and after more conversation, finally
                    agreed to come to the Embassy the following day. He insisted, however, that he
                    only wanted to meet me since he said he didn't trust anybody else.</p>
                <p>I reported all this to the Secret Service, who thought that I was in no way
                    qualified to deal with the situation and informed me that they would now take it
                    over. I said, “Well, this guy said he will only deal with me. What's more, none
                    of you speak French. If we switch signals on him and he refuses to talk, it will
                    be your responsibility if things go wrong.”</p>
                <p>They thought about this and said. “Okay, we'll put a listening device in your
                    desk because we do want to know word for word what he says, and want a
                    recording.” So they installed an expensive looking tape recorder in my desk
                    drawer and attached a red button under the edge of my desk. My instructions were
                    that as soon as he started to talk I was to press the red button which would
                    start the recording.</p>
                <p>Sure enough, the man came, a small rather innocuous-looking person, and was shown
                    to my office. When he was about to sit down and start talking, I pressed the red
                    button - and guess what happened?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: There was a big BANG and a cloud of smoke shot up over my desk!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: They had installed a US specs recorder not realizing that in France the
                    voltage is 220!</p>
                <pb facs="0268" n="Page0268"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: While I was still trying to collect my wits, my little friend was out the
                    door like a shot, down the stairs and out of the building before anybody could
                    get hold of him! As a result, we never found out whether there was a threat or
                    not, which left everyone rather nervous and then greatly relieved when the visit
                    unfolded without incident!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow! Clearly a nut-case, but you couldn't have known that
                        at the time. Tell us now about the actual visit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>v. Carter at Versailles</p>
                <p>JAEGER: Giscard d'Estaing wanted Carter's visit to be a special occasion and had
                    decided to use the just restored Palais de Versailles for the official
                    reception, a first since the Revolution! Because he thought of Carter as a
                    populist he had invited 500 people drawn from all social classes and professions
                    from all over France, besides the usual government ministers, the diplomatic
                    corps and other notables.</p>
                <p>When the guests arrived at the great courtyard of Versailles, illuminated only by
                    flickering torches, they were ushered through a dramatic defile of 'Garde
                    Republicaines', sitting their horses with sabers drawn in salute, the torchlight
                    glittering on breastplates and helmets. The only quixotic touch in this tableau
                    was the lone guardsman urgently running around behind the ranks of horses with a
                    pooper- scooper ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: ... to make sure that the occasion would not be marred by an equestrian
                    mishap!</p>
                <p>Once inside, we saw Versailles at its historic best - the Hall of Mirrors and all
                    the subsequent reception rooms sparkling in candle light, were decorated with
                    vast flower arrangements skillfully matching the mood and colors of each room.
                    There were small clusters of musicians here and there in period costumes softly
                    playing flutes, harps or violins. And there were 'oyster trees' and other
                    opulent and ingenious displays of food and drink for the eventual delectation of
                    France's guests.</p>
                <pb facs="0269" n="Page0269"/>
                <p>To provide structure, the 500 public representatives Giscard had invited were all
                    gathered in the hall of Mirrors. The rest of us were variously led to other
                    reception rooms, the ambassadors to one, the ministers to another, those of us
                    of less exalted rank to a third, and less easily definable invitees were ushered
                    to a fourth. It was all like a great fairy tale, extravagant, shimmering, and,
                    for Pat and myself, somewhat overwhelming.</p>
                <p>After some time had passed, more and more people commented on the fact that the
                    two Presidents had not yet arrived, and were clearly late. What's more protocol
                    demanded that no one could eat or drink until the two Presidents had walked
                    through the reception rooms and greeted everybody, at which point the party
                    could officially begin.</p>
                <p>Alas, more time went by, everyone was increasingly hungry, feet began to hurt
                    because no seating was provided and the question became more urgent: Where were
                    the two Presidents? Had anything happened?</p>
                <p>Finally, well after eleven PM, Carter and Giscard arrived, jovially passed
                    through the salons shaking hands, stopping here and there for a word or two,
                    clearly enjoying each other's company and savoring the event. We later found out
                    what had happened. President Carter had arrived on schedule, but, as he was
                    being taken for a quick drive around the gardens and illuminated fountains of
                    Versailles, the two Presidents became totally engrossed in a long private
                    conversation - we never found out what it was about - while their limousine just
                    continued to drive around the gardens - for almost two hours!</p>
                <p>The evening was nevertheless a great success, even though none of us had a drink
                    or even a tiny canap� until it was almost time to return home, again passing
                    through the ranks of glittering horsemen who were still solemnly on guard in the
                    courtyard when we left.</p>
                <p>n. A last visit to Vienna.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other events which should be recorded?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, I do want to say a word about my father's rather remarkable good-bye
                    to Vienna. Since my mother's death he had been living alone in Kansas City, was
                    increasingly frail but surrounded by a circle of friends who admired him and his
                    paintings, appreciated his willingness to give art lessons to their youngsters,
                    and helped him in all kinds of ways. One day, I think it was in my second year
                    in Paris, I received a letter from him saying that he wanted to make one last
                    visit to Vienna to “forgive these people”! Would I therefore take a ten day
                    leave and come with him, since he was too weak to go alone.</p>
                <pb facs="0270" n="Page0270"/>
                <p>So we did. We flew to Vienna and had a wonderful time together visiting all his
                    old haunts, going to concerts, the theater and even to Grinzing, the famous
                    village in the hilly vineyards above the city where we spent a typical Viennese
                    evening over a happy dinner and a few glasses of white wine. He returned to
                    America at peace, having made this remarkable gesture of reconciling himself
                    with a people who had so enthusiastically welcomed Hitler, cheered, or at least
                    remained silent over the expulsion and death of many thousands of their Jewish
                    fellow citizens, and who had so disrupted his own life. As he said in the end,
                    it was the Christian thing to do. He lived on in Kansas City, cared for largely
                    by his many friends, until he too died on January 11, 1980.</p>
                <p>There was a personal revelation during this trip for me as well. Among the places
                    we visited was my old grade school, the 'Volkschule' where I had learned to read
                    and write. When we explained that I had been a student there for four years,
                    until 1936, the teacher who had admitted us went white as a sheet. “That's
                    impossible”, he said, “they are all dead. That whole class died at Stalingrad!
                    They were all drafted and thrown into that battle when they were 16 and 17.
                    “</p>
                <p>He was amazed and glad to learn that I was the only exception, having been saved
                    by my two Jewish grand parents and my emigration to England and America from the
                    disaster which awaited my Aryan schoolmates in the Hitler youth.</p>
                <p>Life is sometimes very strange, and I was again and again very very lucky!</p>
                <p>o. Leaving Paris</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What a story! And what a tour in Paris. Were you sorry to
                        leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: In a way yes, since it had been the richest and most rewarding assignment
                    so far. We had worked hard, had made many friends and felt that we had
                    succeeded, both in providing high-quality political reporting and in leaving the
                    Political Section in much better shape than it was when I arrived. The icing on
                    the cake was that Art Hartman had warmly recommended me for a 'Superior Honor
                    Award' for my service in France, a distinction which in those days was still
                    something special.</p>
                <p>The evening before we left, the two Lyonnais owners of our favorite small
                    restaurant, the 'Bellecour' on the rue Surcouf, where I had had so many of my
                    business lunches and Pat and I had often gone to mark family events, offered us
                    a truly magnificent good-bye dinner - a splendid, happy seven course affair with
                    all sorts of wonderful Burgundies to match. On our way back to our pre-departure
                    quarters at the Intercontinental Pat and I danced across the footbridge over the
                    Seine, with moonlit Paris shimmering romantically in the waves. It was the
                    perfect ending of a richly rewarding adventure in our lives.</p>

                <p>1. Memorizing the Czech pinball machine</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paris must have been hard to top. What was the next
                        chapter to be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: After some back and forth - there was discussion of a small African
                    Embassy which never materialized - I was assigned to be Deputy Chief of Mission
                    in Prague under Ambassador Thomas R. Byrne, a Ford appointee and longtime labor
                    negotiator close to the CIO's George Meany, who had served as Labor Attach� in
                    London and been Ambassador to Norway.</p>
                <p>As personnel explained it, the Department wanted somebody with more substantial
                    east-west relations experience to backstop Byrne in Prague since Czech relations
                    with the West seemed to be entering a more active phase after being in deep
                    freeze for the previous ten years, since the Soviet invasion in 1968. Czech
                    President Hus�k had made his first-ever visit to a foreign country, to Germany,
                    they had begun to negotiate some foreign loans and there was increased
                    possibility of resumption of Czech-US negotiations over outstanding issues, like
                    the return of Czech gold held at Fort Know since World War II and US claims for
                    property seized by the Communists. Hopes also existed that cultural and
                    scientific exchanges might become possible, as they had with all other satellite
                    countries. There was also a feeling that staff morale in Prague was poor and
                    that management at this tough iron curtain post, where life was grey and
                    restricted by Czech secret police pressure, clearly needed a boost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that meant you had to learn Czech and spend
                        another nine months at FSI?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right, since my Serbo-Croatian was of no help. So we moved back to
                    Washington, rented a nice house in Bethesda and began the Czech language course
                    in late August 1978 - where I quickly discovered that Czech really is a very
                    hard language. Unlike other Slavic languages Czech was never properly codified,
                    I believe because the bible was not translated early on into a rationalized
                    version of Czech, as it had been into other eastern European languages. As a
                    result, the localized mediaeval peasant versions persisted and modern Czech
                    became a language in which the endings of nouns, adjectives, adverbs etc.
                    continue to be all over the place. From a student's point of view it's like
                    memorizing a pinball machine!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, I've tried.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0272" n="Page0272"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Nothing matches. It's simply ghastly memory work. Additional pressure
                    arose from the fact that the other six students in the class were, of course,
                    going to be on my staff when we got to Prague. So I had to put on a respectable
                    show, which took a lot of very hard work, while beginning the job of bonding and
                    shaping a team.</p>
                <p>As it turned out that was the easy part, since we all understood that Prague was
                    going to be a tough assignment, that the Czech intelligence service was going to
                    be aggressive and nasty, and that living conditions in this gloomy city under
                    the shadow of the Soviet '68 invasion would not be ideal. Within weeks we had
                    formed genuine human relationships and had become a team.</p>
                <p>Pat too wanted to play her part in Prague as DCM's wife and so decided to study
                    Czech as well, doing a part-time course at FSI. Since Christina was starting 2nd
                    grade at the French Lyc�e on Bradley Boulevard, which capitalized on her by now
                    excellent French and made her transition to the States easier, this meant twice
                    daily shuttling between Bethesda, Arlington and the Beltway, a very energy and
                    time consuming process which didn't help her frustrations with Czech's
                    impossible grammar. It was a stressful time for all of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, I take it you never got to Prague?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: In mid-February '79, six months into our course, I was called out of
                    class one day for a phone call. It was Personnel to say that they were terribly
                    sorry to have to tell me that my assignment had been broken and that I was not
                    going to Prague after all! Needless to say I was shocked, angry and very
                    disappointed, as were my class mates who had become my friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find out what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: More or less. As far as Ambassador Byrne is concerned, the prevalent
                    rumor, and I must stress it was only a rumor, was that he had been having an
                    affair with a woman agent of the Czech secret police - an incredibly dumb thing
                    to do, if true. What brought things to a head was that he reportedly gave her
                    some official papers of very low classification which were then used to
                    blackmail him; at which point he is finally said to have informed the Department
                    of the mess he was in.</p>
                <p>Whatever happened, the fact was that he was pulled out on very short, I heard
                    twenty-four hours, notice and that Frank Meehan, a recognized Eastern European
                    expert, who had been Chief of the Eastern Affairs Section in Berlin at the same
                    time I had my less than euphonious experience with Jim Carson, his Political
                    Section counterpart, was named to replace him. Meehan was clearly a very good
                    professional choice. My misfortune was -</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...That Meehan didn't need a DCM who would be as
                        experienced as you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I wouldn't put it quite that way. Ambassadors traditionally have an
                    absolute right to choose their DCMs and have, over their careers, collected
                    people they are like or are obliged to and who fit their comfort zone. These may
                    all have been factors in his decision to drop me. Whatever the reason, Meehan
                    picked someone else and I was out.</p>
                <p>2.Foreign Service Inspector</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that was the end of that. What happened next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: They had to park me somewhere, so I was asked to be a Foreign Service
                    Inspector, a temporary gig which turned out to be quite interesting.</p>
                <p>As you know, State Department Inspectors visit Embassies, Consulates, all parts
                    of the Department and individual Foreign Service officers assigned elsewhere, to
                    assess the quality of their posts' or offices' management and individual
                    officers' work and working conditions, and to uncover problems that might need
                    attention. During my two and a half months stint as an Inspector (April - June
                    1979), I was asked to inspect a number of the Foreign Service officers on
                    assignments to agencies in and around Washington. For example, I went out to the
                    Army War College near Gettysburg—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Up in Carlisle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, ...and visited a Foreign Service Officer who was teaching there. I
                    spent a day or two with him, met his superiors and then wrote an assessment of
                    how well he was doing, the kind of environment in which he worked, and made a
                    couple of recommendations as to how things might be improved. I also inspected a
                    few of our FSOs at the Environmental Protection Agency where some of them were
                    doing more or less important work.</p>
                <p>The most interesting period were the weeks I spent in USIA as part of a Team
                    inspecting a group of State Department Foreign Service Officers assigned there.
                    It was not a happy situation. Many of these people had no clear direction as to
                    what they were supposed to do. The lines of command were vague, the mission was
                    frequently unclear and many felt that they were not taken seriously because they
                    were not permanently in the USIA's career chain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the director of USIA at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0274" n="Page0274"/>
                <p>JAEGER: John Reinhardt, a Carter appointee, who had been Ambassador to Nigeria
                    and became USIA's first Afro-American Director. He was, incidentally, born in
                    Vermont and did a stint teaching at the University of Vermont after his
                    retirement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you meet him as an Inspector?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: No, but our Inspection Team did have an extensive meeting with his
                    Deputy, Charles Bray, a Senior Foreign Service Officer who had been Secretary
                    Rogers' press spokesman and who, to his great credit, had resigned over the
                    wiretapping of three FSO's when Kissinger came in. After his stint at USIA,
                    Reagan picked him as Ambassador to Senegal. He subsequently presided over a
                    budget-cutting exercise at State before retiring.</p>
                <p>Although Bray spoke to us in glowing terms about the wonderful work all the State
                    Department FSOs were doing in USIA, the more my colleagues and I got into it,
                    the more we found a very demoralized, unhappy and disoriented group of officers.
                    There was a clearly serious disconnect between the front office story and the
                    working level reality which suggested management neglect. At the end of our
                    inspection we drafted a rather critical report which put much of the
                    responsibility on Charles Bray. It promptly ran into stone walls, since Bray
                    clearly had friends in very high places, and its recommendations were never
                    implemented. On the contrary, Bray got his next Embassy and FSOs continued to be
                    assigned to USIA without needed reforms whenever Personnel somehow didn't know
                    what else to do with them.</p>
                <p>My stint as an Inspector was a fascinating learning experience, although clearly
                    not very satisfying professionally.</p>
                <p>3.Trying hard not to go to Quebec</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they dream up next for you to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, Personnel called one day and said that I had been chosen to be
                    Consul General in Quebec. Rene Levesque was going to have a referendum and they
                    wanted me to go up there to look after our interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In effect, to be the American pointman to Quebec?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0275" n="Page0275"/>
                <p>JAEGER: That was how, in a way, it actually worked out, although initially the
                    idea did not appeal to me at all. I tried to explain that I was a Europeanist,
                    that I really knew nothing about Canada and certainly didn't want to preside
                    over a lot of visas getting issued. In any case, what had just been done to me
                    entitled me to a better choice. All to no avail. They insisted and said that I
                    would have to go.</p>
                <p>Well, I was very upset, and literally went on strike, refused to go to the
                    Department and spent a month walking the towpath along the Potomac River to make
                    clear that I was seriously unhappy and close to quitting. When personnel would
                    phone up to ask that I come in to see them, my wife just said, “Well, he's
                    walking the towpath, and he's still very angry.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: After some weeks Bob Barry, my old friend from Zagreb who was one of the
                    Deputy Assistant Secretaries, called and said, “Look, George, you've made your
                    point and we are all aware of it. We're all sorry about what happened. But its
                    now time to get over it. Come in and see Dick Vine (the Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary for Europe then responsible for Canada). He wants to talk to you.” So,
                    I went in to see Dick Vine, who was very nice but said, “You know, the trouble
                    with you is that you're ignorant.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: “You don't know a damn thing about Quebec, and you haven't thought
                    through how important this job is to the US and how challenging it's going to

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: “Here is this huge country north of the United States thinking about
                    breaking up into bits and pieces, and you're going to be our man up there.
                    Unlike Czechoslovakia, which we all know a lot about and where nothing is going
                    to change in the immediate future, this is the place where you can actually play
                    a role!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here in Vermont we were acutely aware of the tension
                        between French and English Canada and the possibility of separation, and

                <p>JAEGER: Well, you're lucky it didn't. To cut a long story short, I told Dick that
                    I'd made my point and would do my best in Quebec in face of these challenges. I
                    then asked, “But what do I need to know?” Dick said, “Oh, you're bright. You go
                    up there, and you'll find out!” I said, “OK, but what are my instructions?” He
                    said, “You'll figure that out too. Go up there and see that things go
                    right.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you pretty much had carte blanche!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's how it turned out, since he then shifted the discussion to
                    ornithology and we spent the next half hour discussing the implications of bones
                    in wing structures, of flight patterns, and oddities of bird behavior! With that
                    I left and prepared to go to Quebec.</p>
                <p>Before arriving at post, I did, of course, call on the Ambassador in Ottawa, Ken
                    Curtis, a delightful former Governor of Maine with whom I developed a warm
                    relationship; and on our highly competent and consistently supportive DCM,
                    Richard Smith. Both offered helpful background and advice but also left things
                    essentially in my hands. I also met my very perceptive predecessor, Terry
                    McNamara - famous for his heroic rescue of many Vietnamese, in spite of orders
                    to the contrary. He drove them on a liberated ship down the Mekong to the open
                    sea, where they were all eventually picked up.</p>
                <p>4. Consul General in Quebec</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you actually take over in Quebec?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Pat, Christina and I arrived on a lovely fall day in September '79,
                    having, for the first time ever, driven(!) to a new post in our car. We were
                    welcomed by Eric Boswell, a tall, able young officer with good French, who was
                    to be my number two, and began to establish ourselves in our quarters on the
                    second floor of the spectacularly sited Consulate building next to the Chateau
                    Frontenac, whose large reception and dining rooms have dramatic, sweeping views
                    of the Chateau, the harbor and the St. Lawrence River. It was a setup ideal for
                    entertaining. The living quarters proved more modest, but were supplemented by a
                    nice garret apartment on the third floor, well-suited for guests. The only
                    obvious problem was the tiny, under-equipped kitchen, which became an ongoing
                    challenge.</p>
                <pb facs="0277" n="Page0277"/>
                <p>The surroundings too were fabulous: In front, the famous flag-bedecked 'Terasse'
                    along the wide St. Lawrence, thronging with people in clement weather while
                    during the long, cold winter months its famous toboggan run and skating rink
                    were centers of attraction. On the side of our building I found a tranquil
                    little park also facing the river, whose monument to Wolfe and Montcalm
                    commemorates the famous contestants of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. Once
                    a farm, this vast battlefield in time also became a lovely park extending far
                    beyond the battlements of Quebec's citadel, which dominate the town.</p>
                <p>We were also delighted with Christina's new school, the famous 'Ecole des
                    Ursulines', the first girls' school in North America, founded by Sr. Marie de
                    l'Incarnation in 1639. Although still run on rather old-fashioned Catholic
                    lines, the Ursulines were excellent and caring educators, and Christina was, by
                    and large, happy there. So far so good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what were your first impressions of the atmospherics in
                        Quebec?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Puzzling and complex. Even though 95% Francophone, Quebec, for all its
                    splendid hotels and restaurants, quaint streets, and historic sites, was
                    different from any comparably-sized provincial capital we knew in France. One
                    immediately sensed the ambivalence in a place where KFC fast-food outlets and
                    other clearly North American establishments competed with the Norman
                    architecture of the older houses and the reminders of Quebec's 'Anglo' past,
                    such as the white Episcopal Cathedral in the very center of town and the former
                    'Anglo' stronghold, the Chateau Frontenac, one of the great railway hotels built
                    in the 19th century to tie the new Canada together. Its this complexity which,
                    as I came to understand, reflects Quebec's tangled history - first French, then
                    taken over and governed by the English and finally, and not always happily,
                    Canadian.</p>
                <p>That these contradictions, and the grievances they had caused, had come to a head
                    and that passions were now running high, was also obvious. As I arrived, the
                    towns and villages were saturated with PQ (Parti Quebecois) posters demanding
                    Quebec's separation from Canada. PQ rallies, dominated by oceans of blue Quebec
                    flags bearing the fleur-de-lis, were of an intensity which was astonishing. The
                    PQ's pervasive theme song was the haunting melody of Gilles Vigneault's 'L'hiver
                    c'est mon pays', his moving, sentimental hymn which somehow summed up the French
                    nationalists' determination to achieve their mythic fatherland.</p>
                <p>Opposing the separatists in this visual and spiritual battle were red Canadian
                    flags which flew defiantly over Quebec city's citadel, the 'Terasse' and all
                    federal institutions throughout the province, as well as the many red maple-leaf
                    banners and posters on houses, barns and businesses, notably not only in the
                    English-speaking parts of the province, but throughout the French part as well,
                    reflecting the critical division on the issue among the French themselves.
                    Canada and Quebec were clearly approaching what most thought would be a
                    fundamental showdown in the 1980 referendum which would determine their
                    future.</p>

                <p>a. Love goes through the stomach!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given these first impressions, what, as you saw it, were
                        the main challenges you faced ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The first and most obvious was how, given our miniscule staff of four
                    Americans, eight or so locals and a tiny entertainment budget, I could reach out
                    to the conflicted leaders of this roiled society of four million Francophones
                    and two million Anglophones and allophones, who had a provincial government
                    larger than many medium-sized countries.</p>
                <p>To give you a sense of scale, Quebec's “foreign office” alone, the Ministry of
                    Intergovernmental Affairs, had at least five hundred officials! More
                    importantly, there were dozens of major players on Quebec's political stage with
                    whom I needed to establish working and personal relationships, ranging from
                    Premier Rene Levesque, his entourage and key Ministers and Claude Ryan, the
                    Liberal opposition leader and his party, to Quebec's Mayor, Jean Pelletier, key
                    journalists, academics and business people, as well as influential, remnants of
                    old 'Anglo' society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All with a tiny staff and a shoe-string budget? That was
                        quite a challenge!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, it was Pat who came up with the brilliant idea. She reasoned that
                    if the Quebecois were anything like the French, their affections would run
                    through their stomachs, since, as we had learned in Paris, French people worship
                    good food. So the answer was to get a first rate chef! To help, Pat offered to
                    give up an as yet unfilled domestic position and make do with a part-time
                    cleaning lady!</p>
                <p>No sooner said than done, I called up the housekeeper in the Ambassador's
                    residence in Paris whom I had come to know and asked if one of the three
                    first-rate young sous-chefs in the Ambassador's world-class kitchen might be
                    interested in a year's adventure in Quebec. We could offer free transportation
                    (at our expense), free living quarters and an admittedly small salary.</p>
                <p>Lo and behold, three weeks later, John-Claude arrived, a superlative young chef
                    trained in two and three star Paris restaurants. Within another week or so we
                    were able to give our first major reception at which Jean-Claude's offerings
                    simply knocked people's socks off. From then on, as we gave dinners, lunches and
                    many more receptions, our residence became one of the very few places in Quebec
                    where its deeply divided politicians and others, from all sides of the argument,
                    genuinely liked to come and, as importantly, could talk to each other on neutral
                    ground. We had, in short, turned the American Consulate General into a political
                    salon at the center of the storm!</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0279" n="Page0279"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you're illustrating the crucial importance of good
                        diplomatic entertaining which the American public thinks is such a waste of
                        taxpayer dollars! Your point also reinforces the contrast you described
                        earlier of French reactions to the contrasting styles of those two American
                        Ambassadors in Paris (Rush and Hartman). What, by the way happened after
                        Jean-Claude's year was up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: He was succeeded first by Dominique, who subsequently became the Aga
                    Khan's chef in Chantilly, and finally by Frederique, who liked Quebec, or at
                    least its girls, so much that he decided to stay there. They all did well, but
                    were very different personalities. When we were not entertaining, they ate with
                    us as part of the family, something unheard of in France at the time. On some of
                    those long winter evenings when the St. Lawrence was frozen solid I even taught
                    John-Claude how to play chess in front of the fire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Years later we visited Dominique in his country house in France, and have
                    remained good friends.</p>
                <p>b. Coming to understand why everyone was so upset.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some the other challenges as you were getting
                        started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The second, and even more important, was to try to understand what I was
                    dealing with. When I arrived I only had the vaguest grasp of the historic
                    background of Quebec's crisis and of the events which had produced this Parti
                    Quebecois which so passionately wanted to break up Canada. Nor was it clear to
                    me what the implications would be if Levesque did win his referendum, whether
                    and how the outcome would affect American interests, hence to what extent I
                    should lean in one direction or the other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But wasn't there a clear American policy on Quebec
                        separatism?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0280" n="Page0280"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes and no. The standard policy sentence, then and now, was that “the
                    United States prefers a united Canada, but that it is up to the Canadians,
                    themselves, to decide.” It dates back to a Department paper of the late
                    seventies, the basis of a National Security Council document, neither of which,
                    as I said, I had ever seen. The difficulty with that sentence, particularly if
                    you were the fellow on the ground, was that it didn't tell you how strongly to
                    emphasize US preference for a united Canada, or, for that matter, Quebec's
                    democratic right to push the other way - precisely because it was designed to
                    straddle the issue. The distinction, as we will see, shortly became critical.
                    And as Dick Vine's 'briefing' had suggested, he apparently understood that and
                    wanted me to feel my way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see the problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>i. Meeting the Players in the PQ</p>
                <p>JAEGER: So I set off to call on all the key players in this feverish struggle,
                    who, besides becoming my principal contacts, helped me to understand Quebec.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose Rene Levesque was high one that list.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That was the first order of business- after I had made contact with
                    officials on his staff. Among them was the well-intentioned, but invariably
                    unctuous Protocol Chief Jacques Joli-Coeur and the people on the Quebec 'Foreign
                    Ministry's' large 'American desk', who, I quickly learned, had little
                    independent influence, peddled the party line and did not look very useful.</p>
                <p>A bit later, I met the heavyweights: Louis Bernard, Levesque's powerful, wise and
                    generous Chief of Staff, who again and again helped me greatly in maintaining
                    perspective; Richard Pouliot, a warm, highly educated Assistant Minister in
                    charge of managing their American operations, with whom I was to have many
                    productive talks; Robert Normand, the intensely competent and influential Deputy
                    Minister, whose military bearing and natty dress gave the misleading impression
                    of a corporate executive who had somehow strayed into the wrong camp, rather
                    than the key policy figure in Levesque's intra-Canadian, constitutional and
                    foreign strategizing he actually was; and, last but not least, Louise Beaudoin,
                    the boyish, seductive powerhouse, whom I called the 'Passionaria' in my
                    telegrams because of her deeply emotional commitment to the PQ's cause.</p>
                <pb facs="0281" n="Page0281"/>
                <p>She served as Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Claude Morin's Executive
                    Assistant, where she was often the fearless counter-weight to her cautious boss
                    and a major, often explosive personality in Parti Quebecois councils in her own
                    right. For added poignancy, the Quebec rumor mill had her romantically linked
                    with a whole series of PQ luminaries, including for a while Morin, and some
                    years later, when the PQ was in decline and she was working for Air Canada in
                    Paris, with the French Socialist Michel Rocard before he became Prime Minister.
                    Her retiring husband was rarely seen and was reportedly much more radical
                    she.</p>
                <p>This, by and large, was the core group in the PQ 'Bunker', as Levesque's and
                    Morin's rather jarring cement office block was called - symbolically situated
                    along the 'Grand Allee' across from Quebec's 'Assemblee Nationale' and below the
                    Citadel, the Canadian home of Quebec's all-French Royal 22nd Regiment, the
                    famous Francophone 'Vingt-Douze'.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then there was Claude Morin, himself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. A tweedy, pipe-smoking reflective man, completely accessible, but
                    not transparent. He had an MA from Columbia, had taught Social Services at Laval
                    and become a PQ member of the 'Assemblee Nationale' in 1976 when the PQ's
                    victory swept him and Levesque to power. He was, if not the, at least one of the
                    grand strategists of Quebec's constitutional tactics with respect to the rest of
                    Canada, would be the main drafter of the critically important wording of the
                    'Referendum Question', and was in charge of the global promotion of Quebec's
                    cause as its 'Foreign Minister'. It was therefore a special shock when it was
                    reported in the press some years later that Morin had, all along, been a paid
                    agent for the RCMP (the Canadian Mounted Police), in short Ottawa's man at the
                    heart of the PQ, a charge he vigorously refuted in a book called 'L'Affair
                    Morin'.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that made him a complex and mysterious figure. You
                        said he had a substantial staff of over 500?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Many of which were staffing Quebec Delegations all over the world. In the
                    PQ's heydays they tried to behave like Quebec embassies to the extent they were
                    allowed, propagating the Quebec cause and fighting at every turn for as
                    independent a role from Ottawa's as they could get.</p>
                <pb facs="0282" n="Page0282"/>
                <p>Needless to say that almost always set up an awkward dynamic with the local
                    Canadian Embassies, with which Quebec's Delegations were in constant
                    competition. This tug of war was worst in Paris, which quite overtly sympathized
                    with Levesque's cause, and where the Quebec Delegate General was often treated a
                    good deal better than the Canadian Ambassador. But the dynamic also applied at
                    Quebec's many other delegations in Latin America, Europe, Africa and elsewhere,
                    where Levesque's emissaries promoted their cause, encouraged separate political,
                    economic and cultural relations and tenaciously vied for recognition.</p>
                <p>ii. The first tussle: PQ reps in Washington?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were they represented in the US?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Their main operation was in New York, with Delegations in Boston, Chicago
                    and, I believe, Los Angeles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why New York and not Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well that goes to the heart of one my early tussles. I think Quebec's
                    representation was set up in New York in earlier times to promote commercial
                    relations.</p>
                <p>Since the PQ came to power, and we are now jumping a bit ahead of my story, its
                    overriding objective became political, to persuade America that an independent
                    Quebec would pose no threat to the United States. At my predecessor Terry
                    McNamara's urging, they had even dropped their earlier neutralist stance and had
                    committed themselves, somewhat reluctantly, to join NATO and NORAD once
                    independence was achieved - to reassure Washington in those late Cold War days
                    that an independent Quebec would be a good friend and ally, even though its
                    actual contributions would be very small.</p>
                <p>The PQ leadership was, of course, fully aware of Washington's nuanced policy on
                    Quebec independence which we just discussed. Even so, their ongoing nightmare
                    scenario was that Washington might panic and, at the end of the day tilt
                    actively against Quebec if it began to look like the PQ might actually win its
                    referendum. Given the finely balanced Quebec electorate, some of it very attuned
                    to the possible price it might have to pay for this adventure, active US
                    opposition could then make a PQ victory virtually impossible.</p>
                <pb facs="0283" n="Page0283"/>
                <p>Keeping Washington reassured and, as one PQ policy wonk put it, “as sound asleep
                    as possible”, therefore became critically important and led them to launch a
                    multi-pronged PR operation in the States; somewhat handicapped, they felt, by
                    the fact that they had no operational base in Washington. Getting US agreement
                    to opening a small Quebec office in DC therefore became a major Ministry
                    objective. The issue was raised with me insistently by Robert Normand and others
                    shortly after my arrival and confronted me with my first substantive
                    challenge.</p>
                <p>Looking into it, I concluded that the status quo was not as great an
                    inconvenience for them as it might seem, since the State Department had
                    interposed no objections to their officials in New York calling on people in
                    Washington, including State Department people who occasionally met with them
                    outside the building; but had repeatedly made clear that US diplomatic relations
                    were with Ottawa and not with any of the Canadian provinces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any clear instructions when you reported
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Strange as it may sound, no. On this and most other issues, the response,
                    when there was one, left me leeway: They would prefer things to remain as they
                    were, but implied they could live with a minimal Quebec presence in Washington
                    as well, as long as it did not claim to be a 'diplomatic' post.</p>
                <p>Well, the more I thought about it, the less this seemed to me a good idea. Making
                    this move some months before the referendum scheduled for May 1980, would be
                    seen from Ottawa's and the Canadian medias' perspective, as a worrying US
                    gesture favoring the PQ cause; would provide the Pequistes an improved
                    propaganda platform in the US capital; and, once the initial small office grew
                    larger, as it inevitably would, would set up the same genre of tensions with the
                    Canadian Embassy in Washington which was so deleteriously played out in Paris
                    and elsewhere. All this would unnecessarily complicate the situation, and could,
                    in any case be reconsidered if and when Levesque won his referendum and an
                    independent Quebec became an international reality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0284" n="Page0284"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, with our Embassy's support I simply maintained the line that we
                    could not agree - a big disappointment for Normand and the American desk at the
                    Ministry. Although I suspect the Department would not have made a big fuss had
                    Quebec simply opened a small Washington office without further ado, Morin's
                    Ministry grudgingly accepted the decision - partly, I suspect, because, in the
                    then hothouse atmosphere, they had a wildly exaggerated notion of the interest
                    in Quebec issues in Washington, and so assumed, as I learned in due course, that
                    my instructions came from 'the highest levels'. While I did nothing to foster
                    this illusion, my real problem was, quite the contrary, maintaining sufficient
                    interest in Quebec developments in Washington. As we will shortly see, the
                    Quebec issue would not be on the administration's front burner till a month or
                    so before the referendum.</p>
                <p>Normand, later the editor of Quebec City's most important newspaper 'Le Soleil',
                    still spoke of this decision somewhat bitterly many years later, when, as
                    Diplomat-in-Residence at Middlebury College, I took a group of students on a
                    study trip to Quebec City. As far as I know Quebec still does not have a
                    Delegation in Washington and, now that the prospect of independence has receded,
                    may in fact find it more useful to have its main office in New York.</p>
                <p>iii. Parizeau, Trudeau and Levesque.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that incident crimp your relations with Levesque? How
                        did you get along with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I was granted my first meeting with him shortly after my arrival and
                    liked him immediately. Unlike the rest of his crew who were largely earnest
                    types, Levesque was self-deprecating, wry and often very funny - a bit of a
                    Charlie Chaplin type in his invariably unpressed suits or his incongruous safari
                    outfit. I always had the feeling that he was both the principal actor and amused
                    observer of the PQ drama, whose risks and limitations he understood as well as
                    anyone.</p>
                <p>One of the first things he told me was how much he liked Americans, a
                    predilection he acquired as a 'Stars ands Stripes' correspondent during World
                    War II, when he was first stationed in London and then followed Allied troops
                    across Europe. He clearly felt comfortable in the US and with Americans, in
                    contrast to English Canada, which he saw as unwelcoming to francophones and
                    uptight.</p>
                <p>Levesque's post-war career did not really take off until the late 'fifties when
                    he became beloved and famous for his CBC French service television show, in
                    which he explained politics, the world and all sorts of more mundane subjects to
                    his francophone Quebec audience, making cracks and scrawling on his blackboard.
                    His program was a critical factor in the French Quebeckers' awakening, greatly
                    broadening their horizons.</p>
                <pb facs="0285" n="Page0285"/>
                <p>As a result, when the Quiet Revolution hit Quebec in 1960 and marked the end of
                    Conservative Premier Maurice Duplessis' long, reactionary rule, Levesque's great
                    popularity and quixotic magnetism helped make him a major political figure;
                    powerful enough, in time, to draw most of the separatist, marxist, reformist,
                    nihilist and violent revolutionary factions which had sprung up, into the
                    overall moderating framework of his new separatist Parti Quebecois.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that didn't happen till the late sixties, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. The Quiet Revolution only led to the 1960 victory of Jean
                    Lesage's Liberals, which promised ingoing reform, and Levesque's first election
                    to Quebec's parliament, the Assemblee Nationale. He was made Public Works and
                    then Natural Resources Minister, nationalized Quebec's existing hydro-electric
                    resources and so became the father of its vast new hydro-electric facility on
                    James Bay, Hydro-Quebec. Levesque understood from the outset that only modern
                    industrial development could draw Quebec's largely rural and still very
                    parochial French population into the 20th century and that the key was the
                    availability of ample power. It is this fundamental contribution, more than his
                    ultimately unsuccessful role as a separatist leader, which has made him the
                    father of modern Quebec.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did Levesque then become leader of the PQ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The crisis came when the Liberal Party convention in October 1967 refused
                    to consider Quebec independence. Levesque walked out, formed his own
                    'Sovereignty-Association' Party, and later merged with other independentist
                    factions to form the Parti Quebecois in 1968.</p>
                <p>Even then, however, time was not yet on his side. Quebec remained nervous about
                    taking the leap toward independence, fear which was accentuated by the Montreal
                    crisis in October 1970, when the small but violent FLQ, the Quebec Liberation
                    Front, kidnapped a British diplomat in Montreal and seized and executed a Quebec
                    Labor Minister, leading the Quebec Government to ask Prime Minister Trudeau in
                    Ottawa to invoke the War Powers Act and to bring in the Army to assure security
                    and order. Fear of extremism, socialism and dangerous radicalism, which most
                    anglophones and many francophones associated with the PQ independentists,
                    lingered, and the Liberals, led by Robert Bourassa, remained in power. It was
                    only in 1976 that, to Levesque's own intense surprise, the PQ was swept into
                    power and Rene Levesque became Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that helps set the stage. How did your relations
                        with Levesque evolve?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0286" n="Page0286"/>
                <p>JAEGER: I think he liked me from the beginning and was surprisingly frank during
                    our meetings in his office, over the occasional dinners at our place which he
                    clearly enjoyed, and during many casual encounters at other functions. I think
                    he understood that his subordinates and colleagues would often provide me with
                    filtered or overly emotional information, and clearly wanted Washington to have
                    balanced accounts of his actual views and intentions - which were generally more
                    perceptive and moderate than the party line.</p>
                <p>The result was a long series of detailed telegrams in which I was able to report
                    his concerns and assessments: About his intention to nationalize Asbestos
                    Corporation, which had a particularly bad reputation in Quebec, about the
                    struggles over the referendum question, the PQ's electoral successes and
                    failures, relations with Ottawa and even some intra-party fights: Accounts which
                    became specially critical before the Referendum and during the constitutional
                    discussions in 1981. When, as we will see a bit later, many of these telegrams
                    were prematurely declassified by the Department at the request of a Canadian
                    journalist, there were shocked reactions from high-level Pequistes as to how
                    much 'secret' information Levesque had revealed to the Americans!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Asbestos. Wasn't that one of Jacques
                        Parizeau's great projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. Parizeau was Levesque's formidable Finance Minister,
                    arguably the second most important man and by far the most brilliant and
                    incongruous of Levesque's cabinet.</p>
                <p>A round and florid man in three piece suits with gold chains, he loved good food
                    and serious wines, and looked and acted every bit the Victorian English lord,
                    rather than the passionate separatist and defender of the (French) people he
                    was. It was Parizeau who created the 'Caisse de Depot', the Quebec Savings bank,
                    and the 'Societe Generale du Quebec' to foster investment in key Quebec
                    industries, both of which came to play major economic roles in and beyond
                    Quebec, and who played a key role in bringing Quebec's unions onside. He could
                    have been a finance minister in a country of any size and done extremely well.
                    At the same time he was a much harder-line independentist than Levesque, and
                    eventually broke with him over this issue in 1984.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever find out how he came to this position to the
                        left of Levesque? It seems almost out of character.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0287" n="Page0287"/>
                <p>JAEGER: I saw him frequently in his office and over lunches at the Chateau
                    Frontenac, during which he talked among other things about his political
                    evolution. He was the son of a very comfortable Montreal family, was educated at
                    St. Stanislas, an old-fashioned but excellent Jesuit school in Montreal, studied
                    in Paris and got his PhD at the London School of Economics. He was at the time a
                    conventional Canadian federalist, destined for a prosperous career, until, one
                    day - he said it happened on a train to Ottawa - he was struck by the profound
                    injustice and incongruity of Quebec's position and resolved then and there to
                    become an independentist.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, he sometimes reminisced, almost all the people who later became
                    prime movers in the Quebec drama, Levesque, Trudeau and Parizeau himself, had
                    gone to the same Jesuit school, were close friends, sometimes shared the same
                    digs and even girlfriends and talked endlessly about the issues thrown up by the
                    Quiet Revolution. Yet, at the end of the day, they went in quite different
                    directions. As he told the story, one night, after a good drinking party and a
                    final emotional discussion, they simply split. Trudeau went off to become a
                    Canadian nationalist, arguing that you can't just break up Canada. Parizeau
                    remained firmly on the separatist side, while Levesque, somewhat less radical,
                    argued that independence could be a process achieved in stages. So the drama
                    which shook Canada throughout the sixties, seventies and eighties, had a very
                    personal side which may have made the fight more poignant and even sharper.</p>
                <p>Parizeau also stood apart from his PQ colleagues. A man with a large head, a
                    powerful, highly educated brain, a witty tongue, an Oxford accent with just a
                    little French tinge, a passion for women, and charmingly old fashioned courtesy
                    and grace, he was both intensely professorial and a snob. When I asked him one
                    day what he thought of a fellow Minister, Bernard Landry, he said, “You know,
                    just because one shares the same politics, doesn't mean one has to lunch with
                    people!” Even so, as long as he was on Levesque's team he was always loyal, even
                    when he disagreed and would have preferred a harder line.</p>
                <p>In the end, it was his unyielding separatism and sharp tongue which brought about
                    his downfall when, many years later, it was his turn to be Prime Minister. As
                    the press reported it, he told a group of diplomats during the 1995 referendum
                    that despite the guarantee of an offer of partnership with the rest of Canada
                    before declaring sovereignty following a “Yes” vote, what mattered most was to
                    get a majority vote from Quebec citizens for secession from Canada, because with
                    that, Quebecers would be trapped like “lobsters thrown into boiling water”. Even
                    worse, when the PQ lost that referendum by only a few thousands of votes,
                    Parizeau blamed the defeat in his concession speech on “money and the ethnic
                    vote”. It was typical Parizeau, but he did not recover.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember hearing of that uproar. Did you have any major
                        issues which involved him directly?</hi>

                <pb facs="0288" n="Page0288"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Apart from the 1980 referendum and its aftermath, the only major issue,
                    toward the end of my tour, involved the sharp dispute with Canada and with
                    Quebec over what we considered unfair subsidies of soft-wood lumber. My
                    instructions were to put pressure on the Quebec government to stop this.
                    Parizeau's amused response was, “What subsidies?” and challenged me to document
                    our claim. He had made sure that they were so well hidden that they would be
                    very difficult to prove! Since I left shortly afterwards, I don't know how this
                    was resolved.</p>
                <p>iv. Claude Ryan, Pettigrew and the Quebec Liberals</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's turn to the Quebec federalists, the provincial
                        Liberal party who opposed the PQ and wanted Canada to remain united. They
                        were obviously a formidable force, since they succeeded in blocking the PQ.
                        Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: There were in the first place all the anglophones and other non-French
                    Quebeckers in and around Montreal and the Eastern townships, a bloc of give or
                    take 2 Million people who for language and cultural reasons did not want Quebec
                    to become a separate Francophone entity in which they would a permanent
                    minority. So to offset this and win a majority in the 1980 and all subsequent
                    referenda, the PQ had to get the support of a very substantial majority of the 4
                    Million francophones in the province. And, counter-intuitively, this wasn't as
                    easy as it may sound.</p>
                <p>For French Quebec is far from homogeneous. Much of the francophone business
                    community and its middle class and wealthier members were and, I am sure remain,
                    conscious of the economic importance of Quebec's links with the rest of Canada
                    and concerned about the uncertainty which a separation process would inevitably
                    entail, including its effect on the US.</p>
                <p>Beyond that many worried that an independent Quebec would not, in the end, be
                    able to hack it if they cut themselves off from the rest of Canada. Where, for
                    instance would all the social subsidies come from, or the money for all the
                    other trappings of an independent state? There were still others who were simply
                    francophone Canadian patriots, i.e. people who had served in the Canadian army;
                    and those who, while concerned about Quebec's grievances, thought they could be
                    redressed by continuing negotiation within Canada.</p>
                <p>So whatever they may think of Quebec's ties and problems with English Canada, for
                    many of the Francophones the language issue was not the only or even the primary
                    concern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Politically these people rallied around Quebec's Liberal
                        party?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0289" n="Page0289"/>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. And together they constituted a formidable conservative
                    force, which advocated resolution of problems through ongoing negotiation within
                    the Canadian framework.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about the Liberal party's leadership. I
                        assume you worked closely with them as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The head of the party and Levesque's protagonist was Claude Ryan, a
                    craggy man who looked like he could have been a brother of Abraham Lincoln -
                    who, by the way, was his great role model and hero. Ryan had been the highly
                    respected editor of the prestigious French language paper 'Le Devoir', had
                    incurred Trudeau's enmity over the federal government's intervention during the
                    October crisis in 1970, but, like many other francophone Quebeckers, was not at
                    all satisfied with the state of Quebec's relations with Ottawa. His fierce
                    quarrel with the PQ was primarily over his conviction that these issues could be
                    dealt with by means short of separation, which he thought would be disastrous
                    for both Quebec and Canada. He was indefatigable in his opposition and
                    particularly in the winter before the referendum crisscrossed the province in
                    ice and snow, with his galoshes and trademark umbrella, urging francophones not
                    to jump ship.</p>
                <p>Curiously, for all his passion and commitment, Ryan was not a great speaker and
                    was even difficult to talk to since he tended to mumble rapidly and was
                    superficially aloof. What shone through was his deep commitment and the
                    intellectual power of his arguments, always meticulously developed and
                    researched. Although he was usually overscheduled, since, unlike the PQ, he did
                    not dispose of a large staff to back him up, Ryan was always kind to me and took
                    time to receive me graciously from time to time.</p>
                <p>When I asked him one day if there was anything I could do for him, he allowed
                    that the thing that would give him the greatest pleasure was a set of Lincoln's
                    writings which had just been published! I was able to present this three volume
                    set to him on behalf of the US government a few weeks later and am sure he
                    worked through it in detail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A rather strange personality for a successful politician.
                        Ryan is also an odd name for a francophone. But I remember there were others
                        like Daniel Johnson...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: ..the Liberal leader in the 60's before Lesage. This happened often,
                    usually as a result of Scottish or Irish immigrant families who intermarried and
                    became francophone.</p>
                <p>I should add a word about Ryan's famous young assistant, Pierre Pettigrew, who
                    was constantly at his side, wrote many of his speeches, advised on tactics, in
                    short was Ryan's indispensable amanuensis.</p>
                <pb facs="0290" n="Page0290"/>
                <p>I still vividly remember seeing Pierre for the first time languidly reclining in
                    the members gallery in the 'Assemblee Nationale', a tall, Byronic, strikingly
                    handsome young man, who stood in stark contrast to his somber surroundings in
                    his brilliantly white suit, vest and gold chain, while Ryan was giving a major
                    speech on the floor. I came to know him well and found him not only
                    intellectually interesting - he had studied at Oxford and in his late twenties
                    been Political Director of the NATO Assembly, an alliance think tank - but a
                    valuable source for understanding the Quebec Liberals' assessments of the
                    rapidly evolving situation, a cause to which he was passionately devoted.
                    Although just starting his political career, Pierre was already intensely
                    ambitious and, inter alia, introduced us to the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec,
                    the Crown's representative, whose daughter he was dating - an affair which ended
                    unhappily.</p>
                <p>Clearly a rising star, Pierre joined Trudeau's staff after the referendum, became
                    a Vice president of Deloitte &amp; Touche, and eventually fulfilled his real
                    ambition by becoming a Minister in Chretien's cabinet and then Foreign Minister
                    under Paul Martin. Whether he was a sufficient heavy-weight to cope with the
                    world of George W. Bush and Condoleezza Rice has been widely questioned.
                    Following some incidents of a personal nature, he ultimately lost both his job
                    and his seat in parliament in 2006.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I remember reading about that. In this line-up of
                        players, was the Church still a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>v. Cardinal Roy</p>
                <p>JAEGER: Only indirectly because of the respect enjoyed by then Cardinal Maurice
                    Roy, who had become beloved for his dedication and valor as a military chaplain
                    in World War II. Roy had lived with the troops instead of in some comfortable
                    billet in the rear and had often risked his life in the thick of combat to give
                    last rites to dying soldiers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see him from time to time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: He was among the first I called on. He always received me in a plain
                    black cassock and talked very frankly about the dramatic turn Quebec had taken
                    away from the Church. His message to his priests, serving half-empty churches,
                    was above all to be modest and repentant of the Church's past excesses and to
                    focus on being good shepherds. Even so, the Church in Quebec had been so
                    discredited that he was never a major player in the independence fight. Even so,
                    people like Parizeau and Levesque, who certainly didn't go to church, treated
                    the Cardinal with courtesy and serious respect.</p>
                <pb facs="0291" n="Page0291"/>
                <p>I am tempted to record two short exchanges which characterize the man. At one of
                    our receptions I asked him whether his frequent trips to Rome, where he was on a
                    Committee of Cardinals which supervised a revision of Canon Law, were
                    interesting and productive. He looked rather dubious and said, you know, the
                    discussions are always about the same thing, sex, sex and more sex! On another
                    occasion, Pat and I were seeing him to the door. He stopped, looked at us and
                    said: “You two are a nice couple. Keep it that way!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way he was reflecting the Vatican of John the
                        Twenty-Third.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right, although after the Quiet Revolution the Quebec church faced
                    very special problems which it has still not overcome.</p>
                <p>vi. What brought about the crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe this is the right point to step back and discuss how
                        you came to understand Quebec and the crisis which led the independentists
                        to want to break up Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Quite obviously the answer flowed from Quebec's unusual history, a point
                    driven home to me by all sides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just look at the license plates - “Je me souviens”!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. The starting point to understanding Quebec nationalist
                    feelings was that the French were there first: Not only because Jacques Cartier
                    discovered the place, but because early French settlers under Samuel de
                    Champlain, who arrived in 1608, and their little band of successors, mostly from
                    Normandy and Brittany, built up this French outpost in the New World against
                    tremendous odds.</p>
                <p>We don't have the time to go over the next century and half in detail, except to
                    stress that it was a very hard struggle. It took a man a year to clear and plant
                    an acre of land in rocky virgin terrain where winters were cold and long. For
                    hundreds of years Quebec remained a place whose French rural population remained
                    physically isolated, poor and dominated by an ultramontane Catholic church -
                    which had not gone through any of the European reform movements and had missed
                    the French revolution...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ..and on account of that, lost much of its potential for
                        modernizing cultural contact with France—</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0292" n="Page0292"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Precisely. It was the church which, through these centuries, constituted
                    not only French Quebec's moral and religious authority, but provided virtually
                    all the social services in its many little villages and towns, which were almost
                    inaccessible in the winter and hard to reach at any time, where people often
                    lived under conditions of great hardship and where new ideas and modernizing
                    influences rarely seeped through. It was the local priest, and some nuns
                    perhaps, as well as the local monasteries, on whom people depended for advice,
                    judicial services, old age help, medical assistance and what-have-you and who at
                    the same time told them how to live.</p>
                <p>Moreover, because of the peculiar arrangements Louis XIV imposed at Quebec's
                    founding, which gave the church vast land grants and its bishops a co-role in
                    governing, the province's two cardinals, one in Quebec City and one in Montreal,
                    remained highly conservative potentates to whom Quebec's prime ministers and
                    other senior people usually deferred - until their hold on people suddenly
                    collapsed in the Quiet Revolution of 1960. The extent of this stifling
                    ecclesiastical power is still reflected in the silver-steepled churches, and in
                    the vast, now empty, monasteries and seminaries which dot Quebec's landscape to
                    this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Essentially the medieval role of the church.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. So when you visualize an eighteenth and nineteenth century,
                    even an early twentieth century French village up on the St. Lawrence or in the
                    hinterland, it was a very closed community, with few comforts, lots of
                    backbreaking work, considerable drinking, frequent death, childbirth often still
                    on the kitchen table, particularly in the winter, and, at the center of it all,
                    the village priest, who kept them all deferential and on the straight and
                    narrow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But then the British defeated France on the Plains of
                        Abraham, I think it was 1759.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: And that's when the English fact was added to the equation. New France
                    became an English Province. And, after the Loyalists came pouring north after
                    the American Revolution, English power came to prevail not only in Quebec but in
                    the areas west of it, todays Ontario and beyond, leading to the division of the
                    country under the Constitutional Act of 1791 into Upper and Lower Canada.</p>
                <p>British dominance brought large investment, control of the fur trade and much
                    land, and, inevitably set in motion the bitter conflict between the poorer and
                    often less well educated French and their new English rulers. This played out in
                    the first part of the 19th century in the battles between British Governors and
                    the French dominated legislature, until Lord Durham in his famous or infamous
                    report, depending which side one was one, advised Whitehall in 1839 that the
                    gradual amalgamation of the 'inferior' and backward French into a larger English
                    whole, a united Province of Canada, was the only viable long-term solution.</p>

                <p>JAEGER: That's right. In Quebec the English dominated the economic scene,
                    especially in Montreal and to a somewhat lesser extent in Quebec City, the key
                    cities in which the French population became the more or less docile working
                    class and the attendant inferior social and economic status. Huge fur trading
                    and related operations were launched through the new Hudson Bay company and
                    almost every part of Quebec's economic life brought under English control. The
                    church accommodated itself by preaching “let the English get rich, we'll go to
                    heaven.” Indeed I have read accounts that Cardinals of Montreal actually made
                    deals with the powers that be in which they promised to keep the French Catholic
                    workers pliant in return for commitments of no interference with the Church's
                    interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And all this assured that English was the dominant
                        language, even in Quebec.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The English language was certainly the dominant language in business
                    dealings and also became a means of control. For example I learned that
                    insurance contracts and all sorts of other business documents were usually
                    produced only in English, so that francophones had to get someone to translate
                    or sign without understanding what they were agreeing.</p>
                <p>This kind of insult led to a pervasive feeling that, while the French were the
                    majority in Quebec province, they were, by definition, second class citizens in
                    their own home, under what, in effect, was a de facto colonial regime. This put
                    the French in many of these relationships in a position rather analogous to that
                    of American blacks before ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...the Civil Rights movement in..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: ... in this country. Unequal relationships were also replicated in the
                    social realm, where there was no doubt who the top dogs were. The Garrison Club
                    in Quebec City, and many similar exclusive institutions in Montreal were clearly
                    English in atmosphere and membership, with a handful of upper-class French token
                    members to disprove the rule.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still, Quebec was allowed to retain its parliament and
                        Catholic religion, and the French language clearly was not eradicated as
                        Lord Durham recommended.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0294" n="Page0294"/>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. It was all a grand compromise, which broke down only from
                    time to time, i.e. in the World War I and II conscription crises, but otherwise
                    simmered just below the surface.</p>
                <p>Throughout most of this time the English-speaking upper classes dominated but
                    wisely allowed some French Quebeckers to occupy fairly important positions and
                    to make good careers, like Pierre Trudeau's father, who was rather well to do.
                    The disparity was nevertheless underscored in Montreal, to cite the most
                    important example, by the fact that the English upper crust lived in their
                    richer, more fashionable world in Westmount, while the better-off French, who
                    were seen by some as Uncle Toms, lived in Outrement below.</p>
                <p>As for the large underprivileged, less educated French working class, life was
                    less pleasant. They struggled under sometimes appalling living and working
                    conditions as English-dominated industries sprang up. While long-suffering, they
                    often felt humiliated and were sustained mostly by their close community ties,
                    their shared sense of French identity and the spiritual support and control of
                    dominant Mother Church.</p>
                <p>It was from this background of real and sometimes imagined grievances that
                    Quebec's license plate theme “Je me souviens” (I remember) derives its
                    poignancy.</p>
                <p>vii. The Quiet Revolution</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did all this finally come to a head?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Things went on pretty much like this until after World War II. Then all
                    kinds of things began happening simultaneously. Although the French Quebeckers
                    had resisted military service in anglophone units, they nevertheless fought
                    valiantly once overseas and came back to their towns and villages with a
                    different, expanded world view. Radio, followed by telephones and television
                    made a huge impact. Roads began to be built and paved throughout the province,
                    making cars and busses more ubiquitous. The effect was the creation of new
                    levels of connectedness never seen before. And, with them came new ideas and a
                    gradual awareness that the rigid, profoundly conservative, backward world of
                    French Quebec could in the fact be changed. It all came together in a sort of
                    snowballing effect which reached its peak in 1960 in, what has come to be called
                    the “Quiet Revolution.”</p>
                <pb facs="0295" n="Page0295"/>
                <p>Whatever it was, it was spontaneous, simultaneous, and immensely powerful. In the
                    beginning of the year, the churches were full. By the end they were empty and
                    the power of the hierarchy was broken. With this came the end of conservative
                    Uncle Tom governments, like the autocratic and corrupt Duplessis regime, and of
                    the old order in Quebec society, replaced, almost overnight, by a bubbling
                    cocktail of surging new forces. There was a sudden flowering in the francophone
                    arts, in music, literature, theater and movies, all of which rejected
                    traditional conventions and reached in new directions to express the excitement
                    of this new Quebec. There was an equally sudden flowering of more or less
                    radical new political groupings, which ranged from extreme Marxists, nihilists
                    and anarchists, to an array of Quebec nationalist factions, all pulling in
                    different directions but united in a general sense that the old order had to go,
                    that English dominance had to go, and that Quebec needed to find a new
                    identity.</p>
                <p>It was a critical turning point and an intensely exciting period, albeit a
                    potentially dangerous mix, since it was directionless and there were all kinds
                    of competing personalities who wanted to lead Quebec in quite different
                    directions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Until Levesque sort of pulled it all together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, as he himself recounts in his Memoirs, it was not a straight line
                    process. Duplessis, as we have said, was in the first instance replaced by the
                    Liberal Lesage government, which started major reforms: It secularized
                    education, passed new labor legislation which made forming unions easier,
                    encouraged investment, nationalized key resource sectors, such as the Province's
                    power companies, and under Levesque's guidance as Minister for Resources,
                    launched Hydro-Quebec, whose power resources were to transform Quebec's
                    economy.</p>
                <p>Had Lesage's Liberals been willing to consider separatism Levesque might have
                    remained a Liberal. As it was he quit their convention in 1967 and, in a major
                    act of political courage, founded the Sovereignty Association Movement, which
                    later merged with other independentist groups into Levesque's new Parti
                    Quebecois, which from the outset was committed to achieving Quebec
                    independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the idea was certainly in the air.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It certainly was. At the extremes, the FLQ terrorists had been bomb
                    throwing all through the 60's, culminating in the crisis of 1970. Rejection of
                    English Canada's dominance had been and was the dominant theme of the Quiet
                    Revolution. And de Gaulle had just made his historic call of “Vive le Quebec
                    Libre” in Montreal.</p>
                <pb facs="0296" n="Page0296"/>
                <p>Even so, as we discussed earlier, the PQ did not actually come to power until it
                    swept the Province in 1976 and Levesque became Prime Minister. The rest was
                    history.</p>
                <p>viii: Pulling it all together</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there you were, only months before the Referendum which
                        could potentially break up Canada. You had seen all these key people and, I
                        would think, had read a lot. What conclusions did you reach after coming to
                        understand the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The more I delved into Quebec history, the more sympathetic I became to
                    the francophones' complaints, hyped as they were for political effect. But the
                    issue was not whether French Quebec had just grievances - even the Quebec
                    Liberals called for major reforms, internally and in Quebec's relations with the
                    rest of Canada. The core issue was whether Canada should therefore be broken
                    up.</p>
                <p>And there the answer was simpler. When I looked at the map of Canada and
                    visualized this vast country broken into two, and eventually even more parts -
                    since both the Maritimes and some of the Western Provinces would probably also
                    want to splinter off in time - it became clear that, with the Cold War still
                    raging, a disintegrating northern neighbor could not be in the US interest.</p>
                <p>I thought of the additional Soviet and Iron Curtain Embassies this would create
                    to our north, of Canada's diminished strength and stature as an ally, and of the
                    new alignments an independent Quebec might enter into as a potential French
                    surrogate in North America. Our policy formula therefore struck the right tone:
                    We don't interfere, its up to the Canadians to decide, although we don't conceal
                    the fact that we prefer Canada to remain united. The rest was a matter of
                    emphasis.</p>
                <p>This was soon to be resolved in a down-to-earth way. From the moment of my
                    arrival, the Chief of Protocol and others had inundated me with invitations to
                    government or PQ functions and gatherings of various kinds. I usually found
                    myself near the center of the table next to a Minister, sometimes beside
                    Levesque, and soon came to realize that I was put there to be photographed for
                    the press or seen in television clips. The idea was to create the impression on
                    TV, radio and the provincial press, that here was the Consul General of the
                    United States, sitting happily next to the PQ potentates, being chummy with them
                    and having a good dinner...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...all to convey the impression that the US was backing
                        them, which in effect we were not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0297" n="Page0297"/>
                <p>JAEGER: That's it. Once I realized that I was being used as a media prop I made
                    my counter move. I told the Chief of Protocol that I would be delighted to
                    participate in whatever functions they wanted to invite me to, but on condition
                    that I too would be asked to say a few words. Since my brief remarks invariably
                    ended with a low key repetition of our position, with its famous sentence, that
                    its up to Canadians to decide, but that we prefer Canada to remain united...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Reminding them of the basic American policy...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: ...my official invitations dropped off considerably!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Even so, my occasional toasts and brief statements on public occasions
                    helped make our position clear across Quebec. In the end this probably cost the
                    PQ some points in the Referendum, since there was a significant number of
                    francophones, particularly middle class and business people, who wanted some
                    kind of separation from Canada but only if it would not cause trouble with the
                    US.</p>
                <p>ix. The French and other Consulates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the French. What was their role in
                        Quebec?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The French had built a major presence in Quebec, which assumed additional
                    importance since de Gaulle's 'Vive le Qu�bec libre!' - a statement which, in
                    retrospect, turns out to have been intended more as a poke in the eye for
                    Washington, rather than a French commitment to Quebec independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember the Canadian response—Vive le Bretagne
                        Libre! (Live free Brittany)? Laughter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. Neither one is 'libre' at this point, so it goes to show.</p>
                <p>Be that as it may, de Gaulle did build up the French Consulate General in Quebec
                    City into a quasi-Embassy with a staff of around fifty, over ten times larger
                    than ours. They had all kinds of exchange and media programs and were into
                    everything. There were even rumors of French money was flowing under the table
                    to PQ political operations, media and what have you. The whole thing was not
                    entirely transparent.</p>
                <pb facs="0298" n="Page0298"/>
                <p>My courtesy call on the French Consul General shortly after my arrival was not a
                    success. He kept me cooling my heels for 20 or 25 minutes, presumably to
                    establish the terms of our relationship. When, at that point, I informed a
                    staffer that I would come back another time, my distinguished colleague emerged
                    from his office and welcomed me in French with a rather condescending “Dear
                    colleague, how are you, I am certain we will get along well together.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: We didn't hit it off. He was stiff, hyper-protective of his perceived
                    role, and clearly suspicious of Americans. Mercifully he was soon replaced by
                    Henri Rethore, a much more sensitive, intelligent and open man, with whom I
                    formed a genuine personal friendship and had long interesting and very realistic
                    conversations about Quebec developments, even though French policy hewed much
                    closer to the PQ. Long retired, Henry is still a friend.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The Brits closed their small Consulate just after my arrival and
                    consolidated in Montreal. The only other diplomat was a lone, largely invisible
                    Haitian Consul General, who appeared only occasionally at official
                    functions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I assume there were many more in Montreal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. Besides the large American Consulate General, which did the
                    bulk of the consular work in the province and followed business and economic
                    issues, the Soviets had a big post in Montreal, with a major KGB component
                    focused partly, I have heard, on the US. There were many others, mostly
                    interested in business and consular relations.</p>
                <p>The Intergovernmental Affairs Ministry convened them all from time to time for
                    lavish Consular Conferences in Quebec City, at which Levesque would speak to
                    them and they were served excellent lunches or dinners. But I think only the
                    French and we, and possibly the Soviets, followed the PQ's independence campaign
                    in detail.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it unusual to have two Consulate Generals in one

                </p>

                <p>JAEGER: There are often several Consulate Generals in large countries, although
                    in Quebec is the only Canadian province to have two. The reason is that the
                    political center is in Quebec City, where we first sent a Consul during the
                    Civil War to keep tabs on British naval activities, while Montreal has long been
                    a major economic hub. The American Consul General in Montreal is therefore a
                    significant figure in Montreal's context, particularly if he or she is a strong
                    and active personality. In my time it was Mike Reeves, an elegant and very
                    competent Far Eastern expert who, besides the economic and commercial reporting,
                    occasionally contributed political reports. We usually worked well together with
                    minimal overlap.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the usual division of labor between these two
                        posts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Historically, this has changed from time to time. Quebec City has usually
                    been a minor consular post, until separatism made it advisable to send
                    experienced political officers - McNamara, myself and then Lionel Rosenblatt.
                    Since then, wise or not, consular people have again been assigned there as the
                    independence issue has receded.</p>
                <p>c. The run-up to the Referendum</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get back to the main issues. What happened in the
                        run-up to the Referendum and how did you see it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: First, it was important to understand the pressure the PQ was under. They
                    had been in power since 1976 and were in the fourth year of their five year
                    mandate. Levesque had used the preceding years for a wide range of economic and
                    social reforms, including the passage of the famous (or infamous, depending on
                    one's perspective) law 101 defining French as the official language of Quebec
                    and the law governing the financing of political parties.</p>
                <p>Time was beginning to run short and the PQ's foot soldiers were getting restless
                    for action on the central issue of separatism, the PQ's raison d'etre. It was
                    essential therefore, from Levesque's perspective, that the Referendum be held no
                    later than the spring of 1980.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You described how passionate and heated the atmosphere was
                        when you arrived. Did that translate into optimism that they would actually
                        win?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0300" n="Page0300"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Curiously not. While many francophones wanted to separate from Canada,
                    others remained unconvinced. Moreover, the mere prospect of Quebec independence
                    galvanized anglophones and other non-French people into passionate opposition.
                    To understand how passionate, one has to think back on the psychological and
                    practical impact of the new language laws, which led many major corporations to
                    leave Montreal for Toronto and elsewhere and had other damaging effects,
                    particularly for the many people who wanted their children raised in English,
                    not in French.</p>
                <p>In fact things were so unsettled that the Levesque government lost six
                    by-elections in a row, three in close succession during that fall of 1979. I
                    remember reporting to Washington that Levesque was depressed, hectored his staff
                    and blamed the left wing extremists in the PQ for his political setbacks.</p>
                <p>Had the Referendum been held then, my assessment was that the 'Yes' vote would
                    have lost badly, getting, I estimated at best 44%.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you arrive at figures like this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: There were all sorts of polls in the press and people from both sides
                    shared their impressions. I had the further good fortune of getting help from
                    Professor Maurice Pinard of McGill University, a distinguished Quebec
                    sociologist who was the foremost pollster and interpreter of polls in Quebec,
                    with who I had regular lunches in Montreal. So in addition to my conversations
                    with Ryan's people, with Gilles Lamontagne, the Liberal minority leader in the
                    'Assemblee Nationale', who had his finger on the pulse, as well as with my many
                    contacts on the PQ side and elsewhere, I probably had as precise a reading of
                    evolving Quebec opinion over these weeks and months as anyone. Good political
                    analysis is a matter of putting lots of bits and pieces together in a mosaic
                    until they make sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did anything happen which affected your initial
                        assessment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Off course. The most important were the publication of the actual
                    Referendum question just before Christmas and the return of Pierre Trudeau to
                    power in February 1980.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the PQ hadn't decided on what it was going to ask
                        in the Referendum until then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0301" n="Page0301"/>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right, and for several reasons. One was the ongoing internal
                    struggle between the moderate and the more extreme separatists. The latter
                    wanted a more or less straight up or down vote on Quebec independence, whereas
                    the former, headed by Claude Morin and Levesque himself, had a much clearer
                    understanding of the complexity of the knot that would have to be unraveled:
                    Since Quebec and the rest of Canada are linked by all sorts of ties, a shared,
                    currency and central bank, complex tax and subsidy arrangements, defense and
                    foreign policy etc.</p>
                <p>Its for these reasons that Levesque had, from the outset, made
                    'Sovereignty-Association' the battle cry of the PQ, a new sovereignty in key
                    domains, tempered by ongoing association arrangements with Canada which would
                    have to be negotiated.</p>
                <p>What's more there was the not unimportant questions of what the voters might
                    actually accept, since there was no use holding a Referendum on a too extreme a
                    question to please hard liners if it was clear from the outset that it would
                    fail.</p>
                <p>So the precise wording of the question was critically important, both as to its
                    substance and the likelihood of its success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they come up with in the end?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, Claude Morin, Louis Bernard and Daniel Latouche, a young political
                    advisor, struggled with the conundrum, drove Parizeau and others who wanted a
                    straightforward 'yes or no' question up the wall, and, with Levesque making the
                    final changes and decisions, came up, not with a simple question, but a
                    two-stage process:</p>
                <p>First they would only ask the voters in the upcoming referendum, for a mandate to
                    negotiate an agreement with the rest of Canada, “based on the equality of
                    nations..” to “.. enable Quebec to acquire the exclusive power to make its laws,
                    levy its taxes and establish its relations abroad” - in other words sovereignty
                    - “and at the same time to maintain with Canada an economic association
                    including a common currency”.</p>
                <p>No change in political status would be effected until the results of these
                    negotiations had been approved in a second step by a further referendum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds, a bit cumbersome to fire up the faithful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Long and cumbersome it was, and disappointing to those who wanted a more
                    direct question - although Parizeau and the rest of the more radical Pequistes
                    went along loyally once the decision had been made.</p>
                <pb facs="0302" n="Page0302"/>
                <p>Levesque then launched a massive PR campaign in the National Assembly, across the
                    Province and at all levels of society. For the next months Quebec was aflame in
                    campaign rhetoric, flags, posters, rallies and gatherings of all sorts; a fierce
                    contest in which the less frequently seen Canadian flags seemed as outgunned as
                    taciturn Claude Ryan - who, although deeply committed and indefatigable, seemed
                    no match for the avalanche of passionate PQ speeches in advocating the “OUI” for
                    sovereignty-association.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that publication of the question and the PQ's PR
                        campaign affect polls significantly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The polls went up, but, as far as I could gather not quite enough to put
                    the “Yes” vote over the top. The softening of the question and the introduction
                    of a second referendum, I reported to the Department at the time, had reduced
                    anxiety over voting “yes” by making the vote seem less final. Trudeau's
                    election, in a perverse sense, had also been reassuring, since many borderline
                    voters now felt he would not let Quebec go off the deep end. As a result there
                    had been an atmospheric transformation which put the two sides almost
                    neck-and-neck. I estimated that the situation remained volatile, but that the
                    most probable outcome was a narrow defeat of the Levesque forces with the 'Yes”
                    getting between 43 and 47 percent.</p>
                <p>For all his public exhortations, Levesque himself was still uncertain of the
                    outcome at that time. He told me at a dinner at our place in late March that he
                    thought they had a chance to win, but spent more time on the implications of
                    outcomes under a 50% majority than on outright victory. If the result was over
                    45%, he said, he might call a snap election to press home his advantage. If it
                    fell below that he was afraid he would not even be able to claim a moral
                    victory. In his “Memoirs” Levesque cites an internal poll from that same period,
                    which he may have had in mind, in which the “Oui” came in at only 46%, and was
                    supported by only 55% of francophones, clearly below what was needed to put the
                    PQ over the top.</p>
                <p>And that was probably the high point. Toward the end of March Lise Payette,
                    Minister for the Status of Women, called Claude Ryan's wife an 'Yvette', the
                    pejorative nickname for the perfect little pre-feminist housewife. This set off
                    a firestorm of protest, since Madame Ryan was a widely respected woman, and lost
                    the PQ some of the women's vote.</p>
                <p>Then came Trudeau's intense federal counter campaign to impress on Quebeckers the
                    high cost they would incur if they went through with this. Finally, early in
                    May, Trudeau himself appeared in Montreal and Quebec City and made three
                    passionate speeches which had a powerful effect.</p>
                <pb facs="0303" n="Page0303"/>
                <p>Trudeau was not unmindful of Quebec's grievances and issues of cultural identity,
                    having been the main promoter of biculturalism - which meant, inter alia, that
                    as a result of his initiatives all English-Canadian officials had to learn
                    French and many groaned for years trying to memorize French phrases.</p>
                <p>At the same time Trudeau was an unbending federalist. His performances rallying
                    Quebeckers for the 'No” were brilliant and electrifying, and offered them a new
                    constitutional deal of they rejected sovereignty-association and painting a grim
                    picture of their future if they did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to hear any of his speeches?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The one in Quebec - which involved an awkward and, in retrospect, rather
                    funny incident. Having asked for a reserved seat, I presented myself at the
                    auditorium where he was to speak. After some confusion a young usher took my
                    down some corridors, opened a grey door and said, “In here.”</p>
                <p>10 feet from me stood Pierre Trudeau concentrating intensely on the historic
                    speech he was about to give. At a respectful distance, another 10 feet or so
                    behind him, stood his cabinet and other Liberal leaders in equally total
                    silence. Trudeau looked at me and for several seconds said absolutely nothing.
                    After what seemed like an eternity, I finally thought, well, I've got to do
                    something. So I said, “I'm George Jaeger, the American Consul General in
                    Quebec.” There was another awful pause. Finally he said glacially, “I am Pierre
                    Elliott Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I managed to mumble some excuse and beat a hasty retreat, swearing all
                    the way.</p>
                <p>Minutes later Trudeau gave an absolutely rousing speech, which had a considerable
                    impact.</p>
                <p>d. Unexpected crisis: Secretary Vance visits Ottawa</p>
                <p>JAEGER: Throughout the run-up to the Referendum one of Claude Morin's major
                    objectives, as we discussed earlier, was to keep the US as unconcerned as
                    possible to avoid any last-minute Washington reactions which might frighten
                    fence-sitters to vote “No”. Morin, as Jean-Francois Lis�e wrote in his hyped,
                    PQ-slanted book “ In the Eye of the Eagle” on Washington-Quebec relations, was
                    therefore delighted with the continuing “strategic lassitude” of the Americans
                    who did not even seem to envisage the possibility that the “Yes” might win.</p>
                <pb facs="0304" n="Page0304"/>
                <p>Actually, our reporting did not exclude it, but projected a narrow “No” victory
                    as much more probable. Regardless, I again counseled in a now declassified, then
                    secret telegram of April 14 against being drawn into the Quebec-Ottawa contest,
                    even though, I expected, there would undoubtedly be pressures on us to do so.
                    This was all the more important, since the situation remained volatile and the
                    separatism issue would probably re-emerge in the next Quebec election.</p>
                <p>Almost inevitably, the catalyst which brought the issue to the fore was Cyrus
                    Vance's visit to Ottawa on April 23, a month before the Referendum on May 20. A
                    couple of days before his visit one of my colleagues at the Embassy, I think it
                    was Dwight Mason, the Political Counselor, phoned to say that the Trudeau people
                    were urging that Vance make a statement in Ottawa emphasizing our preference
                    that Canada remain united; that it was unclear what Vance would actually do; and
                    suggested that I discreetly warn the Levesque government of this possibility, so
                    that, if he did, it would not come as a complete shock and lead to accusations
                    that we had stabbed the PQ in the back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that would have put the cat among the pigeons!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. I couldn't think of anything worse than for the US to
                    suddenly get in the middle of this fight and get blamed for the outcome,
                    particularly since it seemed so likely that the 'No” side would win in any case.
                    I therefore used a lunch with Richard Pouliot to pass on a low-key warning,
                    stressing that I had consistently urged that Washington not get involved, but
                    that it was obviously up to the Secretary to decide how to deal with these
                    alleged Canadian pressures.</p>
                <p>This apparently rang all the bells, since within hours I was called to a meeting
                    with a visibly agitated Claude Morin, who saw his worst fears of a last-minute
                    US intervention realized. As my recently declassified telegram reported, Morin
                    “earnestly” hoped that the Secretary would finesse the Quebec question during
                    his Ottawa visit, since anything else would produce a wave of anti-Americanism
                    in Quebec, particularly if it was felt that the US had tipped a close Referendum
                    to the 'No'. I made clear that these were precisely the reasons we had decided
                    to alert him and assured him that we would reiterate our longstanding
                    recommendation that the less the Secretary managed to say about the Referendum
                    in Ottawa the better - which I did.</p>
                <p>The next day, April 22nd, Morin called me in again and reiterated his and
                    Levesque's “deep concern” over reports that Secretary Vance planned to make a
                    “strong statement” on Quebec during his Canadian visit, which he said they had
                    now confirmed from their own sources in Ottawa.</p>
                <pb facs="0305" n="Page0305"/>
                <p>Levesque wanted us to know that, if he were to win the Referendum, his real
                    intention, which he had so far not shared with others in the PQ, was to proceed
                    gently, not to provoke any avoidable confrontation with Ottawa, but to carry the
                    technical talks only to the point where Levesque could claim that Quebec had
                    achieved a “special status”. He would even settle for some kind of joint
                    representation in foreign affairs, a far cry from what the independentists
                    expected. Once “special status” could be claimed Levesque would then call his
                    promised second referendum to ratify agreements reached and the “Quebec problem
                    would be solved”. Conversely a 'No' victory would lead to a permanent
                    psychological stalemate, and francophone backlash against anglophones. If Vance
                    made the rumored statement it would be the “first major foreign intervention”,
                    broadly resented, particularly if the 'No' side wins.</p>
                <p>In short - and this is a direct quote from the Secret Night Action telegram I
                    sent to Assistant Secretary George Vest, declassified on April 3, 2001,
                    “Levesque wants us to know in strict confidence that he accepts the fact that he
                    will have to take the half loaf he may be able to get, rather than none, and
                    that Quebec's future should therefore not be a cause for US alarm”.</p>
                <p>At the end of this rather dramatic revelation, I told Morin that I understood and
                    reiterated that I would again advise that we avoid getting involved. As I put it
                    in my telegram, “ we continue to feel that the US will be best served by
                    referring to our standard position clearly but by indirection since... nothing
                    is to be gained by our becoming a party to this emotion laden issue
                    ourselves...”, a recommendation in which the Embassy again concurred.</p>
                <p>Since the Secretary's party was already on its way to Ottawa by the time this was
                    drafted and typed into our antediluvian code machine, I asked in a caption,
                    which the declassifiers subsequently removed, that it be passed to the Secretary
                    on his plane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what actually happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: As it turned out Vance did not raise Quebec in his prepared statement and
                    then deflected a reporter's question about American recognition of an
                    independent Quebec, saying this was “a speculative question on which I do not
                    wish to comment. I have already stated that this is a question for the people of
                    Canada to decide. That is all I wish to say.”</p>
                <p>Either the rumors picked up by our Embassy and by Morin that a much stronger
                    statement was being urged by Trudeau's people were groundless, which I doubt, or
                    our interventions had been effective. In either case, Morin and company should
                    clearly have been pleased.</p>
                <p>e. Lis�e's “psycho-drama”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0306" n="Page0306"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Apparently not. Lis�e's book, which appeared in French and English
                    editions in 1990, argues at length that I must have dreamed up this
                    “psycho-drama” and created this “bizarre incident” to make myself locally
                    important, since Ottawa never intended to seek a strong Vance statement and
                    Vance wasn't really interested in Quebec.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that doesn't square with your report of Morin's
                        statement that they had confirmed these Ottawa pressures from their own
                        sources, and therefore doesn't explain the high level of Levesque's concern.
                        Moreover you sent in these urgent high-level telegrams and no one denied
                        their relevance. What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Exactly. In preparing his book Lis�e had persuaded the State Department
                    to declassify almost all my reporting telegrams from Quebec, virtually the whole
                    kit and caboodle, even though the information was only ten or eleven years old
                    and many of the people who had shared confidences were still active and alive. I
                    was at no point consulted in this process, and remained unaware of it until his
                    book came out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get back to that in a moment. You said that they
                        declassified “almost all” your reporting telegrams.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Almost all. Lis�e didn't get, and was apparently unaware that he didn't
                    get several key messages which were highly classified or marked for very limited
                    distribution, including the two referred to above, reporting my April 21 and 22
                    conversations with Morin.</p>
                <p>As a result he only had a partial impression of what had happened, and no
                    evidence that I had in fact made an exceptional effort to assure that the US did
                    not make a last-minute intervention which could have affected the outcome and
                    got us blamed for the result.</p>
                <p>I should add, in this connection, that the late Professor Jeanne Kissner of SUNY
                    Plattsburgh's Center for Canadian Studies, whose students I had often briefed,
                    vividly recalled that I had once told her this story, and therefore arranged for
                    Lis�e and myself to debate the issue before a meeting of the Canadian Studies
                    Association after the French version of his book came out. She subsequently told
                    me that, after hearing my account, Lis�e' said to her on his way out, “My God, I
                    think this guy is really telling the truth!” However he only toned down and did
                    not correct the subsequent English edition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did these key messages eventually get
                        declassified?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0307" n="Page0307"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Dwight Mason, who had been Political Counselor in Ottawa and was equally
                    outraged by the unfairness of Lis�e's book, succeeded on appeal in getting these
                    messages declassified in 2001. Although George Vest is quoted as telling Lis�e
                    ten years after the fact that he didn't remember this incident, the record
                    clearly confirms the reality of this potential crisis and my efforts to avoid
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Lis�e try to interview you directly at any point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: He phoned me in Vermont after I had retired, I think in 1989, and said he
                    was doing a book on the US role in Quebec. I declined, telling him that the
                    issues were still too sensitive and that my reports on all this were still
                    classified. I wasn't aware of the fact that he already had most of them!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was his book embarrassing to some people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Apart from caricaturing me, what I found most deplorable and mean
                    spirited was that Lis�e castigated Renee Levesque, who had died in 1987, three
                    years before the book was published, for the extent to which he took me into his
                    confidence.</p>
                <p>Levesque certainly liked me. But his frankness, which went beyond beyond what
                    hardline staffers may have thought appropriate, reflected the importance he
                    attached to keeping Washington correctly informed of his assessments and
                    intentions. Lis�e, like Parizeau, whose referendum advisor he became in the
                    mid-nineties, was a more radical separatist than Levesque and used this book to
                    castigate Levesque's moderation - perhaps to promote his own career. After the
                    loss of the '95 Referendum and Parizeau's resignation, Lis�e stayed on as a
                    senior advisor to Lucien Bouchard but left him, reportedly over disagreements
                    over sovereignty strategy. He has also written other derogatory books about
                    Liberal Premier Robert Bourassa, a rather nice man who happened to be a
                    federalist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question on this. Beyond this immediate issue
                        what was the effect of declassifying so much of your reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0308" n="Page0308"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Actually it proved to be quite positive. Even Lis�e's book admitted that
                    we were surprisingly well informed and on the mark. In her April 21, 1990 review
                    of the book for the 'Globe and Mail', Lise Bissonette, the dean of francophone
                    journalists whom I knew well, went further: “ Central to Mr. Lis�e's discoveries
                    are the numerous well informed analyses produced by a string of [American]
                    diplomats...who outdistanced most public comment with their clear and exact
                    views on the issue. .. If Washington never cared to give a helping hand to the
                    'No' forces in 1980, it was because the need was never felt. ....Quebec's US
                    strategy was dismal....”.</p>
                <p>Even so, I thought it important to publish a rebuttal of my own in Quebec City's
                    'Le Soleil', then under the leadership of Morin's former deputy Robert Normand.
                    It appeared that June, albeit in severely pared down form.</p>
                <p>f. Levesque's finest hour?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you sure how the Referendum would come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It became clear about a month before the May 20 Referendum that the PQ
                    would lose, not by a hair but by a substantial margin. This raised concerns in
                    Washington that so great a disappointment in the overexcited, passionate
                    atmosphere prevailing in Quebec could lead to now outbreaks of violence
                    reminiscent of the FLQ (Front de lib�ration du Qu�bec or Quebec Liberation
                    Front) crises of the '70's, when Montreal was plagued by mailbox bombs, James
                    Cross, a British Trade Commissioner was kidnapped and Pierre Laporte, the then
                    Quebec Minister of Labor and Vice Premier, was murdered.</p>
                <p>The Department therefore instructed me to ask for a private meeting with Levesque
                    to discuss these concerns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a bit tricky, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It was. After the Protocol people had left, I tiptoed into the issue by
                    explaining that I had been asked to see him since we had the impression that he
                    wasn't going to win. He said, very candidly, that that was his impression too -
                    although, publicly he was still campaigning hard. I then conveyed Washington's
                    concerns and said that the United States very much hoped that he would do what
                    he could to make sure that things ended peacefully. Levesque said that he too
                    had been thinking about this and asked me to assure Washington that, while he
                    was committed to sovereignty-association, his whole effort as the PQ's leader
                    had been that change had to be brought about by constitutional and democratic
                    means and not by violence. Tell them, he said, that I will do my best.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0309" n="Page0309"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: As we now know, the Referendum was lost by about 40% 'Yes” to 60% “No”,
                    leaving it unclear whether the “Yes” had even carried a simple majority of
                    francophone votes...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: . . unlike the '95 Referendum when they had a strong
                        majority of the francophone population, but still lost by a whisker because
                        the anglophones and others were united behind the 'No'.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. In 1980 the francophones remained deeply divided, so that
                    Levesque couldn't even claim that a decisive francophone 'Yes' gave him a
                    mandate to some limited “restoration work in the old federal homestead”, as he
                    wrote in his Memoirs. Fear had prevailed, fear of the unknown, of failure, of
                    outside retribution. “We hadn't dared”, he wrote sadly, “hadn't been numerous
                    enough to cast off our moorings.” It was a bitter pill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Even so, the PQ convened a huge rally in the Sauve Arena in Montreal that
                    night where Levesque made his perhaps most famous speech. He walked on stage
                    before this vast crowd, a modest, self-deprecating man in baggy pants, as they
                    were cheering, singing and waving a sea of Quebec banners in an immensely moving
                    demonstration which, as everyone knew, marked not victory but the end of an
                    era.</p>
                <p>When things settled a bit Levesque began to speak sadly but calmly, to the theme
                    that Quebec had pursued, but had not been able to achieve its aspirations. But
                    Quebec was a democracy. Quebecers therefore had the duty to respect the will of
                    the majority. This they should do peacefully and well, until the issue could be
                    raised again. He ended, with tears running down his face, waving to the crowd,
                    by telling them, “A la prochaine” (Till the next time).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that was certainly a demonstration of statesmanlike
                        quality, a lot more so than that of his successors ( A reference to
                        Parizeau's outbursts after the Referendum of 1995.)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. It was very moving. The amazing result was that they all
                    went home peacefully. That night at most one or two windows were broken and some
                    gangs roamed the streets yelling and waving flags. But nobody was hurt. Levesque
                    and his deep belief in peaceful democratic change had prevailed, even when he
                    lost.</p>
                <p>There was a sequel. A couple of weeks later I saw Levesque in a receiving line.
                    After I greeted him he said with his little wry smile, “Well, George, does your
                    government think I did okay?”</p>
                <pb facs="0310" n="Page0310"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I said very sincerely, “Mr. Prime Minister, we're very grateful!” He
                    said, “So am I.”</p>
                <p>So that was the end of the first referendum.</p>
                <p>The post-mortems. confirmed that the PQ had failed to reassure a substantial
                    percentage of francophone Quebecers, some of whom feared the economic
                    consequences of separation from the rest of Canada, while others remained torn
                    between their loyalty to Canada and the PQ cause.</p>
                <p>All this, of course, produced the predictable morning-after recriminations,
                    ranging from moderates who blamed Levesque's too complicated and unclear
                    question, to the hard liners, like Parizeau, who still argued rather
                    irrationally, that he should have called for outright separation. For all of
                    them it was a huge emotional set-back in a nationalist struggle which had, in
                    one way or another, been underway for twenty years.</p>
                <p>Symbolic of this time of mourning was Louise Beaudoin's appearance for lunch at
                    the Consulate a day or so after the Referendum.</p>

                        the 'Passionaria'?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right, a thin, intense, amazingly attractive woman, whose green
                    eyes mesmerized a long series of men.</p>
                <p>She turned up in a startlingly revealing T-shirt, with little or nothing
                    underneath, announcing:” Monsieur le Consul General, Je m'en vais a la
                    monastere!” (Consul General, I am going to a nunnery!)</p>
                <p>My cook, who had gone to open the door, was so rattled he dropped his tray of
                    hors d'oeuvres!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, she didn't go into a nunnery. She actually went to work for Air
                    Canada in Paris, then served as a Quebec Minister for implementation of French
                    language Laws, which she did with gusto, and as Quebec's Intergovernmental
                    Affairs Minister. But her depression was symptomatic of the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0311" n="Page0311"/>
                <p>g. Reelection and the Constitutional crisis.</p>
                <p>JAEGER: The next chapters were intertwined and continued to pose major reporting
                    challenges. Almost immediately after the Referendum Trudeau, who wanted to
                    capitalize on Levesque's loss of the Referendum and 'solve' the Quebec problem
                    for good, launched his great constitutional project to “repatriate” the
                    constitution from Westminster: Including his pet project, an American-style Bill
                    of Rights for all Canadians, which would have had the effect of weakening
                    provincial powers in critical areas like, education, culture and over the
                    language issue. Levesque and several other provincial Prime Ministers opposed
                    this perceived infringement of provincial powers from the outset, formed the
                    famous “Gang of Eight” and battled Trudeau for eighteen months.</p>
                <p>I will spare this record a detailed constitutional discussion of the ins and outs
                    of this prolonged and complicated contest which went through several phases:</p>
                <p>The rejection of Trudeau's repatriation proposal by the Newfoundland Supreme
                    Court and its referral to the Canadian Supreme Court.</p>
                <p>The negotiation of the Vancouver formula by the “Gang of Eight Provincial
                    Premiers', which would have provided that any amendment of the Constitution
                    would require approval by the federal parliament as well as by seven provincial
                    legislatures representing 50% of the population; a provision sufficient to
                    protect Quebec and others, in return for abandonment of unilateral provincial
                    'vetoes' - ahuge concession by Levesque.</p>
                <p>The argument as to whether to 'opt' out, a Province would have to have a two
                    thirds majority in its legislature as against a plain majority, as Levesque
                    insisted.</p>
                <p>The Supreme Court's somewhat Delphic decision, which said that Trudeau's project
                    was legal, albeit not in accord with convention.</p>
                <p>Trudeau's last-minute proposal that, if there was no agreement he would settle
                    for repatriation and provide two years to negotiate the Charter of Rights and
                    the amending formula; and, if this failed, a nation-wide referendum would be
                    held, subject, however, to the unlikely prior approval of all the Provinces a
                    tempting proposal which undermined the provinces' common front.</p>
                <pb facs="0312" n="Page0312"/>
                <p>The denouement came on November 5, 1981, when Levesque, Morin and Louis Bernard
                    discovered that all the other provinces had, during the night, agreed to a
                    watered-down deal with Trudeau while Levesque was at his hotel in Hull, a Quebec
                    town across the river from Ottawa. The critical point for Levesque was not only
                    that they had agreed to eliminate financial compensation for opting out of a
                    provision, a point of make or break importance for Quebec, but that the deal had
                    been struck behind his back. Trudeau abetted by a number of other provinces had,
                    in effect, surreptitiously engineered a situation in which the final provisions
                    of the repatriation of the constitution from Westminster was agreed without
                    Quebec's presence and over its objections.</p>
                <p>Levesque stormed out of the meeting, leaving behind a trail of four letter words
                    directed at Trudeau and the other Prime Ministers of Canada and raged for weeks
                    thereafter. The National Assembly and the PQ Press resonated with accusations of
                    stabs in the back, betrayal and so on. It was a critical turning point. From
                    then until Levesque's departure as Premier he was a bitter man. What had been a
                    politically challenging and demanding game for most of the period before the
                    referendum had turned into a sour, vindictive discourse with Trudeau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Quebec ever approve the new Canadian
                        Constitution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: No. When Queen Elizabeth II came to Canada on April 17, 1982 to proclaim
                    Canada's new Constitution, it was the crowning moment for Trudeau. But Quebec
                    was absent, and the Quebec government under neither party has approved it
                    since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said this and other issues were intertwined?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, most importantly the elections which Levesque had called for April
                    1981, unaware that this would also be a critical week in the ongoing
                    constitutional saga.</p>
                <p>Briefly put, Levesque had assumed that, after losing the Referendum, his
                    dispirited PQ would be trounced in the elections as well. As it turned out, our
                    reporting picked up on the fact that Quebec voters made a clear distinction
                    between their views on separatism and their feelings about the PQ as a competent
                    governing party. There may also have been a sympathy vote by francophones who
                    had voted “No” but wanted the PQ to stay in power to push their interests.</p>
                <p>For all these reasons, Ryan's efforts to capitalize on his referendum victory
                    collapsed and the PQ not only won but increased its seats in the National
                    Assembly by 12%, allowing Levesque to stay in power until 1985. In contrast to
                    the Referendum, when the PQ lost 60% - 40%, they won the election with a popular
                    vote of 49.5% against the Liberals' 46%. Even so, the joy was short-lived in
                    view of the brewing constitutional crisis and looming new problems with Quebec's
                    economy.</p>
                <pb facs="0313" n="Page0313"/>
                <p>It all made for fascinating but heavy reporting, which earned all sorts of
                    commendations. If I remember we sent out something on the order of 170 telegrams
                    a year, a huge number considering Irma Scott, my wonderfully competent and
                    patient Secretary and Communications Officer, had to code them all by hand on a
                    rattling World War II vintage code machine.</p>
                <p>h. Other things that occupied our time</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that was certainly a tense and demanding time. What
                        about some of the other issues that you were concerned about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>i. Social Security, acid rain and electric power</p>
                <p>JAEGER: There were all sorts of them. A persistent one, then and during my brief
                    follow-on assignment in Ottawa, was acid rain which adversely affected Quebec's
                    and Canada's forests and lakes. I also helped an expert from Washington
                    negotiate a Social Security Agreement with Quebec, a complex negotiation
                    somewhat inconsistent with our position that we only dealt state-to-state with
                    Ottawa, but necessary due to Quebec's separate social welfare arrangements.</p>
                <p>Another major theme was electricity, since Vermont and the New England
                    electricity people were negotiating a major new long-term contract with
                    Hydro-Quebec. The general feeling was that long term electricity export
                    arrangements between Quebec and the United States were in everyone's interest
                    since we needed the power and the Quebec government was interested in making the
                    most of the surpluses Hydro-Qu�bec was able to produce, although there were
                    differences between them for a while as to how much power it would be prudent to
                    export.</p>
                <p>My role was mainly to make sure that the Commerce Department and other federal
                    agencies in Washington, including the State Department, were carefully kept
                    abreast of these discussions. A side benefit was that I came to know Claude
                    Decoteaux, a thoughtful and kindly young Deputy Minister of Energy, who has
                    remained a lifelong friend. I also had several opportunities to fly up to James
                    Bay to see Hydro-Quebec's installations half way to the Arctic, where existence
                    gets so tough that hundred-year-old trees only achieve a diameter of a few
                    inches. The dams and turbine plants are vast, exploit water reservoirs backed up
                    over hundreds of square miles, and can still be expanded further. Its strange to
                    realize how much of our energy comes from so far away and barren a place and how
                    badly we will all need these clean energy resources in the future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The feeling now is that Vermont paid too much, since
                        electricity prices declined for a number of years.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0314" n="Page0314"/>
                <p>JAEGER: I have heard that said, but everyone at the time thought they had
                    negotiated a reasonable long-term deal. Obviously its hard to foresee how prices
                    will trend over a twenty or thirty year period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever meet Governor Dick Snelling who negotiated
                        this deal for Vermont?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Of course. Snelling was in Quebec city frequently and we became good
                    friends. He was a wonderful bear of a man, broadly informed, pragmatic,
                    articulate and respected. I made a point of being advised by the Protocol people
                    when he was coming and had several delightful lunches and dinners for him and
                    his wife Barbara. I met him again, as we'll see further on, when I was at NATO,
                    and, then when we came to Vermont for my last assignment as Diplomat in
                    Residence at Middlebury College, when he and Barbara had us for a family dinner
                    which he cooked himself!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the PQ try to influence him on the independence
                        question?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Morin's Ministry no doubt wanted to, and sometimes tried to entertain
                    important American visitors without giving them a chance of getting more
                    balanced briefings at the Consulate. But we reached an understanding early on
                    that it was only appropriate that the US representative in Quebec should be made
                    aware of important American visitors.</p>
                <p>Partly as a result, we had constant briefings for visitors, ranging from War
                    College classes, University groups, members of Congress, Governors of New
                    England and other States, journalists, business people and even plain tourists.
                    Although time-consuming, these many visits were also useful pegs for inviting
                    Quebec contacts for receptions, lunches or small gatherings. We even had a
                    California wine tasting once, which was a great success, although the Quebec
                    alcohol monopoly remained unpersuaded and committed to buying primarily French
                    wines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your reference to Governor Snelling raises the question of
                        any relationship you had with the organization of New England Governors and
                        Northeastern Canadian provincial premiers which met regularly every
                        year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I went to several of these meetings. They met, and still meet, each year
                    in a different places to discuss regional issues like transport, commerce,
                    communications, electricity, fishing - whatever needs cross-border
                    communication.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0315" n="Page0315"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, I came to one at Sugar Bush in Vermont.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I was at one in Nova Scotia and then again at Basin Harbor, on Lake
                    Champlain. Besides the fact that the Levesques had a rather loud family argument
                    which kept us awake that night in an adjoining cabin ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: ... that meeting helped mitigate a longstanding, bitter argument between
                    Quebec and Newfoundland over the price Quebec paid for power produced at
                    Newfoundland's Churchill Falls dam and power station.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that all about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: When this installation was first built, Newfoundland had to get Quebec's
                    permission to move this electricity across Quebec to the US market. Quebec drove
                    a hard bargain with Newfoundland's Premier Joseph Smallwood, the father and
                    driving force behind Churchill Falls, resulting in a 75-year deal that
                    Newfoundlanders long considered to be utterly unfair because of the low and
                    unchangeable rate that Newfoundland and Labrador receives for the substantial
                    amounts of electricity bought by Hydro-Quebec.</p>
                <p>So, to get back to the Basin Harbor meeting, all of a sudden a Vermont State
                    Police boat appeared. The premier of Newfoundland, Brian Peckford and Rene
                    Levesque came out, jumped into the boat, and roared off across lake together.
                    Excitement mounted as they stayed out for a couple of hours. As it turned out,
                    it was during this boat ride that the foundation was laid for reconsidering
                    these arrangements and creating a more harmonious relationship between the two
                    provinces.</p>
                <p>ii. Wooing the French elsewhere and in the US.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another subject. What were the PQ's relations with the
                        'Francophonie” and with francophone and other linguistic minorities
                        elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0316" n="Page0316"/>
                <p>JAEGER: The Morin Ministry attached great importance to this and had major
                    programs to strengthen relations and encourage cooperation with other
                    francophone groups, including those in the US, in Maine and Louisiana. Obviously
                    the main emphasis was on their “diplomatic” relations with France and members of
                    the French-sponsored 'francophonoi', which occasionally produced issues with the
                    Canadian foreign office and Canadian Embassies. In addition, I discovered they
                    assisted and encouraged other irredentist movements around the world by giving
                    them how-to-do-it advice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just as the French were advising Quebec City, Quebec City
                        was going to advise others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. I ran across this one day when I walked into the Chateau Frontenac
                    and found to my amazement that it was full of Walloons, Basques and irredentists
                    from the Val d'Aosta in northern Italy and elsewhere. People from Morin's
                    Ministry were giving talks as to how far to push on various issues without
                    getting in serious trouble with their government, how to run effective
                    propaganda operations etc., in effect offering them an irredentist training
                    program. It wasn't a covert effort, but clearly unpublicized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it get into anything you might call abetting
                        terrorism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I would doubt that, given Levesque's strong commitment to achieving
                    independence democratically and within the law. This and related programs did
                    show, however, that there was a broader dimension to PQ separatism, which placed
                    it in the context of mutually supportive independentist or nationalist movements
                    elsewhere. Indeed one of the concepts occasionally discussed during those years
                    was that even the US might, in time, resolve itself into several linguistic
                    entities, predominantly French, English, Spanish etc. which they thought would
                    be helpful to Francophone Quebec.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's fascinating. Did you have any other indications of
                        this sort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. Among our periodic visitors were groups of French-speaking fellow
                    citizens from Louisiana, who made subsidized visits to Quebec and were given
                    talks, not only about the PQ's cause but their own French identity and how they
                    could strengthen it through education, cultural activities etc. to gain greater
                    influence. I always gave a reception for them and found them a very pleasant and
                    lovely group of Americans.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the more ideologically vigorous Independentists in the Ministry
                    somehow kept thinking that if they could just ran more effective programs in
                    Louisiana or in Maine that they might, in time, gain the kind of American
                    domestic constituency for their cause that Israel had gained through parts of
                    the Jewish community in the United States.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any contact between Quebec City and French
                        cultural groups in Vermont, similar to Louisiana, that you know of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, there were, but not on the scale of their efforts in Maine or
                    Louisiana, where they ran quite substantial programs.</p>
                <p>Maine's response to all this was very clever. Joe Brennan, the Governor of Maine
                    at the time, appointed a Special Representative to Quebec, a francophone who
                    came up regularly, called on everyone and facilitated a good deal of Maine's
                    business in the Province. In addition he arranged for large convoys of buses to
                    bring French Maniacs to Quebec Winter Carnival each year and encouraged the
                    Quebec government to put on a good entertainment program for them, so that they
                    would all have a good time. Maine, in effect, joined the party and, while
                    diluting the PQ's political and propaganda, got some of its own business
                    done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about US academia and the media? Were they too
                        propaganda targets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Of course. I first became aware of this when a well-respected Professor
                    of Canadian Studies told me that the Ministry had offered his Institute regular
                    subsidies in return for sympathetic treatment of the separatist cause. I
                    gradually realized that this was not an isolated case, but was part of a
                    systematic program to get friendly treatment from academics and journalists in
                    the Canadian field. I even had a case where an academic had been told that his
                    payments would be reduced, because the Ministry officials involved were
                    displeased with his performance! When asked for advice, which I sometimes was, I
                    would urge them not to take influence money in the first place, although I would
                    not have been surprised if Ottawa had not been doing the same thing on behalf of
                    their cause.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, isn't this done by countries all over the world? The
                        Japanese have been particularly prominent in funding Japanese studies and
                        journalistic coverage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Of course. The point at the time was that Quebec was not a sovereign
                    country but a province in the process of trying to break up Canada, an outcome
                    the US did not favor. While I reported these and other Ministry operations in
                    the US, they were never very effective - even though Morin's people pursued them
                    vigorously as part of their rather grandiloquent effort to 'neutralize' the
                    US.</p>
                <p>iii. American films in Quebec and Canada</p>
                <pb facs="0318" n="Page0318"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Another, more pesky issue involved American films. Both Ottawa and the
                    Levesque Cultural Ministry were pressing for a severe cutback of American films.
                    Quebec not only wanted to reduce our linguistic footprint, even though
                    English-language films were usually sub-titled, but wanted to reduce competition
                    for their small but growing French-language movie industry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is part of the whole Canadian resentment of
                        American cultural imperialism and of the inundation of the Canadian media
                        with American content.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I understood this and personally sympathized to some extent. The trouble
                    was that, as a result of heavy pressure in Washington by our film industry, I
                    had very firm instructions. I was to go around, and rattle doors and try to
                    persuade them to be more reasonable.</p>
                <p>Being a good soldier I did, and in this case, overplayed my hand. I know I
                    annoyed the then Culture Minister and others by repeatedly making our case.
                    After several months of unproductive back and forth I was flying with Levesque
                    to an electricity meeting in the States one day. He looked at me and said, “Look
                    George. We've got your point about films. No Way. Tell your government, and stop
                    yakking about it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I had obviously got under everybody's skin and told Washington that I had
                    done my best. Even so we succeeded in averting de facto expropriation of our
                    film industry in Quebec and contributed to an emerging compromise.</p>
                <p>iv. The 'Landry' incident: No 'triangular' trade</p>
                <p>JAEGER: Then there was the Landry incident. After his devastating constitutional
                    setbacks in '81, Levesque decided that the PQ should make one more determined
                    independence try, which eventually foundered. Even so one of its tactical themes
                    - of encouraging the impression of some kind of new triangular Quebec-US-Ottawa
                    relationships, which would imply a special status for Quebec -produced a minor
                    crisis. As my notes from this period record, I thought I had neutralized this
                    idea in meetings with Morin, Levesque, Parizeau and others. It was further
                    discouraged in a moderately worded Department statement which we prepared and
                    placed in the 'Globe and Mail'. It nevertheless came to head as a result of a
                    public statement by Commerce Minister Bernard Landry early in 1983, suggesting
                    the creation of a Quebec-US-Canada “common market”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a bit ahead of his time, before NAFTA.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0319" n="Page0319"/>
                <p>JAEGER: What Landry promoted was not a Canada - U.S. free trade agreement in
                    which the Province of Quebec would play its part, but a triangular arrangement
                    between Quebec, the US and Canada, as between equals. As such it reflected
                    Quebec's interest in replacing its constricting Canadian trade arrangements with
                    full and unhampered access to the US market; a breakthrough which, as Parizeau
                    once said to me, would give it 'de facto' independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. so what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, as soon as I read Landry's statement I realized that if the US did
                    not respond we would be seen as having passively acquiesced, an acquiescence
                    Landry and others would then exploit further.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which would have made a major step towards
                        separatism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Precisely. I made this point in urgent messages to the Department and
                    Ottawa asking for permission to issue a rather sharp statement, in which the
                    United States repudiated any such idea and reemphasized the traditional policy
                    that we have our relations with Canada, which we hoped would stay strong and
                    united, and not with individual provinces.</p>
                <p>My draft was promptly approved, issued as a press release and made headlines
                    across Quebec and Canada. That the United States should publicly intervene came
                    as a considerable shock to the PQ, and particularly to Landry, who responded by
                    denying that he had ever said what we thought he had said, or at least that he
                    didn't mean it in the way we had interpreted it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he retracted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: In a confused sort of way, yes. Certainly it put an end to that idea, and
                    did not overly damage my own relations with the Levesque government, since, I
                    gathered, even Landry's cabinet colleagues thought he was grandstanding and
                    considered that keeping the peace with Washington was more important than
                    grabbing headlines over hypothetical issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that hurt his career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: May be in the short run. He was certainly very angry with me personally.
                    However, in spite of his reputation as an ambitious, sometimes abrasive eager
                    beaver he was talented and persistent. He became the undisputed number two in
                    Bouchard's government and succeeded him as a not very successful and
                    controversial Premier of Quebec in 2001.</p>
                <pb facs="0320" n="Page0320"/>
                <p>i. Ambassador Robinson's visit and Embassy relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Ambassador ever show up in Quebec during this
                        difficult period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: My first Ambassador, former Maine Governor Ken Curtis, came at least
                    twice after my arrival...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...I remember Curtis. I met him in the '60s when he was a
                        very close friend of Phil Hoff, the then Governor of Vermont.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, he was a very dear man. It was probably because of Curtis's
                    confidence in me that I was able to play the role in Quebec that I played during
                    this time. He could have reined me in and made me clear everything I did.
                    Instead he and Dick Smith, his highly competent Deputy Chief of Mission, gave me
                    wide latitude throughout that period, which Smith continued when Paul Robinson
                    became Ambassador in June 1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More than is usual for a Consul General?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Much more. My understanding is that recent incumbents were told by the
                    Embassy when and what to report, which is, of course, totally counterproductive
                    and inhibiting. Good reporting and analysis, and the development of sound
                    recommendations, are creative acts, tied to one's perception and understanding
                    of the evolution of events...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly in Quebec which is such a distinctive
                        cultural and political community. Ottawa people aren't going to have a very
                        fine sense about it...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I think that's often the case, since the political people assigned there
                    usually don't speak French or have the time or inclination to follow Quebec
                    affairs in any detail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has this been a problem all along, the lack of French
                        language capability in the American Embassy in Ottawa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I shouldn't speak for the present, because I don't know. But
                    traditionally Ottawa has often been used as a place to assign people who, for
                    one reason or another, need to be close to the US, rather than for their
                    language skills. What's more, Embassies usually reflect the atmospherics of the
                    places they are in, in this case Canada's predominantly English culture.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there a certain analogy with the Consulate in Zagreb,
                        when you served there years earlier, since the Croatians had their own
                        ethnic identity vis-a-vis the Belgrade Serbs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Joe Godson in Zagreb also played a fairly strong role in my time there.
                    On the other hand, Tito was in firm national control and Croatia, at that point,
                    was not trying to break away. Moreover, all the substantive officers in Belgrade
                    and Zagreb had Serbo-Croatian language training, so the situation is not really
                    analogous.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: There are lots of situations where we have strong Consulates General,
                    although each is unique and much depends on the context and the personalities of
                    the Ambassador and the Consul General. For instance, as things calmed down in
                    Quebec there was less need to give the post special status. This is reflected,
                    and there's no disrespect intended, by the fact that most recent Principal
                    Officers assigned there have been career consular officers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did things develop after Paul Robinson's arrival?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, it was a new ball game. Robinson, was a big bluff man with a strong
                    personality, given to wearing boots and leather belts with silver buckles. He
                    had a been a naval officer in the Korean war, proud of his work at the time with
                    the Canadian navy. After the war he had founded a large and successful insurance
                    brokerage firm and more recently been Ronald Reagan's Republican finance
                    chairman in Chicago. He often stressed his Loyalist Canadian ancestry, loved
                    English Canada, was a passionate and vocal anti-communist, considered the PQ
                    subversive and often felt compelled to give unsolicited advice to the Canadians
                    - not only in diplomatic circles, but, to the Embassy's distress, on radio,
                    television and what have you. He was also noted for his capacity to drink good
                    whiskey and had a rather nice wife with a somewhat '50ish beehive hairdo. Many
                    Canadians, including many in government, thought he was simply off the wall,
                    although, in spite of his frequent bluster and indiscretions, he produced a sort
                    of love-hate relationship, since people somehow recognized that he really cared
                    about Canada, which was endearing and more than could be said for certain of his
                    predecessors. From the Embassy's and my perspective he was of course a
                    challenge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this raises a question I've had in the back of my
                        mind from some of my own observations at meetings in anglophone Canada, that
                        it is hard for Americans to keep in mind that they're in a foreign
                        country.</hi>

                <pb facs="0322" n="Page0322"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Precisely, and particularly Americans who are not trained to
                    international sensitivities. Robinson was a self-made man in a muscular business
                    and, as Illinois Finance Chairman, had major Republican credentials. He was one
                    of the few people who could pick up the phone and ask to speak to Ronald Reagan.
                    That gives you a lot of moxie. Sometimes after they had talked on the phone, he
                    would come into Embassy staff meetings and say, “Well, I talked to the President
                    last night, and we both agreed that I should make it clear to the Canadians...”
                    The next thing you knew he was on television making whatever it was clear to the
                    Canadians, leaving the rest of us all over Canada picking up the pieces and
                    dealing with the fallout.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have worried what he would say in Quebec during
                        these very agitated periods?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I worried a great deal, and did what I could to delay his visit, arguing
                    that the time wasn't right for this or that reason. My procrastinations, as well
                    as distractions in Ottawa worked for a considerable time with Dick Smith's
                    delicate and important help. Then, in the spring of '82, history took the matter
                    out of my hands when Robinson got himself an invitation to go to sea with the
                    Canadian navy, which he loved. He went off to Halifax, had a wonderful time over
                    several days on the bridge of a Canadian frigate, had himself conveyed to
                    another ship on a breeches buoy in heaving seas, almost fell in, and, with the
                    huzzahs of his naval hosts still reverberating, arrived happily and excited in
                    Quebec.</p>
                <p>I had organized what you might describe as a minor state dinner in his honor,
                    which Levesque mercifully declined, but which did include some of the least
                    ideological or combative PQ Ministers. I studded the rest of the table with
                    polite opposition leaders and other interesting people, like Quebec's Mayor Jean
                    Pelletier, who couldn't possibly give offense, in the hopes that we could
                    somehow get through this dinner mellifluously and without incident. It all went
                    well for a while. Our dining room was resplendent in candle light. The food was
                    superb. And all seemed serene until the very moderate, civilized and
                    pro-American Social Affairs Minister, Pierre-Marc Johnson (who briefly succeeded
                    Levesque following his resignation in 1985) said something about Quebec social
                    policy of which Robinson disapproved and led him to boom across the table, “It's
                    Commies like you who are the reason why the United States is opposed to Quebec
                    independence!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good Lord! There goes all your diplomacy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, not really, because most of them understood this wasn't to be taken
                    seriously and pretended nothing had happened. As for the Ambassador, he enjoyed
                    the dinner thoroughly, and after the guests had left stayed on for what turned
                    out to be some serious drinking.</p>
                <pb facs="0323" n="Page0323"/>
                <p>For me this became the crucial moment, since he had sent word just before going
                    to sea with the Canadians, that, as part of Ronald Reagan's budget cutting
                    drive, he had decided to close down my Consulate General! “This bunch of
                    Commies,” as he put it to me that evening over his third Scotch, didn't deserve
                    a fine officer like me! My task that night was to somehow persuade him otherwise
                    on the grounds that the United States would need this listening post at the
                    heart of francophone Quebec for decades to come and that closing us down, as the
                    British had closed their Consulate, would be a huge tactical mistake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the British were there when you arrived, but they
                        closed down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, also for budget reasons. They concentrated their work in Montreal,
                    which is what he had in mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I am all tenterhooks. You apparently succeeded?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: What followed was one of those wonderful, unforgettable scenes, with the
                    two of us sitting on opposing sofas getting sloshed together. I made my case as
                    best I could until well after midnight, when, with both of us pretty far gone in
                    our drinking, I noticed that he had fallen sound asleep. It was a bit awkward,
                    since I could hardly go to bed and leave the Ambassador sitting there with his
                    big toe protruding from a hole in his sock.</p>
                <p>All of sudden he roused himself, looked at me a little blearily and said, “Okay
                    George, you can keep your goddamn Consulate. I guess we do need you here. You're
                    doing a great job. Keep it up. Keep those Commies in line.” With that he fell
                    asleep again until I put him to bed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: And that's how we saved the American Consulate General in Quebec which is
                    still going strong. Somehow, even though there had been that outburst at dinner,
                    he got the point that having our people there was in fact important for the
                    United States in the long-term. I am sure Dick Smith and others at the Embassy
                    had helped as well.</p>
                <p>The remarkable thing was that Ambassador Robinson seems to have respected me for
                    the hard fight I had put up, which a year or so later led him to invite me to
                    come to the Embassy as his Political Counselor. Of that, more later.</p>
                <p>j. Rebuilding the Consulate and learning to manage</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0324" n="Page0324"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We haven't talked of the management side of things. Was
                        that a challenge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: One of the first things which struck me when I arrived was the condition
                    of our offices. The building itself is as an architectural gem, wonderfully
                    sited across a little park from the Chateau Frontenac and fronting on the
                    boardwalk of the St. Lawrence River. Its shell goes back to the 18th century but
                    was extensively modified, expanded and restored in the late '30s or early '40s
                    to suit the needs of a small consular outpost of that time. Nothing much had ben
                    changed to the time I arrived. The Consular office was still a rather small
                    space, dominated by the long green linoleum counter which confronted you as you
                    came in from the park side, then the building's only entrance; behind which our
                    four local employees performed their consular tasks, totally unprotected. On one
                    side was a little office for the consul and the vice-consul. On the other, a low
                    swinging double door like in a bar, led into a larger room, the equally
                    unprotected inner sanctum of the Consul General.</p>
                <p>There were other problems besides lack of security and privacy for people being
                    interviewed. In the winter, and often in the spring and fall as well, our floors
                    were a sea of slippery slush or mud, since everyone came in with dripping boots
                    and overcoats; and, since there was no adequate waiting space, the place was
                    often overcrowded and so smelled to high heaven. In short the consulate was
                    hardly representational, was inefficiently arranged and left all of us without
                    protection against any troublemaker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there ever any incidents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: One very close call when a Quebec film company was making a movie, 'The
                    Plouffes', a spoof about the lives of a very typical Quebec family. We had
                    agreed to let them put up an antenna on our roof, which they needed for some
                    technical reasons for shooting some scenes on the boardwalk outside. I had
                    forgotten all about this, when one day a tough-looking guy in a black turtleneck
                    sweater, black trousers and black shoes burst into my office and without further
                    explanation shouted, “Take me up to the roof! Take me up to the roof!”</p>
                <p>I had a tear gas spray can in my right hand drawer, my only security device. I
                    reached for it, having no idea what this was about, and almost knocked this guy
                    out, until it dawned on me that he was talking about the film antenna on the
                    roof. I said, “Are you from the film company?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Yes, of course. Hurry up! Hurry up! It's not working, and they're
                    filming!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0325" n="Page0325"/>
                <p>JAEGER: I said, “Buddy, you are very lucky that I realized this in time!” In an
                    age when there were real risks of terrorism, particularly in Quebec's then
                    hyper-charged atmosphere, the incident underscored that we were hardly
                    secure.</p>
                <p>So, for all the above reasons I worked up a plan to turn our offices into an
                    attractive, secure and efficient space. The key was to make use of our extensive
                    unused basement, which was a warren of storage rooms, full of newspapers and
                    files going back to World War II, when the Consulate General had played a key
                    role because of the critical importance of the St. Lawrence for US naval and
                    submarine units fighting in the Atlantic. We found all sorts of records,
                    newspaper files, photos and clippings - which I hope have been preserved - of
                    American and Canadian naval officers and, of course, of social events
                    surrounding the Quebec Conference itself, with Roosevelt and Churchill.</p>
                <p>Once we had cleared this space, the plan was to convert this lower floor into the
                    new Consular office, by giving the building a second public entrance on 'Terasse
                    Dufferin' on the river side of our steeply sloping building. I will spare you
                    the details of this process, except to say that in the end we pretty much did
                    the design work ourselves and used an architect primarily for technical issues
                    like plumbing, wiring and so forth.</p>
                <p>To get there proved to be a long process. Obtaining the half million dollars we
                    needed from Washington, working out all the security wrinkles, i.e. the number
                    of bullet proof glass doors with high security locks we would need, having
                    everyone agree to our plan, hiring contractors and getting the actual work done
                    all took considerable time.</p>
                <p>When, I think it was in 1982, it was finally finished, the upstairs had became a
                    quiet, modern, airy and secure work and reception area, while all the consular
                    work took place in the wholly redesigned, modern and efficient space on the
                    floor below, which now had its own secure door for the public. I was especially
                    pleased with some of the minor touches, which added elegance: The grey stone
                    wall in the otherwise modernistic consular section evoked the material used in
                    many of the buildings of Old Quebec. And the original National Geographic
                    photographs of great American scenes which the Society generously, and
                    exceptionally, donated, made our now elegant first floor waiting and conference
                    space outside the Consul's and Consul General's offices particularly attractive.
                    In sum, it all came out better than we had hoped.</p>
                <p>We had a block party for the formal opening on Terasse Dufferin and invited
                    everyone on our guest lists, as well as Dick Smith the DCM in Ottawa.</p>
                <pb facs="0326" n="Page0326"/>
                <p>It was a huge success, there was Quebecois music, lots to eat, everyone had fun
                    and liked our new offices. For some reason which I don't remember, Jacques-Yvan
                    Morin, Claude Morin's rather fussy successor, was the only one who refused to
                    come because he was momentarily offended about something the US had said or
                    done. Our DCM, Dick Smith, said to me on leaving, “You know, I knew this was a
                    tough post, but I didn't realize how tough it was until today!” I appreciated
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was certainly a major accomplishment. How about staff
                        morale? Was that ever a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Only occasionally. Quebec's long, very cold winters are hard and
                    confining. And we all worked very hard. But we had TGIF's (thank God it's
                    Friday), the American staff often participated in and contributed substantively
                    to the post's entertainment or joined Pat and myself at drinks or family
                    dinners. Eric Boswell, my number two when I arrived, spoke good French, which
                    was important, and had developed a wide social circle in Quebec where he and his
                    wife were quite at home. His successor, was I think the least happy, feeling
                    that hers was a largely consular job, which she did well, but she never really
                    lived her way into the charms and complexities of francophone Quebec.</p>
                <p>Betsy Anderson, the last of my three Consuls, was the most successful and
                    outgoing of the three. She took a lively interest in Quebec issues and politics,
                    was not shy about speaking and improving her French, related easily to people
                    and often told me the latest joke, or gave me an earful, when she thought I was
                    becoming too involved. She particularly distinguished herself one blustery
                    winter night when a Greenpeace crew was arrested and jailed for allegedly
                    interfering with a seal hunt somewhere far out on the St. Lawrence. She
                    insisted, with my very reluctant consent, on flying out there that night in a
                    small plane, in spite of a pending snow storm, because, as she put it, helping
                    Americans in distress “is my job”. What's more she sprung them!</p>
                <p>She also earned my gratitude for her sensitive and effective management of the
                    consular staff and for setting a fine example to two successive Vice Consuls,
                    one of whom, Frank Urbancic, a genial young man, went on to Arabic training and
                    a Baghdad assignment after Quebec. Another, was also nice but less successful,
                    having, for one thing, never mastered the skill of writing a coherent page.</p>
                <p>The heart of the post, as always, were our five local employees who
                    uncomplainingly managed the brunt of the consular work and almost never failed
                    us. My hero of the lot, however, was Mr. Cote, my good hearted old driver and
                    the post's jack-of-all trades who knew how to fix everything, opened and closed
                    the doors, raised the flag and had the gift of getting our rattly car going even
                    at twenty below zero.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever get recognition for your work in Quebec?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I was on the promotion list to FSO-2 in 1980 and, after the Senior
                    Foreign Service was created was reappointed in '81 to the new rank of Counselor
                    (FE-OC). The Embassy also nominated me for the Director General's Award for
                    Reporting, and before I left Canada I was awarded another Superior Honor Award
                    for my work in Quebec. In addition Assistant Secretary for African Affairs
                    Chester Crocker twice nominated me for Ambassadorships, once for Dakar and then
                    for Niger, which I much appreciated even though they did not materialize.</p>
                <p>l. To the North Pole with the Governor General.</p>
                <p>JAEGER: The Canadian government too had apparently been aware of my work in
                    Quebec, perhaps through some less-than visible local listening post. Be that as
                    it may, somebody from the Prime Minister's office called me up out of the blue
                    one day, I think in '82, and said that they had been admiring my work and
                    wondered if I would accept a Canadian decoration for my service before I went on
                    to a new job. Needless to say, I was amazed, partly because I had had no inkling
                    that Ottawa was following what I was doing and partly because I thought I had
                    been as even-handed as possible within the framework of US policy and the
                    evolving situation.</p>
                <p>I explained that I was, of course, very appreciative but that American diplomats
                    have not accepted foreign decorations since the time of Thomas Jefferson. My
                    caller then asked if there was anything else Canada could do to express its
                    appreciation for the work I had done, because Prime Minister Trudeau “really
                    would like to do something for you.” Well, I replied, if one of your military
                    aircraft going up to the high arctic ever had an empty bucket seat I would
                    certainly enjoy riding along; and thought no more about it.</p>
                <p>Months later I got a call from an aide-de-camp in the Governor General's office,
                    who, to my total amazement, said that Mr. Schreyer the Governor General of
                    Canada, wanted me to join him on a ten day trip to the High Arctic, beyond
                    Baffin Island to a landing near the North Pole! Would I be able to accept and be
                    at an airport in Manitoba on Thursday of that week at eight in the morning?</p>
                <p>I explained that, if the Department gave me permission to leave my post - which
                    it did - I would, of course, be delighted and, within a few days, set off on
                    this absolutely incredible trip on the Governor Generals' well-appointed plane.
                    Governor General Schreyer, an urbane man of many interests, including a passion
                    for the plight of the Inuits whose champion he became, welcomed me amiably,
                    explained what we were going to do and introduced me to the others. Besides Mr.
                    Schreyer, who was a former International Relations Professor, leader of the New
                    Democratic party and Premier of Manitoba, and his lovely wife Lily, our small
                    party consisted of several of personal relatives and friends and one other
                    'official guest'.</p>
                <pb facs="0328" n="Page0328"/>
                <p>Our first stop was Resolute Bay, the 'cross-roads' of the Arctic, a functional,
                    rather bare settlement which, as our trip progressed came to seem larger and
                    more comfortable the farther north we went. We spent the night at a surprisingly
                    cozy arctic 'Inn' in a small Inuit village about ten miles outside of town,
                    which consisted of a couple of comfortably furnished connected Quonset huts, and
                    was run, of all things, by a young Mauritian engineer married to an anglophone
                    Canadian. Together they had created this well-equipped jumping-off place for
                    arctic tourist expeditions they organized, ranging from dog-sled outings of a
                    few days to two weeks favored by German tourists, to adventure flights to the
                    North Pole - whose exact location - since you had to know where to pop the
                    champagne - was always marked by a barber pole .... which I found leaning
                    outside the door.</p>
                <p>From there we visited the haunting sites on nearby Beechey Island, where Sir John
                    Franklin's expedition perished in its winter encampment in 1851, as well as the
                    world's then most northern (Cominco) nickel mine (now closed), whose modernistic
                    office and housing buildings seemed utterly incongruous on the vast frozen
                    landscape of Little Cornwallis Island, where polar bears frequently looked in
                    through the heated swimming pool windows!</p>
                <p>Then it was on to Pond Inlet and other Inuit villages on the West coast of Baffin
                    Island, where Mr. Schreyer, a longtime critic of Ottawa's discouragingly
                    unsuccessful Inuit policies, spent time in village meetings to see how things
                    were going.</p>
                <p>In all of them we encountered the same tales of resistance to modern lifestyles,
                    underemployment, alcoholism etc. and were welcomed and feted with Inuit songs
                    and local delicacies, particularly the blubber women scraped for us from seal
                    skins - a remarkable learning experience in stark contrast to the extraordinary
                    cuisine on the CG's plane, where a chef prepared brilliant meals and offered
                    some remarkable wines to match.</p>
                <p>The next stop, the American missile warning base at Thule in northern Greenland,
                    couldn't have presented a greater contrast with its vast radar arrays and
                    comfortable, high-tech military installations. We had the VIP tour, were given a
                    splendid steak dinner by the Commanding Officer but, most of all, enjoyed the
                    hot showers in our billets.</p>
                <p>We then flew back to northern Baffin Island for a visit to the Nanisivik zinc and
                    lead mine (it too now closed), an outpost 750 km north of the Arctic Circle
                    where hundreds of Canadians and others lived and worked in igloo-like structures
                    in a cold northern moonscape, and kept their morale up by watching American
                    football on their TV sets and eating to their hearts content in a vast dining
                    hall open 24 hours a day!</p>
                <pb facs="0329" n="Page0329"/>
                <p>I remember walking to the south end of the camp after dinner - it was a glacially
                    cold and star-filled night - and looking out at the white emptiness beyond. A
                    miner, whom I hadn't noticed at first, said out of the dark, “You know there
                    isn't another human that way for 600 miles!” The arctic, in its emptiness and
                    vastness, is a metaphysical experience, which is not for everyone. We also made
                    a short visit to a nearby Inuit village where an elder, who sadly deplored the
                    passing of the old ways and took us out to show us how seal fishing is
                    traditionally done by patiently waiting with your harpoon at a hole in the ice.
                    I recall that my feet got desperately cold!</p>
                <p>The last leg was a three hour flight still further north, along the massive
                    length of beautiful, mountainous and glacier-covered Ellesmere island, to Alert,
                    the northernmost permanently inhabited place on earth, and the site of a huge
                    Canadian signals intelligence base; so highly secure that I was even accompanied
                    to the bathroom by an armed guard. The name of the game was to detect Soviet,
                    and probably also American submarines playing games under the Polar Ice cap. The
                    weather there is often so severe that there are ropes between all the buildings
                    to help guide people to safety if they are caught outside in storms and large
                    signs requiring them to stay wherever they are, for days if necessary, when
                    storms do sweep across the base.</p>
                <p>At Alert we left the Governor General's aircraft for the last leg north on a
                    rattling pontoon-equipped Twin Otter and landed on an ice floe some 200 km from
                    the magnetic North pole. We jolted to a rough stop near the camp site of a
                    Canadian expedition which was trying to prove that a spur of globular mineral
                    deposits on the seabed eight or ten thousand feet below the ice was made of the
                    same stuff as one emanating in that direction from the nearest land. If so,
                    Canada hoped it could claim sovereignty over that part of the polar sea under
                    provisions of international law which, at this writing, are again in play as the
                    Russians and the other arctic powers are trying to stake similar claims to the
                    mineral resources under the currently fast-melting polar ice cap. As it turned
                    out the results were anti-climactic from a Canadian point of view, since the
                    deposits being winched up through a large hole in the ice proved definitively
                    that the deposits below were different.</p>
                <p>Even so, it was an exceptional experience to see the expedition at work under
                    these very tough conditions. Their entire camp had been blown down by a storm
                    three weeks earlier and had had to be reconstructed. Even now that their
                    sleeping and dining tents were operational again, life was hardly a picnic in
                    the bitter-cold polar vastness. Even going to the bathroom behind a snowdrift
                    was a continual endurance test, while life and work inside the crowded tents was
                    hot, muggy and often raucous. At one point I found someone tugging at my sleeve.
                    It turned out to be an American girl from somewhere in Florida who asked:
                    “Please sir, can you tell me what in hell I'm doing here? I want to go
                    home!”</p>
                <p>Before climbing back on our Twin Otter the Governor General congratulated this
                    crew of scientists, cooks, handymen and admin people for their courage and good
                    work in a short speech recorded by the National Geographic photographer covering
                    the expedition.</p>
                <pb facs="0330" n="Page0330"/>
                <p>Back on the GG's plane in Alert we began the long flight back to Manitoba with a
                    particularly brilliant meal served with vintage Bordeaux. It had been an
                    extraordinary trip.</p>
                <p>m.Leaving Quebec</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That all sounds like a great adventure. And then you left
                        Quebec for Ottawa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes in August 1983. Ambassador Robinson , with whom I had fought so hard
                    to keep Quebec in business, had clearly come to like and respect me and asked me
                    to be his Political Counselor in Ottawa for a year. I agreed, albeit with some
                    reluctance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Leaving Quebec must have been an ambivalent
                        experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It was, although after four years it was clearly time to move on. The
                    great issues of sovereignty-association and the constitution had been settled,
                    at least for the time being, and it was time for someone new to take up the
                    post. My successor, Lionel Rosenblatt, had distinguished himself in resettling
                    over a hundred thousand Vietnamese refugees, and had made major humanitarian
                    contributions to Khmer refugee resettlement. He became a nationally known figure
                    after he left the Foreign Service in 1990 as President of Refugees International
                    which helped large numbers of refugees in Bosnia, Rwanda and many other global
                    trouble spots.</p>
                <p>Still, there were good-byes to be said to the many we had worked with and some
                    who had become close personal friends: Like Mayor Jean Pelletier, who, with
                    extraordinary skill had navigated Quebec City's fortunes through the clashing
                    political forces of the time and actually managed to make the place flourish
                    with support from both Ottawa and Rene Levesque. Quebec City's attractive new
                    port and waterfront are among his accomplishments. Pat and I often saw Jean and
                    his thoughtful and wise wife Helene, and have continued our friendship over the
                    years since he was, and then retired as, the powerful Cabinet Director to his
                    friend Prime Minister Jean Chretien. When I left Quebec, he said, “George, a
                    friendship is a conversation which can be interrupted for years and then taken
                    up again exactly where it left off”. We have often resumed.</p>
                <pb facs="0331" n="Page0331"/>
                <p>There was James DePreist, the now famous African-American conductor, who in later
                    years was to raise the Oregon Symphony to world status. At the time he was Music
                    Director of the then rather anemic Quebec Symphony Orchestra, struggling with
                    inadequate budgets and latent prejudice because he was not a francophone,
                    although he had mastered the language in short order and even written a small
                    book in French! The nephew of Marian Anderson, and a prot�g� of Leonard
                    Bernstein, he had contracted polio on a USIA tour to Thailand, which left both
                    his legs useless and forced him to conduct perched on a thin metal chair. He was
                    a huge capacious man, warm, passionate and intensely perceptive. He and his
                    lovely Quebecois wife Ginette became and remained lifelong friends. I will never
                    forget his struggle to perform Mahler's 8th Symphony in Quebec, a vast work
                    requiring many more performers than his Board would sanction. So he went out to
                    high schools and colleges, collected a pick-up crew of promising young
                    musicians, rehearsed them intensively for three months, and then put on an
                    overwhelmingly powerful performance which left his audience cheering! He was by
                    far our best Ambassador!</p>
                <p>There were others who had become part of our lives, including General Francois
                    Richard and his wife Marie, the first-rate commander of Vallecartiers, the
                    Canadian Army base outside Quebec City, who had taken me out on winter maneuvers
                    and helped me understand Quebec from the perspective of francophones who are
                    also passionate Canadians. We were to meet again shortly when he, as a two star,
                    became Canada's representative on NATO's Military Committee.</p>
                <p>Lastly, there was, of course, Rene Levesque, whom I had probably cost a percent
                    or two in the referendum and sometimes differed with on other issues. He
                    received me late one afternoon in his office for my good-bye call, to my
                    surprise surrounded by his wife, Corinne, and a dozen or so other PQ
                    heavyweights, dressed in his favorite safari jacket, with a bottle of Scotch
                    before him on his desk.</p>
                <p>After I had thanked him for his many kindnesses to me, he looked at me with a
                    little grin and said, “You know, George, you are a son of a bitch, but you are
                    my favorite son of a bitch!” We had an odd but real friendship, and knowing him,
                    not as the 'bete noir' he was to so many English Canadians, but as a
                    three-dimensional Quebec nationalist who passionately saw to it that his
                    movement remained constitutional and democratic, had been a revelation.</p>
                <p>The Levesque I remember was a warm, caring, vulnerable man of enormous talent and
                    many human failings, who had a pretty clear vision of the world, just wanted to
                    right the wrongs that had been done to French Quebec, but ran into forces he
                    could not democratically overcome. When I am in Montreal these days and cross
                    Avenue Rene Levesque I still see him clearly, a charming, self-deprecating,
                    vulnerable and indomitable leader, a clown, laughing or sad, gesticulating with
                    his endless cigarettes, and inspiring his people when he spoke to them from the
                    heart in language that moved and which they could understand.</p>
                <pb facs="0332" n="Page0332"/>
                <p>5. Counselor in Ottawa</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you were off to your new job in Ottawa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Oddly enough, once again by car! We found a lovely old brick house on
                    Prince Street in Rockcliffe, the 'nicest' suburb of Ottawa, Christina was
                    happily enrolled in nearby Elmwood School and so settled quickly into Ottawa's
                    comparatively serene routine. As Political Counselor I now had much greater
                    scope than I had had in Quebec, since I was now responsible for all the issues
                    which affected Canadian political relations with the United States, Canadian
                    domestic politics and following Canadian issues globally. Since we were in
                    substantial agreement on many of them, and some of the more difficult issues
                    were handled by the Department and the Canadian Embassy in Washington, the
                    workload was large but manageable.</p>
                <p>Even so, I was limited by the fact that I was a one man band, having at most one
                    junior officer to help on a sporadic basis. There was also awkwardness from the
                    outset in my relations with John Rouse, the new DCM who had succeeded my friend
                    and mentor Dick Smith, a nice precise man with sharp pencils and polished
                    eyeglasses who, as Pat said perceptively, was a 'beige' personality. Although a
                    veteran of Canadian affairs, he somehow lacked 'grandezza del animo' and tended
                    to do things impeccably but by the book.</p>
                <p>My relationship with the Ambassador, on the other hand, was more productive,
                    since, in spite of our diametrically different world and political views, he
                    clearly liked me and trusted my advice. I would see him frequently, often using
                    his backdoor, which bypassed the front office, for a private chat; and was on
                    several occasions able to talk him out of explosive statements he wanted to make
                    which would again have rocked the Canadian scene. Part of this perilous
                    balancing act involved invitations to the Residence, either for official
                    occasions or for more private evenings with a few other key people. The image
                    which sticks in my mind is of this big, bluff man wearing a train conductor's
                    cap, delivering his guests' drinks with a hoot and a clang of the bell of his
                    super-sized toy railway which coiled through every room on the Residence's
                    second floor! It was the talk of Ottawa!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He sounds like the model political appointee! On a
                        different note, did people in Ottawa seem interested in your experience in
                        Quebec?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I am glad you asked. Tony Price and his wife, who were among the
                    remaining 'anglo' aristocracy in Quebec City, had given us a farewell party at
                    their lovely place on the Isle d'Orleans, at which they asked if we knew anyone
                    in Ottawa and kindly offered to drop a line to introduce us to some of their
                    friends. As a result, we had a number of very elegant and high-level invitations
                    shortly after our arrival.</p>
                <pb facs="0333" n="Page0333"/>
                <p>What became apparent at all of them was that most of the anglo-Canadian elite
                    didn't really understand or, for that matter, like Quebec. I particularly
                    remember a sparkling dinner party with several Deputy Ministers and other
                    'Mandarins' at which our rather famous host turned to me and said, “Well, Mr.
                    Jaeger, you have just spent some time in Quebec, tell us about it” - as if
                    Quebec were a subsection of Baluchistan! I couldn't help my probably impolite
                    reply, “ But Minister, this is your country. I should ask you that
                    question!”</p>
                <p>To be fair, there were many Canadians who followed the issue fairly and with real
                    interest. Even so, Ottawa confirmed the adage that Canada consists, or at least
                    consisted, of 'Two Solitudes'.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's sort of what I expected, What was the Foreign
                        Office like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That was also a bit of a shock, since we were not received with the kind
                    of warmth you would have expected, given the general friendship between
                    Canadians and Americans.</p>
                <p>The Canadians certainly are our closest allies and biggest trading partners and
                    share our longest open border. Even so, official contacts were generally
                    cautious, since the Foreign Office people consistently tended see us as the big
                    elephant - we were at the time 250 to their 25 million people - which, when it
                    coughs, can give them pneumonia. So no matter what the issue was, they wanted to
                    make quite sure that they would not be perceived as knuckling under and that we
                    dealt with them as equals. I gradually learned to expect that chip on the
                    shoulder, but it took some getting used to. By contrast, once you were with
                    people outside of the Foreign Office realm, relations could not have been warmer
                    and more friendly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Acid rain, fisheries and our joint projects in the Great Lakes, somewhat
                    in that order.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Acid rain certainly was a major concern in that period,
                        here in Vermont as well. How did it play out in Ottawa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0334" n="Page0334"/>
                <p>JAEGER: There were endless, sometimes animated and even angry high-level meetings
                    with senior EPA officials and Deputy Assistant Secretaries, like Tom Niles, who
                    came up from Washington. Much of the talk was technical, but nothing much was
                    resolved, partly I suspect because the Reagan administration wasn't really
                    willing to take on the American polluters and was stalling. The Canadians did,
                    in time, establish an acid rain regime in their country which has helped. But it
                    was not till 2002 that we were to conclude a US-Canadian Air Quality agreement
                    which, together with other initiatives, has helped to mitigate this problem to
                    some extent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the other issues as frustrating?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Pretty much. The complaints and recriminations of the salmon fisheries on
                    both sides of the Pacific border precipitated ongoing discussions without, in my
                    time at least, achieving major breakthroughs. We also had to deal with large and
                    small Great Lakes issues, which laid the groundwork for negotiations in the
                    binational Great Lakes Commission, a slow process which occasionally produced
                    significant results</p>
                <p>As to the ongoing battle over cultural relations, i.e. the controversial issue
                    American film and magazine exports to Canada, this proved not to be as demanding
                    as in Quebec since much of it of it was handled by the USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the big east-west issues like arms control,
                        which was a major theme in the 1980s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: We were only tangentially involved. Occasionally Washington would ask us
                    to talk to the Canadians about some aspect of the arms control negotiations or
                    the coordination of some position in NATO, the UN or in some other international
                    forum. A highlight was Paul Nitze's visit to brief the Canadians on his INF
                    (Intermediate Nuclear Force) discussions with the Soviets, one of my heroes whom
                    I had come to know first as an intern and later when I was Staff Director of the
                    McCloy Committee. He spoke brilliantly for almost two hours without notes and
                    gave all of us an object lesson of what excellence in this business is all
                    about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the issue of Canadian dealing with Cuba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It's interesting you should ask that, although I can't recall that we did
                    much finger wagging. I think their enthusiasm for Cuba had waned a bit by
                    then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was also a time of great change on the domestic front
                        in Canada.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0335" n="Page0335"/>
                <p>JAEGER: That was our main focus, since we witnessed the decline of Trudeau and
                    rise of Brian Mulroney, who was elected Prime Minister in September '94 with the
                    largest majority in Canadian history. A powerful rising star, this anglophone
                    Quebecker had defeated accident-prone, pigeon-chested Joe Clark, to become
                    leader of the Conservative Party in June of '83, to the delight of and with,
                    some thought, quite excessive public support of Ambassador Robinson and the
                    Reagan administration in Washington. Be that as it may, these months were
                    largely consumed with reporting of the evolving trends, while Robinson was
                    unabashedly beating the drums in and outside the Embassy for the
                    conservatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Consulates General across Canada play a big role
                        in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Very much so. There was a steady stream of reporting from Winnipeg,
                    Vancouver, Calgary, Montreal, Quebec and Halifax, as well as much discussion at
                    the annual Principal Officers' Conference, held that year in the Hotel
                    Montebello outside Ottawa, where we could all get together and exchange
                    impressions. The one that stood out that year was our Consul General in Halifax,
                    usually a backwater staffed by lesser lights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Halifax?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. Our colleague in Halifax, whose name I am very embarrassed to say I
                    can neither recall nor locate, had just arrived there. He was virtually blind,
                    had a related nervous disorder and was a beneficiary of new legislation
                    prohibiting discrimination against physically handicapped people. The Department
                    provided him with an optical reader, which enlarged letters to a huge size and
                    gave him an additional staff member to read things aloud to him. We were all
                    dubious whether, even with this support, he would be able to manage during a
                    politically very active time. In fact, as I said, he turned out to be the best
                    Consul General of the lot!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: What's more, he had, in his second marriage, married a woman who was also
                    blind! In the weeks after his arrival he went out and visited every Premier in
                    the Maritimes, got to know lots of the cabinet members, business and ordinary
                    people throughout the Provinces and did a voluminous amount of excellent,
                    insightful reporting - in great contrast to his physically splendid, but
                    otherwise lazy predecessor. What's more his blind wife gave skiing instructions
                    (!) to the blind and handicapped, and was equally involved. They were both a
                    great success in the Maritimes and to us an inspiration!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you want to extend your assignment in Ottawa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Not really. I had been in Canada since 1979 and it was time to move on.
                    Various assignments were dangled before me, none of which had much appeal until
                    I was asked if I would like to compete for the job of Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    General of NATO for Political Affairs, working on the staff of Lord Carrington
                    who had just been made Secretary General. I got the job after a two-hour
                    interview in Brussels chaired by my boss-to-be Fredo Dannenbring, a senior
                    German diplomat, the then Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs.</p>
                <p>Chapter IX - Deputy Assistant Secretary General at NATO and Diplomat
                    -in-Residence at Middlebury College</p>
                <p>1. On Carrington's staff at NATO</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that sounds like an exciting turning point in your
                        career. When did you take up your new job in Brussels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Pat, Christina, by now a young lady of thirteen, and I arrived in
                    Brussels in April '84 and were assigned a lovely large house on Val de la
                    Futaie, off Avenue Franklin Roosevelt near the Bois de la Cambre, a quiet
                    charming little square where we only gradually met our somewhat retiring
                    well-off Belgian neighbors. Christina was enrolled in St. John's International
                    School, one more challenging change, and dealt with it by rapidly exchanging her
                    Quebecois for a Bruxellois accent and making new friends.</p>
                <p>The NATO building where I was to work, was the same vast former military
                    barracks, converted to accommodate the then sixteen NATO delegations and the
                    Secretary General's large headquarters staff, to which NATO transferred after de
                    Gaulle asked it to leave France. Its nondescript appearance did not adequately
                    convey that this was the nerve center of the great alliance which fought and was
                    shortly to win the Cold War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a bit about your new job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The Deputy Assistant Secretary General's (DASG) job in the NATO
                    Secretariat's Political Division has traditionally been an American position,
                    its role and importance depending a great deal on the incumbent, the
                    effectiveness of his boss, the Assistant Secretary general (ASG), and the extent
                    to which Secretaries General wanted to make use of these resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe we should first take a quick overall look at how
                        NATO is organized, to get this right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0337" n="Page0337"/>
                <p>JAEGER: OK. NATO has, from the outset, had a Secretary General who chairs and
                    leads Council Meetings at the Ministerial and Foreign Ministers levels and is
                    generally responsible for the management and operations of the alliance. To this
                    end he has a Secretariat, which, in my time, consisted of the Deputy Secretary
                    General, their small, powerful shared front office assistants, known as the
                    'Private Office' and, below them, a number of major functional Divisions: The
                    Political Division - my new niche, a Division for Defense Planning and Policy,
                    another for Defense Support, a Nuclear Planning Directorate a Division of
                    Infrastructure, Logistics and Civil Emergency Planning, a Scientific Division,
                    an Administrative Division and an Executive Secretariat, all headed by ASGs or
                    equivalent.</p>
                <p>The purpose of these Divisions was to backstop the Secretary General with
                    briefing papers, suggested talking points etc., to represent him in chairing
                    regular and ad hoc meetings, to help coordinate and resolve pending issues
                    within the alliance and to carry out a variety of critical operational
                    functions, i.e. the alliance's public relations, the coordination of NATO's
                    military and nuclear planning, NATO security, as well as the administration of
                    this whole large enterprise. The organization has, of course, undergone several
                    major changes since my time, so that some of the things I will be describing may
                    no longer be the same.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, so how did it look then from your vantage
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The Political Division in my time had three parts, the Political and
                    Economic Directorates and a large Public Affairs Office headed by a German
                    diplomat. Although I was nominally the across-the board DASG, my boss, ASG Fredo
                    Dannenbring was particularly interested in Public Affairs, since he and his
                    German colleague had a close relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what did you actually do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: My political and economic staffs and I provided Lord Carrington, the
                    Secretary General and his Deputy, with constant flows of briefing papers,
                    talking points or recommendations on all the major issues before NATO to help
                    him deal with all these complexities in chairing NATO Councils, making public
                    statements, receiving high-level visitors, visiting NATO countries, etc..</p>
                <p>To do all this my Political and Economic Divisions had six and five officers
                    respectively, all seconded by NATO's member countries; a large enough staff in
                    theory, but of very uneven quality, as is often the case in international
                    organizations where some unqualified people get plum jobs because of their
                    connections.</p>
                <pb facs="0338" n="Page0338"/>
                <p>By far the best was my British political staffer, David Miller, a modest man of
                    great ability, who could turn out polished memoranda on complex subjects at
                    amazing speed. Also excellent was my French economist Jean-Claude Renaud, and
                    the invariably reliable and good-natured German diplomat Guenther Seibert, There
                    were others who were much less effective and some downright disastrous, like my
                    otherwise charming Turkish friend who shall remain nameless, who spent his time
                    smoking and looking at girlie magazines and produced virtually nothing. There
                    were two even more serious staff problems, of which more later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also chaired NATO's Political Committee, no?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right, that was the other half of my brief. The DASG traditionally
                    chaired NATO's Political Committee, technically on behalf of the ASG, although
                    in my time neither Ambassador Dannenbring, nor his successor Henning Wegener
                    chose to do so. I was therefore de facto chairman, responsible for the
                    Committee's effective operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the members and at what level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Each of the then16 NATO member nations - whose delegations, actually
                    quasi-Embassies, were all housed in the NATO Headquarter building - had a
                    representative at the Political Counselor level. We met regularly twice a week
                    for two or three hours and discussed a wide range of issues, some which we'll
                    get into later.</p>
                <p>Hierarchically, the Political Committee and the higher-ranking Military Committee
                    were subsets of the NATO Council, which usually met weekly at the Ambassadorial
                    level under the Secretary General's Chairmanship, and from time to time at the
                    level of Heads of State or Foreign Ministers. The chairmen of the Political,
                    Military Committees and other NATO organizations transmitted reports and studies
                    prepared collectively through the Secretary General to the Council to indicate
                    our collective judgments on a wide range of issues. In the case of NATO's
                    Political Committee these ranged from the then rapidly evolving state of affairs
                    in the Soviet Union, to various disarmament questions, the overall economic
                    situation in the Soviet Bloc etc. The Political Committee also addressed, and
                    when possible resolved alliance differences on a range of narrower issues, some
                    of which were referred to us by the Council.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your relationship, as an American diplomat, to
                        the US Mission to NATO? Did that pose difficulties, since you could
                        obviously be accused of bias?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0339" n="Page0339"/>
                <p>JAEGER: I followed in the tradition of having a very limited relationship with
                    the US Mission, since this strengthened my credibility as an independent
                    international official. I therefore did not even read (and wasn't invited to
                    read) the American cable traffic, except when they felt that it was important
                    that I be informally shown some message or document, lest I misunderstand what
                    they were about. By contrast, other senior people in the Secretariat were
                    constantly spending time at their Missions reading traffic and being briefed.
                    This included my boss, Ambassador Dannenbring, who would often spend half his
                    mornings at the German Mission, and sometimes tried to nudge NATO papers and
                    positions in directions favored by the Germans. Even so, I think my effort to be
                    as independent as possible, was appreciated and occasionally paid real
                    dividends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have been wondering, why this DASG job, if I am right,
                        is the highest traditionally American position in the NATO Secretariat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: This dates back to the decision that an American should be NATO's Supreme
                    Allied Commander. Given the importance of this job, the US made major
                    concessions on the civilian side. Apart from an influential but otherwise junior
                    staffer in the Private Office, Marc Grossman during Lord Carrington's tenure,
                    the DASG job is therefore the highest position at NATO Headquarters which
                    Americans traditionally occupy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that weaken the American role in NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I don't think so. The real power lies with the member nations and their
                    Missions, among which the American Mission to NATO is clearly the first among
                    equals.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who headed up the US Mission at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: David Abshire, a distinguished Reagan political appointee, who had
                    founded the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and then returned to
                    it after his tour at NATO. He was thoroughly equipped for the job and had a firm
                    grasp of the full range of East-West, disarmament, as well as European and
                    alliance questions, all of which were critical to NATO at that time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stay on this theme a bit and talk about some of the
                        senior people you worked with, Dannenbring, Wegner, and, of course,
                        Carrington and his team. What were they like and how was it working with
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0340" n="Page0340"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Fredo Dannenbring, a German career diplomat who had been Minister at
                    their Embassy in Washington, was a friendly, but very careful and adaptable
                    senior bureaucrat, who was easy to work with, but hardly inspiring. He was
                    invariably polite and kind, gave me lots of scope and wrote enthusiastic
                    efficiency reports. At the same time, he stayed closer to the German Mission
                    where he kept his bureaucratic lifelines in good repair, which undoubtedly
                    helped in obtaining other international jobs after his retirement. While his
                    caution - he almost always wanted to know which way the wind was blowing before
                    making major commitments - kept him out of trouble, he also paid a price.
                    Carrington and his immediate staff, Brian Fall and Marc Grossman, saw him as a
                    bit of a fuddy-duddy and made no secret of the fact that they wished for someone
                    more energetic and courageous who would move more imaginatively on
                    organizational and substantive issues.</p>
                <p>In his successor, Henning Wegener, another German Ambassador, who arrived in
                    October 1986 they got their wish. A brilliant, fast worker, Henning had studied
                    in the United States, spoke English almost like a native, knew virtually
                    everything about everything and if not would find out, had an extraordinary
                    amount of energy and was determined to lead and push issues to solutions.</p>
                <p>At the same time he was utterly Germanic, showed his frustrations and
                    instinctively barked at people when he wanted to get things done. Being a
                    multi-tasker, one of his less agreeable habits was to read papers, talk on the
                    phone and carry on a conversation at the same time. Indeed that was the scene
                    when I first met him in his office. Juggling his phone, he said, “You can
                    start”, continuing to read and talk to someone else. I decided we had to get
                    this straight right away and told him, “Ambassador, I'm an American diplomat and
                    your Deputy. I think it would be better if we spoke after you have finished
                    reading and talking on the telephone.” He looked startled, and then said, “Hah!
                    So you have guts! I like that!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Two days later he was just moving into his office and hung up some water
                    color sketches. When I went in to talk to him about something (we had adjoining
                    offices), he said, “George, come and look at my grandfather's water colors!” I
                    looked at them, and was absolutely appalled. They were sketches of German
                    submarines unmistakably sinking American tankers in World War I. I said,
                    “Henning! These are German World War I paintings in which Americans have been
                    killed, and you put this up in your office at NATO? The American Ambassador will
                    be outraged when he comes here. Henning looked surprised and said: “Oh! Do you
                    really think he'll be thin-skinned about that? It's so long ago!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0341" n="Page0341"/>
                <p>JAEGER: The next day they were gone.</p>
                <p>Even so, after a few critical moments, we gradually built a close relationship
                    based on sincere mutual respect and together got a great deal done. Everybody in
                    the building came to respect Henning's drive and determination, but, since he
                    didn't suffer fools or routine bureaucrats gladly, he also began offending
                    people. After watching this for a while, I went in to see him one day, closed
                    the door and said: “Henning. I must tell you, as your loyal deputy, that you are
                    offending too many people and developing a reputation. How do you expect to get
                    your next German Ambassadorship if you make so many enemies in so short a time?”
                    He actually took this in good grace, looked at me and said, “Well, George, I
                    can't help being a German and I know I behave like a German. But I have an idea.
                    You sit next to me at these meetings, and when you think I am about to
                    misbehave, kick me under the table and I will shut up.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: This Wegener-Jaeger coordinating system produced a distinct improvement,
                    although I think his shins showed a certain amount of wear and tear as a result
                    of our relationship!</p>
                <p>Even so, we parted friends, to the extent that, when I was Diplomat-in-Residence
                    at Middlebury College in my next assignment, I invited him to give a lecture. He
                    produced one of his characteristically brilliant ad lib performances to a packed
                    house of faculty and students, awed by his spectacular understanding of
                    East-West affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am sorry I missed that. How about Carrington, what was
                        he like to work for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: He was an absolutely delightful, brilliant but somewhat short tempered
                    man, full of energy and enormous wit, a quintessential representative of the
                    British upper class, who conveyed the sense that running the world was a very
                    normal thing for a fellow like him to do. Although he had had to resign as
                    Foreign Secretary over the Falklands war, he was quite unbowed and vigorously,
                    often impatiently led the NATO alliances through its many challenges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The old imperial tradition. What was he like to work
                        for?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0342" n="Page0342"/>
                <p>JAEGER: He set very high standards, was appreciative of good work but loved
                    upstaging us. We were continually preparing memos or lengthy briefing books,
                    sometimes covering fifteen or twenty major fast-moving issues for any one NATO
                    meeting or trip, often with very short lead times. Normally, when he was pleased
                    we would get little notes back thanking us. But there were exceptions. I
                    particularly remember one 'briefing book meeting' in his office which he opened,
                    with his briefing book firmly closed, saying, “Actually, I've just talked to
                    Helmut Schmidt about this and he tells me so and so. Have you heard?”, a
                    somewhat rhetorical question since none of us could call up Helmut Schmidt and
                    ask him what he thought about something. In short, he was very well informed and
                    constantly kept in touch with all the major players.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was playing the game at all levels....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: .. and letting us know it. Even so, he knew he had to be prepared for a
                    constant stream of demanding events and relied on us to do the staff work in
                    coordinating alliance views and providing the huge stream of paper necessary to
                    keep him prepared and on track.</p>
                <p>In this connection either the ASG or I would often attend his morning meetings,
                    where he and his staff rapidly went over upcoming issues and events. He insisted
                    on absolute confidentiality, although I always wondered how secure a setting he
                    was working in, for all the superb 'Victoria and Albert' paintings on loan from
                    the Museum on his walls. NATO Headquarters with sixteen in-house Missions was a
                    porous place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said the Secretary General had a staff of his
                        own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: He had an absolutely first-rate, senior officer, Brian Fall seconded from
                    the Foreign Office, who was the Director of the Private Office. Brian was
                    Carrington's most immediate advisor, his eyes and ears, speechwriter and for
                    practical purposes the supervisor of the international staff, although
                    Carrington kept a close eye on it and made final staff and management decisions
                    himself.</p>
                <p>Urbane, fashionable, amusing and invariably poised, Brian was, at the same time,
                    extraordinarily productive. To cite just one example, he awed me one evening
                    when he produced a flawless ten-page speech for Carrington on two hours notice.
                    He was, of course, on top of NATO's multiplicity of issues and often surprised
                    me with the extent to which he followed them in detail. It was probably this
                    ability to match wits with all comers and to keep NATO's many tigers sitting on
                    their stools which made him less than popular, Ambassadors and other senior
                    potentates often being thin-skinned creatures. Even so, he succeeded brilliantly
                    in his first priority of serving Carrington effectively.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0343" n="Page0343"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have any trouble with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Because of his barely concealed impatience with Fredo Dannenbring, he, at
                    one point, tried to reorganize the Political Division which would have put it in
                    effect under his direct control. We had a bit of a tussle over this, since I did
                    not think this would work in the longer run. There was also some fuss over his
                    initiative to have Murray Feshbach, the famous Georgetown Soviet and Russian
                    health expert, appointed as Carrington's own Sovietologist-in-Residence. This
                    caused some organizational confusion since the members of the Political
                    Committee, which he attended, took their direction on these issues from their
                    governments. Eventually, however, we worked it out, particularly after Wegener
                    became ASG and robustly represented our interests. As I expected, Brian, now Sir
                    Brian Fall, has gone on to a brilliant career, first as British High
                    Commissioner in Canada and then as British Ambassador in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned a second more junior officer in the Private
                        Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, Marc Grossman, then a mid-level American Foreign Service officer,
                    who later became Director General of the Foreign Service, and Deputy Under
                    Secretary for Political Affairs in the Bush II administration. He was bright,
                    flexible, manipulative and highly effective and, I thought, amused Carrington,
                    because, as a personality, he was everything Carrington was not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sometimes have a chance to work directly with
                        Carrington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Occasionally, when either Dannenbring or Wegener were unavailable, I
                    would be asked to sit to the left of Carrington at NATO Councils, in the seat
                    traditionally assigned to the ASG for Political Affairs. The idea was to be
                    available if the Secretary General needed information, advice or some document.
                    Although sometimes very important, these meetings were often less sexy than one
                    might imagine, with Ambassadors “rabbiting on” endlessly, as Carrington would
                    say, while he would be solemnly writing notes. As often as not, he would
                    actually be composing limericks, which he would then pass to the ASGs to his
                    right and left, making it look to the mystified Ambassadors as if he were
                    soliciting comments on some critical question. While the “Ambos”, as he called
                    them, were trying not to watch too intently, one could, if one had the courage,
                    write a counter limerick and pass it back to him, something along the lines
                    “There was an Ambo from Greece, whose speeches would never cease, ...”</p>

                <p>I particularly remember one occasion when I was sitting next to him at a Council
                    and the Greek Ambassador was again droning on about the latest Greek-Turkish
                    incident, which we all knew about in detail. Carrington, who was a very kind and
                    generous man, handed me a little note, which simply said, “George, I have just
                    been thinking. It must be absolutely awful to have had to start at the bottom
                    like you. I started as a Minister.”</p>

                <p>JAEGER: I think I wrote back something less than brilliant like, “I am afraid
                    that's right.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter. What was he like when things when wrong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Carrington was almost invariably controlled and courteous, but could be
                    sharp and demanding, and even loose his temper under pressure. I particularly
                    remember a press conference at which he was to comment on a Ministerial Council
                    Communiqu�, I think it was the Brussels Communiqu� of December 1986. Because of
                    some glitch, copies of the communiqu� were not ready for distribution when
                    Carrington appeared on the podium before a hundred or so journalists. When he
                    realized that he was commenting on a text no one had seen or read, he had what
                    these days might be called a public meltdown. He ended on the note that this
                    would never happen again, which it didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like the sort of thing Henry would do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Not really, because it happened rarely, and then only when he felt
                    seriously let down. Carrington, unlike some very senior people I have met, was a
                    genuinely big man. He understood the world at the highest levels, understood how
                    to handle his peers and himself, knew what he wanted and was, at the same time,
                    generous, thoughtful and kind. He helped me several times in difficult
                    situations, which he could have delegated to his Deputy or staff, after we had
                    discussed them in private. He and Lady Carrington frequently included Pat and
                    myself and others on the international staff at elegant lunches at their
                    residence and were invariably warm and gracious. To put it simply, it was an
                    honor to serve under him.</p>
                <p>b. The issues we worked on</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know its hard to summarize the political work of the
                        alliance over several years, but give us a sense of the issues you all were
                        working on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0345" n="Page0345"/>
                <p>JAEGER: I think one could break this down into two parts, the many wide-ranging
                    short-term projects I became involved in and the underlying issue, which the
                    Political Committee and ultimately the whole alliance, worked on during this
                    entire period, to whit: What was Gorbachev all about? Was he for real? And what
                    did all this mean for NATO and the West?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start with a sampling of the more specific projects,
                        OK?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: To give a sense of the variety and range, when I arrived the NATO
                    nations' positions on the CDE's (Conference on Disarmament in Europe) efforts to
                    agree to Europe-wide confidence-building measures, were all over the place and
                    badly bogged down in a Committee. I won't go into all the technical details and
                    differences involved, but one of the first things I was asked to do was to try
                    to get these differences resolved so that the NATO Council could send an agreed
                    NATO guidance to the NATO reps who were urgently waiting for this in Stockholm.
                    I am glad to say that after a few weeks of energetic work we succeeded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you actually do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Obviously international staff can't change national positions. I could,
                    however, impart a sense of urgency, convene frequent meetings, reiterate
                    Carrington's wish that we get this done pronto, and occasionally, when we had
                    reached an impasse, suggest and, in side conversations with delegations, sell
                    compromise language. It was invariably an untidy but necessary process.</p>
                <p>I was soon in a similar position at NATO's Lisbon Ministerial in June 1985 when,
                    in Dannenbring's unexpected absence, I found myself chairing the alliance's
                    communiqu� drafting committee, where after some tough bargaining, particularly
                    on the paragraphs concerning INF deployment (Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces),
                    from which Greece and Denmark abstained, agreement was hammered out. I always
                    found it puzzling, particularly after negotiating texts like these, that the
                    media were rarely inquisitive enough to find out where the fault lines had been
                    and who, in the end, had yielded to whom.</p>
                <p>The Brussels Ministerial in December 1986 involved another tense and difficult
                    Communiqu� negotiation, particularly with the French, at which I assisted the
                    ASG and then took over for the final hours, when he was called away, and helped
                    hammer out the agreement.</p>
                <pb facs="0346" n="Page0346"/>
                <p>In retrospect, these communiqu� drafting and major negotiating exercises were
                    perhaps the most exciting part of this assignment. Meetings often started at 10
                    in the morning in the pious hope that agreement would be reached quickly. When
                    by eight o'clock in the evening only partial progress had been made over minor
                    differences, usually between the French on the one side and the British and the
                    Americans on the other, and the rest splitting in various ways between, one
                    might well ask what the ASG or I could do to bring the parties together.</p>
                <p>Well, we had some important weapons. One was time itself. They all knew that
                    sooner or later, they would have to agree to a text since failure to do so could
                    not be concealed, and would be perceived as a crisis in the alliance. Many
                    delegations, therefore, actually hoped that, at the critical point, which
                    usually happened very late at night when people were exhausted and tempers
                    frayed, we would suggest alternative language which could bridge the differences
                    and become the basis for agreement. The test for us was whether we had sensed
                    the limits of the conflicting positions carefully enough to be able to draft
                    just the right few sentences which would produce consensus. It was tricky, and
                    exciting, even though the end product, to the outsider, invariably sounded
                    bland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a time when a whole gamut of east-west arms
                        control negotiations were in play, and we had countered the Soviet SS-20
                        intermediate threat to Europe with our Pershings. How was this all dealt
                        with in the Political Committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Incrementally, because, and this is important to stress, neither we nor
                    the governments involved had the benefit of hindsight. So the process, by
                    definition, was not like an academic seminar, but a constant groping, based on
                    fragmentary information and developments, of trying to correctly understand.</p>
                <p>One of Carrington's constant interests, in this connection, was to get people
                    thinking and not to let the humdrum routine of big organization set the pace.
                    So, besides our bi-weekly general discussions, in which delegations brought up
                    and commented on current developments, I constantly pushed for and often got
                    agreement to collectively prepare what turned out to be a longish series of
                    papers; for example on the state and prospects for CSCE, on successive
                    developments in the Warsaw Pact, which was showing strain, on the then on-going
                    UN discussion on non-use of force and, again and again, on various aspects of
                    the great changes which seemed to be underway in Moscow and their implications
                    for the ongoing arms control talks, like MBFR, INF, etc.</p>
                <p>The limiting factor, of course was, that this was not a free-wheeling discussion
                    of intellectuals. Rather, each of the Political Committee's members spoke on
                    instruction from his government, reported back what others had said and then, at
                    the next meeting, hopefully took the process a step further.</p>
                <pb facs="0347" n="Page0347"/>
                <p>So writing even fairly short substantive papers really meant coordinating the
                    resources and views of sixteen governments, to the extent they were willing to
                    share - a sometimes a tedious, frustrating process. I tried hard to stimulate
                    the discussions, but was sometimes curtly reminded by my French representative,
                    that the role of the Secretariat was to facilitate, not to express views or
                    positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the quality of the reps on the Political
                        committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, it ranged from the outstanding to the mediocre and, in one case,
                    the almost hopeless. Another limiting factor which may surprise you, is that
                    governments did not always share their own best intelligence and analyses but
                    often contributed bland and uninspired national drafts, which I then had to
                    craft into a, hopefully, more incisive composite text. This was then circulated,
                    commented on further tweaked and, sometimes after a whole series of meetings,
                    finally approved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why didn't NATO always get member countries' best
                        political analyses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I suspect because some Foreign offices were afraid of leaks and no one
                    really wanted NATO's Political Committee, or even the NATO Council to become the
                    intellectual nerve center of the alliance. Even so, Lord Carrington and many
                    others again and again expressed their appreciation, privately and at the NATO
                    Council, of the quality of work we were able to produce.</p>
                <p>c. Is Gorby for real?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The central question through this whole period, as you
                        said, was the significance of what was happening in the Soviet Union and
                        among its Eastern European satellites. Did the Political Committee or anyone
                        in the NATO alliance get it right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The issue came to the fore as soon as Gorbachev succeeded Chernenko, the
                    last of the USSR's petrified dictators, in March 1985. Almost from the outset he
                    launched tantalizing but fragmentary reforms. He began with vague proposals for
                    economic reform, which became more programmatic as his efforts intensified to
                    overcome the stagnation of the Brezhnev era; as well as startlingly new concepts
                    like 'glasnost' and 'perestroika'. He bravely tackled the USSR's massive alcohol
                    problem, with economically calamitous results and, to everyone's surprise,
                    replaced Gromyko, who had been a nay-saying fixture on the world scene for
                    twenty eight years, with the diplomatically inexperienced but more open minded
                    Shevardnadze.</p>
                <pb facs="0348" n="Page0348"/>
                <p>By February '86, glasnost' and 'perestroika' were, as you know, among the various
                    reform ideas legitimized by the 27th Party Congress. The real bomb shell was the
                    Chernobyl disaster, during which the Soviet hard-liners had blocked the flow of
                    accurate information, which would have been so useful to minimize the health
                    risks for the millions in eastern and western Europe who were likely to be
                    affected by its radio-active cloud. Gorbachev publicly demanded 'glasnost' and
                    so gave further credibility to his efforts at reform. By December of '86 , in
                    another symbolically highly significant event, Andrei Sakharov was invited back
                    to Moscow from his exile somewhere in Siberia. And by January '87 Gorbachev's
                    program of major political reforms was adopted by a Central Committee plenum,
                    including startling proposals like multi-candidate elections and the appointment
                    of non-party members to government jobs.</p>
                <p>At the same time the tension between Gorbachev and the old Stalinist hardliners,
                    as well as with Boris Yeltsin, increased visibly, while Gorbachev rehabilitated
                    some anti-Stalinists. It was not till November, a few months after I had left
                    NATO, that he published his pathbreaking book 'Perestroika: New Thinking for Our
                    Country and the World' which in a way put it all together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a fair summary of some of the key events on the
                        domestic side. Can you also sketch out the foreign policy sequence to help
                        set the other side of the stage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The first thing everyone noticed was the change of style. Instead of the
                    often bellicose negativity of previous Soviet rulers, Gorbachev tried to reduce
                    tensions and improve relations with the West and managed to form good personal
                    relationships with people like the Margaret Thatcher, Helmut Kohl and even
                    President Reagan. He took a major concrete step toward detente in April '86 when
                    he suspended SS-20 deployment, (the massive mobile intermediate range missile
                    deployment begun in the late '70's) to begin to resolve the intermediate-range
                    nuclear weapons (INF) issues; and some months later proposed that both the US
                    and USSR cut their nuclear armaments in half. He made his first trip abroad to
                    France in October and then met President Reagan at the Geneva Summit in
                    November. In January '87 he again astonished the international community when he
                    proposed the complete elimination of INF systems in Europe and of all nuclear
                    weapons by 2000. This led to the surprise agreement in principle at the
                    Reykjavik summit with President Reagan in October to remove INF systems from
                    Europe and to eliminate all nuclear weapons by 1996! Quick agreement foundered
                    on Reagan's insistence on Star Wars (SDI), but the INF Treaty, with the most
                    comprehensive verification and on-sight inspection system, was signed in the
                    fall of '87.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was the background. How did you all interpret
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0349" n="Page0349"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Looking at it in hindsight, when we know how the story actually came out,
                    we missed by a mile. No one, neither governments nor any of the experts foresaw
                    that Gorbachev would bring about the imminent demise and disintegration of the
                    Soviet Union. The key would have been to ask whether, when push came to shove,
                    Gorbachev would use force to preserve the Soviet system. since without coercion
                    the unity of the Warsaw Pact and of the various components of the Soviet Union
                    would simply and abruptly evaporate.</p>
                <p>But that was not obvious or foreseeable as the Gorbachev story and its attended
                    events in the satellites unfolded in a long series of discrete events. So, when
                    you visualize the reps of NATO's sixteen governments sitting around a table
                    twice a week, you have to take into account that they were trying to digest and
                    integrate successive developments as they were occurring and could not foresee
                    with any confidence how it was all going to play out. What's more, perceptions
                    were complicated by the fact that Stalinist resistance to Gorbachev was not
                    extinct and that Soviet negotiators in various fora were still putting forward
                    positions which were a mixture of forward looking and traditional hardline
                    Soviet positions, particularly their initial foot dragging on serious
                    verification ....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which could to some extent reflect the three way political
                        divisions in Moscow between Gorbachev, the hardliners and the radical,
                        impatient reformers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. Moreover, one has to emphasize that at the time, and even
                    today perhaps, we were not really sure as to the extent to which these were
                    divisions between Gorbachev and others, or reflected conflicts within
                    Gorbachev's own mind...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...that debate is still going on among Sovietologists as
                        to the real answer to just these problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: So, conventional opinion, that we were all stupid not to foresee the
                    collapse of the USSR overlooks the context in which we were all working.</p>
                <p>What's more military intelligence throughout much of this time was reporting
                    continuing expansion of some Soviet military programs which complicated
                    analysis. In retrospect these, of course, turned out to be the death rattles of
                    the Soviet system, but at the time nobody could be quite sure. What's more, the
                    SDI initiative, Reagan's Star Wars, complicated the picture, since the Soviets
                    saw American missile defense then, as now, as a threat to their deterrent
                    capabilities. Although that scuttled the idea of nuclear disarmament at
                    Reykjavik, it had little bearing on the basic question, “Is Gorbachev for
                    real?”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0350" n="Page0350"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paradoxically it may have been President Reagan who first
                        came to the conclusion that Gorbachev was for real, well before his
                        immediate advisors and the foreign policy establishment were ready to accept
                        that fact.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I think that's possible, and culminated in the extraordinary events at
                    Reykjavik, where he was willing to go to the point of offering to agree to
                    abolish all nuclear weapons, which sent the military of the entire alliance into
                    total shock and was then promptly reversed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Reversed only because Gorbachev insisted on the U.S.
                        giving up the SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative) project, and Reagan packed
                        up his briefcase and walked out of the meeting room at that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: To sum this, up, the Political Committee carefully followed and endlessly
                    discussed the many twists and turns of the Gorbachev saga during these years.
                    Draft conclusions were vigorously discussed, sent back to capitals, then
                    rediscussed, a time consuming and emotionally wearing process of trying to
                    integrate various governments' nuanced positions on these ongoing developments
                    in the USSR without depriving our conclusions of all consistency.</p>
                <p>As a result our reports were sometimes almost overtaken by the time we were able
                    to reach agreement and send a text to the NATO Council. They were also often
                    rather watered down, although, from time to time, we were able to produce texts
                    that were received with appreciation by the NATO community. Even so, by the
                    summer of '87 when I left, we had not wrung our way through to a clear
                    appreciation of Gorbachev's historic significance and no one foresaw or was
                    willing to predict that the Soviet Union was about to fall apart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, no one knew that, not even the Soviets! Getting back
                        to the main issue, how did your thinking stack up against the popular
                        argument that Ronald Reagan won the cold war simply by outspending the
                        Russians on hardware and arms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I think that greatly oversimplifies the fact in the end, as Kennan had
                    expected, it was forty long years of containment, against which Moscow pushed
                    and struggled, which eventually exhausted them, overstretched their system and
                    led to their collapse.</p>
                <pb facs="0351" n="Page0351"/>
                <p>The immediate cause of this denouement was their massive deployment of SS-20s,
                    beginning in the late '70s, whose 1200 independently targetable nuclear warheads
                    were meant to neutralize our ability to offset the USSR's massive conventional
                    advantage in Europe by targeting our nuclear deterrent systems in Europe. The
                    idea was to weaken European confidence in American reliability as strategic
                    partners by raising the question in the European minds whether in a crisis we
                    would really use our strategic nuclear missiles and bombers to defend Europe and
                    so put America at risk. So the ultimate aim of the huge SS-20 deployment was to
                    'decouple' Europe politically and psychologically from the United States.</p>
                <p>We regained the psychological advantage and won this great confrontation by
                    persuading European parliaments, in the face of massive, ultimately in large
                    part Communist-triggered demonstrations to permit American counter-deployments
                    of Pershings and Tomahawks. As Gromyko is reported to have said, “the SS-20 was
                    our last card.” His debilitated and weary Soviet system had been stretched to
                    the limit. They had no more resources left for another try. In retrospect it was
                    the collapse of their SS-20 campaign, which in the end enabled Gorbachev to
                    preach detente, as the only remaining viable alternative.</p>
                <p>So rather than giving all the credit to President Reagan's big military budgets,
                    important as they may have been, the real credit goes to George Kennan, all
                    those who built the alliance system which contained the USSR and those who
                    followed them.</p>
                <p>d. Reaction to the Reykjavik summit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction at NATO headquarters after the
                        Reykjavik summit in the fall of '86 where there was almost an agreement on
                        nuclear disarmament?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I think Carrington's opening statement to the December Ministerial
                    Council, which I had drafted, summarizes the range of reactions at the time. “I
                    suspect you will be concerned,” he said, “about all the talk about the
                    consequences of Reykjavik, public reactions that range from initial
                    disappointment that no agreements have been signed, through excitement over the
                    business which we're all about to open up, to a somewhat cautious reaction from
                    some sectors of opinion which after years of clamoring for progress in arms
                    control appear to be frightened by the prospects now that there is a chance of
                    real hope.”</p>
                <pb facs="0352" n="Page0352"/>
                <p>Carrington then went on with his own reflections on this situation. “I think we
                    should take care not to be too negative about the developments of Reykjavik even
                    though in reality we may suspect that they would take much more time to refine,
                    develop, and negotiate. Few of us had expected anything very substantial to
                    emerge from this meeting, which after all was billed only as a summit to discuss
                    a summit. That so many elements in a possibly far reaching .... negotiating
                    package had emerged from President Reagan's conversation with General Secretary
                    Gorbachev was, I think, a quite remarkable accomplishment. For after years of
                    frustration, they opened up a broad new vision of arms control in which
                    substantial reductions of strategic nuclear systems have become a real
                    possibility.”</p>
                <p>“The vision”, Carrington continued” was only a first step. The ideas developed at
                    Reykjavik would evolve under expert study at Geneva and in allied consultations.
                    More obviously still, much would depend in the final analysis on the Soviet
                    Union's willingness to accept a degree of verification,” and this was the heart
                    of the matter, “which will be necessary to establish confidence.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That being a problem in arms control from the very
                        beginning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. Carrington then went to suggest that were the Soviets also
                    to drop linking an INF (Intermediate-range nuclear force) agreement to SDI,
                    Reagan's Star Wars project, the linkage which had led to the breakup at
                    Reykjavik, a “satisfactory INF agreement might well be negotiated...” .</p>
                <p>He even thought that it should not be “impossible to agree to a fifty percent
                    reduction in strategic arms if the necessary modalities of their implication can
                    be agreed,” a rather daring statement given the resistance the Reykjavik
                    discussion had generated in some US and allied quarters.</p>
                <p>The Ministerial communiqu� issued at the end of that meeting echoed many of these
                    points, although it made no specific reference to Star Wars which clearly was
                    not universally accepted in the alliance at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So NATO was on the whole sympathetic to drastic
                        reductions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: In principle yes, although verifiable INF, MBFR and other arms control
                    agreements were more immediate objectives. In the end, the key was the
                    achievement of enduring stability and security in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0353" n="Page0353"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the media react to major statements like that and
                        to NATO communiqu�s? Was there sophisticated coverage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Neither the media nor the public was aware of the intensity of the
                    negotiations which often went into the hammering out of communiqu� texts.
                    Opinions ranged from the French who were generally closest to the Russian side,
                    to the Scandinavians, particularly the Danes, who wanted to see and hear no evil
                    and usually pushed for conciliatory language, to the more sturdy allies, like
                    the UK and Germany, who were more attuned to the strategic realities and tended
                    more often to be on the US side; although as particular issues arose in many of
                    these very complicated negotiations each nation, particularly Germany, which was
                    on the front lines, reacted in accordance with how they thought they would be
                    affected.</p>
                <p>Delegations also split in other ways, for instance when anything Mediterranean
                    was involved, you could expect the French, Spanish, Portuguese and Italians to
                    work as a bloc. Turkey, whose military made a huge contribution on the southern
                    flank, was usually helpful, except of course when Greece and Cyprus were
                    concerned. It was a complex scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the media seem to understand these differences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Rarely. It was always a source of puzzlement to me how consistently the
                    mobs of reporters who turned up at Ministerial Communiqu� press conferences
                    missed the issues which had involved the most difficult intra-NATO negotiations.
                    Communiqu�s by definition make dull reading. The first reaction usually was,
                    “Well, there's nothing new in this,” when, in fact, there always was something
                    new, particularly if you understood the issues and had followed them over
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question on this theme. Was George Shultz at this
                        or other Ministerials you attended? What was he like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, several times. He was somebody I respected and admired greatly, a
                    person of great directness, great honesty, who understood the importance of
                    words, did not use them lightly, and who, throughout, had the respect of his
                    professional partners in the diplomatic world.</p>
                <p>At the Brussels Foreign Ministers meeting we just discussed he arrived visibly
                    exhausted after an overnight flight. The Council was debating one of the major
                    arms control issues, and, while Shultz was dozing off, Foreign Ministers were
                    giving lengthy speeches suggesting lack of unanimity. When Carrington thought
                    they had talked enough he turned to the Secretary of State and said: “Well
                    George, what do you think?” Shultz bolted upright and with a strong voice simply
                    said: “The United States of America is for this text.” And that was the end of
                    that, and they all fell in line.</p>
                <pb facs="0354" n="Page0354"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Shultz was by profession a labor negotiator. It's a
                        form of diplomacy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It certainly showed.</p>
                <p>e. The French at NATO</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have talked about the French several times. De Gaulle
                        had pulled them out of the military aspects of the Alliance but they
                        remained on the NATO Council and continued to participate on the political
                        side of the Alliance. How did they behave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: My years in Paris had not really prepared me for the frequent
                    intractability and occasionally shocking rudeness of the French at NATO. The
                    issue went far beyond their insistence that everything written and spoken had to
                    be simultaneously available in French, an, in principle, reasonable demand; even
                    though it would, at times, paralyze my Political Committee, when for some reason
                    the French version of a text was temporarily unavailable - even though the
                    personally very cultivated and polite French representative spoke almost perfect
                    English. I gradually came to understand, that, the core objective of French
                    policy was to assure that France be taken seriously as a major player, that they
                    would not be perceived to buckle under Anglo-American pressure and really saw
                    American influence at NATO as the obstacle to their assuming their rightful
                    place as 'chairman' of the European world.</p>
                <p>So this battle for French influence was carried on constantly, daily at many
                    levels, although it was, in the first instance, a language question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask you whether French and English were the
                        languages in all NATO proceedings and how this actually worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0355" n="Page0355"/>
                <p>JAEGER: All documents were issued in French and English. At Council and other
                    meetings there was simultaneous translation, so that the French did not have to
                    hear English and the English did not have to hear French. You have to visualize
                    the NATO translation staff, inundated and sometimes overwhelmed by endless
                    papers, doing its best to issue them on time in both languages. Inevitably there
                    were mistakes, slip-ups and delays. So , if a Political Committee text was not
                    issued simultaneously in French and English, or if there were French mistakes,
                    or if something had been left out of the French version and didn't precisely
                    match the English version, you could count on the French delegate spending ten
                    minutes or more complaining how the French are again being discriminated against
                    and, in more serious cases, threatening bureaucratic reprisals at higher levels.
                    Needless to say there was also intense haggling and negotiation on the precise
                    translation of certain phrases which were important substantively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was all this reflected on the substantive level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Substantively, French policy usually hewed a shade closer to Moscow than
                    the rest, which Paris thought improved their leverage on both sides. The
                    practical effect was that the French would often work to water down positions
                    which they considered too harsh on the Soviet Union and its allies, sometimes
                    with tough tactics in the political Committee and the Council. There was a
                    degree of bitterness in the French delegation's attitude and behavior...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this tactical or genuine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Probably a mixture, but bitterness bordering on hostility nevertheless,
                    which drove them to be competitive and difficult, particularly with the
                    Americans. You get this determination that France must, at some point, get on
                    top again, and that the Americans and their European partners were the
                    obstacle.</p>
                <p>All that said they never drove things to a critical rupture, although there were
                    some very tough and nasty moments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any of these people whom you had known in Paris in
                        the mid '70s?</hi>

                <p>JAEGER: It's interesting you should ask that. One of the young stars on the Quai
                    d'Orsay's Policy Staff in Paris at that time, who had been one of Warren
                    Zimmermann's interlocutors, was Benoit d'Aboville; a brilliant, powerful,
                    enormously energetic young officer, a sort of junior Henry VIII type, clearly
                    destined to become a star. By the mid-eighties d'Aboville had risen like a
                    rocket and become the Quai's Deputy Undersecretary for Political Affairs, and so
                    the boss of the French NATO delegation, among others. In that capacity he would
                    show up at NATO Council meetings, and even at Communiqu� negotiating sessions,
                    when issues of special importance to Paris were in play.</p>
                <p>His tactic, when faced with NATO majorities, as he usually was, was to become
                    harsher and harsher, to the point of throwing absolutely inexcusable tantrums. I
                    particularly remember one Council meeting, when d'Aboville strode into the room
                    halfway through the meeting, got the French Ambassador out of his chair with a
                    gesture which implied, “if you were doing your job I wouldn't have to come down
                    here to do it for you,” and berated the Council in angry and impolite terms.
                    When he failed to move anyone, D'Aboville, stormed out, slammed the door behind
                    him, and left all of us, including Lord Carrington, shocked and open-mouthed at
                    this inexcusable behavior.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rather strange allies!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, he made enemies, and never made it to the top of French diplomacy.
                    We met again in 1990 when he was French Consul General in New York - a plush but
                    certainly not a very influential position - where he received me with open arms.
                    We had a drink together and joked about the vigorous old days at NATO. Now all
                    he was seeing was New York millionaires who liked to drink French wine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the French position at NATO draw any sympathy for
                        other NATO members?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, depending on the issue. The Spanish and Italian delegations often
                    supported them, although they were sometimes ready to compromise after making
                    their obeisance to Paris as a result of allied pressures applied elsewhere. You
                    have to keep in mind that exchanges on the whole range of alliance issues were
                    not only going on at NATO but also bilaterally across Europe and with us in
                    Washington. So that, for example, an issue, blocked by whoever, might also be
                    discussed bilaterally in Bonn and the Germans might then ask their people in
                    relevant NATO countries to further push for compromise. When you visualize that
                    this sort of thing was going on continually across the whole range of major and
                    sometimes minor Embassies, you get a sense of the complexity and scope of
                    alliance discussions, which ultimately reduced themselves to concrete
                    decisions.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give me an example of how this might work, let's
                        say, if one were the Political Counselor at the American NATO Mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, one would attend meetings and talk to people in the corridors and
                    over lunch, until one had a pretty good fix on where the various countries stood
                    on some particular issue, how much flexibility there was by whom and on what
                    terms. One would then write a telegram to Washington, copied to all our
                    Embassies in NATO countries....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ....and they would then comment on that from their
                        perspective...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Precisely. Depending on the question, still other Embassies, like Moscow,
                    Geneva or Tokyo might be copied and contribute. As a result all our people in
                    our major embassies would be as 'au courant' of almost everything that occurred
                    at NATO as we were and be part of the discussion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Lord Carrington sometimes discuss specially sensitive
                        matters with individual Ambassadors or more restricted groups than the NATO
                        Council?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Frequently, since the Secretary General can't really serve as an
                    intermediary or negotiator or discuss certain particularly sensitive or
                    neuralgic issues when he is on the record as the impartial Chairman in the NATO
                    Council.</p>
                <p>f. The Greeks and Turks</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that the ongoing quarrels of the Greeks and
                        Turks, both NATO allies, would be one such subject requiring frequent
                        handholding and intervention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Exactly. That was even true for me as Chairman of the Political
                    Committee. You would think that Gorbachev and disarmament would have taken up
                    the majority of my time and effort. Not so. The most time consuming and
                    frustrating issue continually plaguing us during these years was the
                    Greek-Turkish conflict, which had crystallized over Cyprus but found practical
                    expression in constant recriminations in our Committee and at the NATO Council
                    over alleged air space or naval violations by one side or the other, or all
                    sorts of other slights, real or imagined.</p>
                <pb facs="0358" n="Page0358"/>
                <p>Obviously this took up a great deal of Committee and Council time, since protests
                    were constantly registered by one side or the other, then rebutted at length,
                    leading to long, emotional exchanges. Our main interest was that this bilateral
                    bickering not become so ferocious as to sour the whole atmosphere or interfere
                    with the main business of the alliance. So we would try to get the Greeks and
                    the Turks to come in and register their grievances to us in private, rather than
                    carrying on endlessly in the official NATO bodies.</p>
                <p>To an extent that worked, although not without cost. I still remember the many,
                    exhausting meetings with our passionate and inflexible Greek representative,
                    followed by the resigned, sad looking Turk, each delivering or reinforcing
                    protests and telling me diametrically different tales about the latest outrage
                    committed by one side or the other. Even though we tried to provide sounding
                    boards and to conciliate, the issue still bubbled up constantly in the NATO
                    Council, and sometimes even at the Ministerial level, when NATO's Foreign
                    Ministers convened.</p>
                <p>Often, when the back and forth over some alleged incident went on too long,
                    Carrington would call in the Greek and Turkish Ambassadors successively and ever
                    so diplomatically suggest that they had made their points, and that NATO had to
                    get on with its agenda. Even this didn't always work, since, when things got to
                    a real boil, there were passionate long speeches in Council by the Greek
                    Ambassador, and the otherwise kind and wise Turkish Ambassador would rise to
                    remind the alliance that they were providing sixty divisions on the USSR's
                    southern flank, and on one occasion, that there were Turkic speaking people all
                    across Western and Central Asia who would someday make us all sorry that we were
                    not taking the Turks and their concerns more seriously.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Kurdish and Armenian questions come up in your
                        dealings with the Turks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: While these are important, they are not directly relevant to NATO's work
                    and would just have added to the list of combustible inter-allied issues.
                    Obviously everyone was aware of them as part of the background.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, to your first question, in Lisbon in '85 and in Halifax in May '86.
                    At the Halifax Ministerial I was asked to be in charge of the advance team which
                    makes sure that all the arrangements are in place.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0359" n="Page0359"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: We got there a few days before the meeting, checked into a huge barn of a
                    hotel right on the harbor (now demolished), which had great views and lots of
                    atmosphere and went about our preparations. All went well, until one of the NATO
                    security people came to me and said, “Did you know that there is a Soviet
                    merchant ship docked within a few hundred feet from this hotel, with quite a few
                    antennas.” I had somehow overlooked the dreary-looking, rusting hull, but now
                    realized that it was indeed sprouting a remarkable number of antennas. So I
                    phoned the Operations Center at the State Department, was patched through to the
                    Pentagon's expert on Soviet intelligence ships and, bingo, had confirmation that
                    our neighbor was a very powerful and well known member of that fraternity,
                    clearly sent specially to Halifax to record our meeting. I was assured that they
                    would easily be able to listen in to everything within, I think I remember, a
                    half mile distance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that was exciting and a challenge!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Oh yes! The question then was what to do. I first tried to get the
                    Canadians to move the ship, to have the harbor master tell them to anchor 10
                    miles down the river or wherever. To my amazement the Canadians did not want to
                    risk an incident, and worried over the possibility that they might have to use
                    force if the Russians refused to move, which they were not prepared to do.</p>
                <p>So I got word to George Shultz, who was underway to Halifax, outlined the
                    situation and suggested that we only had two options, pressure the Canadians to
                    move the ship or move the NATO Ministerial, unless we wanted to give a verbatim
                    record of all the proceedings to the Russians on a silver platter. He chose the
                    second option, and we moved the Ministerial on something like six hours notice
                    to Government House, a safe distance away. I always wondered what the KGB folks
                    on the ship thought when they realized they had made the trip to Canada for
                    nothing.</p>
                <p>h. NATO at war: Winter exercises</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We haven't yet discussed the military and their role at
                        NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The operational command, as you know, was and still is in Mons, some way
                    outside of Brussels, the headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander (SACEUR),
                    by tradition always an American four star general. Overall military policy
                    questions are decided in NATO's Military Committee, chaired by a three star,
                    whose members are normally two star officers. The Military Committee, like the
                    Political Committee reports to the NATO Council and so is part of the Secretary
                    General's domain.</p>
                <pb facs="0360" n="Page0360"/>
                <p>Although the Political and Military Committees had a liaison mechanism our work
                    tended to be discrete. I was occasionally invited to Mons for briefings and had
                    good personal relations with a number of key people on the military side,
                    notably Admiral Jonathan Howe, the Deputy Chairman of the Military Committee,
                    later Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe and Deputy Assistant to President
                    George HW Bush for National Security Affairs; as well as with my old friend from
                    Quebec, General Francois Richard, the Canadian Military Representative at NATO,
                    who, a soldiers' soldier, found the high-level bureaucracy trying, in spite of
                    all the perks.</p>
                <p>The most gripping military exposure came in the annual Top Secret WINTEX
                    exercises, an annual NATO wide war game, played as a paper exercise at NATO
                    headquarters, but involving many real exercises by NATO units in the field. The
                    scenario always began with a growing number of incidents suggesting that
                    something unusual was afoot, building up to a crescendo that there was a
                    possibility of Soviet attack. It was at that point that the actual exercise
                    would start.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the players at the top level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Everyone, first meeting separately in their respective committees, then
                    jointly under Carrington's chairmanship in a specially equipped large conference
                    room where new developments were displayed on a large screen. As it became clear
                    that the Soviet armies were on the move, there were increasingly realistic
                    discussions as to how the alliance should respond, since we theoretically had
                    the whole gamut of western resources at our disposal. Real time mock decisions
                    would be made involving military movements, preparedness, civil defense etc, and
                    mock communiqu�s of increasing urgency and seriousness were drafted, agreed and
                    issued, warning the Soviets to desist or face serious, in the end nuclear
                    consequences. So over the three week period of the exercise, tension would
                    gradually rise to a climax, until, after more and more serious incidents, the
                    scenario would have Soviet armies actually cross into NATO territory.</p>
                <p>At was at this point that the alliance was , of course, faced with the issue of
                    nuclear use, since it was understood that our conventional forces were not
                    sufficient to repel them or even to hold them at the Rhine. This meant that
                    targets and the numbers and sizes of nuclear strikes had to picked, a wildly
                    eerie exercise which brought home the utter seriousness of what we were facing
                    and about to do. Even though everybody knew this was an exercise, we had all, by
                    this time, been living in this imaginary scenario for over two weeks and, in
                    this large room full of generals, admirals and diplomats, the crisis had become
                    intensely real.</p>
                <pb facs="0361" n="Page0361"/>
                <p>I had always naively assumed that the political people just give the go ahead,
                    and that the military would do the rest. Actually, it makes a huge difference
                    whether you, for example, decide on one minimal nuclear strike as a signal to
                    the other side that we are serious, or whether we go blasting off with all
                    barrels, precipitating global nuclear war.</p>
                <p>Since the point was to get the Soviets to go home, the calibration of the
                    responses at this stage were therefore crucial - what targets, how many
                    kilotons, by what delivery means and for what reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Incidentally, I assume that the French were not involved
                        in these exercises?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Besides their diplomatic representatives, the French always had a
                    military observer, a French two star general, who sat on the Military Committee.
                    So they were in effect participants whose views counted and observers at the
                    same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: So these really chilling decisions had to be made, and made very rapidly,
                    since the scenario would continue to show massive Soviet forward movement,
                    accompanied by increasingly damaging sabotage operations across West Germany and
                    elsewhere in Europe. Proposals would be made for a few low-kiloton strikes on
                    air fields and other non-civilian targets, let's say, in Hungary, East Germany,
                    Czechoslovakia and Poland, preceded by “final” warning messages to the Warsaw
                    Pact.</p>
                <p>What was riveting was that the ensuing rapid discussion did not only focus on the
                    likely military effectiveness of this response, but on member countries'
                    interest in and relations with the targeted countries. Thus the Germans would
                    press vigorously for eliminating or reducing East German targets to a minimum,
                    even though that's where the bulk of the Warsaw Pact forces were, and preferred
                    strikes elsewhere among the Soviet satellites. The French diplomats wanted to go
                    easy on the Poles, and so forth. But time pressure forced conclusions, since the
                    Generals and Lord Carrington would force a decision lest we be too late. The
                    exercise ended when, after further escalations and warnings, nuclear strikes
                    were actually 'ordered' and the scenario, rather unrealistically, concluded that
                    this had persuaded Moscow and its Allies to withdraw. It was hip hip, hurrah,
                    and NATO wins again!</p>
                <p>And so we would leave this confined world of nuclear horrors into the daylight of
                    the 'real' world, blinking at the bright lights like the prisoners in Fidelio
                    emerging from their prison, much more keenly aware of what a real showdown would
                    involve if mutual deterrence failed.</p>

                <p>One of the many unanswered questions was, whether in case of a real attack,
                    governments would actually wait for NATO to have its meetings in a flimsy
                    headquarters building susceptible to easy sabotage or attack.</p>
                <p>i. Warsaw Pact espionage and other personnel problems</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously war games like this would expose NATO's most
                        secret nuclear capabilities and plans. Were people afraid of Soviet and
                        Warsaw Pact espionage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's a fascinating question. Since a military alliance of, at the time,
                    16 nations involved thousands of people who to varying degrees were privy to
                    security matters, the issue of espionage and Soviet or Warsaw Pact penetration
                    was obviously on people's minds; although, psychologically, the normalcy of
                    headquarters life tended to dull one's instincts.</p>
                <p>NATO did have a security division under an American security expert, who
                    presumably liaised with the alliance's security and intelligence services. Since
                    he reported only to the Secretary General in private, it was hard to know how
                    effective this was and what was going on. There were rumors from time to time
                    that someone had been dismissed for security reasons, but that could have been
                    for anything from alcoholism to more serious indiscretions. Most of the time
                    they dealt with routine things like documents being left out at night, safes or
                    doors being left unlocked, risky personal behavior, this kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did people think that NATO was penetrated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That, of course, was the real question, since KGB and other Warsaw pact
                    agents had, very occasionally, been uncovered in the past. While this was the
                    continuing worry, there was an interesting counter-theory that this might
                    actually not be a bad thing. The message their spies would take back to Moscow
                    would be that, yes, NATO really was committed to using its nuclear deterrent if
                    attacked, thus reinforcing the deterrent message, but had no plans for its part
                    to attack the Warsaw Pact, as Soviet propaganda had long claimed in describing
                    NATO as an aggressive alliance.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any Warsaw pact agents uncovered during your time
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0363" n="Page0363"/>
                <p>JAEGER: No, but some years after I had left NATO I learned to my amazement that
                    Rainer Rupp, one of the people in the economic section of my Political
                    Directorate had ben arrested and tried in Germany as the Warsaw pacts arguably
                    most successful spy at NATO. I knew Rainer quite well. He was nondescript,
                    retiring, did solid, but far from brilliant work, punctually handed in all his
                    assignments, never drew attention to himself and volunteered to go on occasional
                    trips to give speeches about the alliance or to attend conferences as our
                    representative. I remember approving several of these trips, including an
                    unusual one to Tokyo. Rainer had persuaded me on the grounds that NATO officials
                    don't often get to Japan, and that it might be good thing for them to hear
                    something about NATO. What none of us knew was that all this was simply the
                    cover for his real work as a highly gifted and productive East German agent,
                    who, I heard, also directed a network of other agents at NATO, including his
                    wife who for a time worked as an assistant or a secretary for our Security
                    Chief!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they find out that he was a mole?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I don't know beyond the accounts I have found in researching this
                    recently, one of which, from Wikipedia, is excerpted as follows:</p>
                <p>" Born in East Germany, Rupp grew up in West Germany with strong leftist
                    political leanings. In 1968, as a student in Mainz, work as a spy for the GDR
                    was suggested to him, and he agreed out of conviction. He continued his studies
                    in Brussels, was trained as a spy in East Berlin and was hired by NATO in 1977.
                    He rose quickly in the ranks and provided photographs of some 10,000 pages to
                    his bosses, including the precise location plans for the deployment of cruise
                    missiles and Pershing II rockets in Western Europe, as well as the central MC
                    161 document (Cosmic Top Secret) which summarized the NATO strategy as well as
                    NATO's analysis of the Warsaw pact and its intentions. These documents were
                    promptly transferred to the KGB.”</p>
                <p>“He would photograph documents in his office, or take them home and photograph
                    them in his wine cellar. He met contact persons all over Europe and received
                    instructions via number stations, radio programs broadcasting messages encrypted
                    as number sequences. His British wife knew about his activities and tried to
                    persuade him to stop. He later said “At the time I did it, I believed it to be
                    my moral duty.”</p>
                <p>“NATO did not have any knowledge of the existence of Topaz until GDR officer
                    Heinz Busch defected in 1990. Busch however did not know the identity of Topaz.
                    Several meetings of the secret services of a number of countries ensued with the
                    aim of identifying Topaz, who took part in some of those meetings. With the help
                    of GDR files that had fallen into the hands of the CIA after the dissolution of
                    the GDR, Rupp was caught in 1993, while on vacation in Germany. He confessed and
                    received a prison sentence of 12 years in 1994. He was released early in July
                    2000.”</p>
                <pb facs="0364" n="Page0364"/>
                <p>“In an interview for the Channel 4 programme '1983: The Brink of Apocalypse',
                    about exercise Able Archer 83, broadcast in the UK on 5th January 2008, he said
                    that he had transmitted the message that NATO was not launching a surprise
                    nuclear attack against the USSR during the exercise to his KGB controllers. He
                    did this by way of encoding a message on a device disguised as a calculator
                    which then turned the message into a short electronic burst which could be
                    transmitted to a set telephone number. He viewed this as vital to preventing a
                    Soviet pre-emptive strike against NATO forces. It was also stated that he chose
                    the code name TOPAZ himself. More can be learned about Rupp's shadowy history
                    from www.rickhyatt.freeservers.com, where photos and other evidence is presented
                    that he actually was “Turned” by the CIA in 1977. The net effect is that he was
                    kicked upstairs to NATO economist so as to pass over false information to the
                    KGB. Thereby, he got much less jail time than he would have otherwise.”</p>
                <p>In retrospect, our theory that credible Soviet awareness that NATO was not
                    planning a first strike was actually useful to us, was borne out. Even so, its a
                    strange experience to have had a top Warsaw Pact agent in your own office. As to
                    the veracity of the claim on the cited web site that Rupp may have been a turned
                    US agent, I have no idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever run into any other spies in your career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The only other one was the alleged spy Felix Bloch, the Vienna-born
                    Foreign Service officer reportedly caught by the French in Paris passing a
                    leather bag to a known Soviet agent. Pat and I had known him and his wife in
                    Washington, where I had carpooled with him for a number of months. Stiff,
                    punctiliously dressed and a bit haughty in bearing, Felix was highly competent
                    but never much fun or a good sport.</p>
                <p>Strangely, I almost became his successor as Deputy Chief of Mission In Vienna
                    after my NATO assignment, where Felix had served under both Reagan's former
                    Assistant Helene van Damm and Ronald Lauder. I went there for an interview and
                    had dinner with Felix and his wife at their house in Doebling. He was friendly
                    and reasonably outgoing as always and raised my antennas only by his almost
                    manic pride in his vintage silver Mercedes, which stood spotlessly polished and
                    gleaming in his garage.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, Lauder and I didn't hit it off, since he seemed to be looking
                    more for a PR man than a DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember the case well. Bloch was reported to have been
                        into kinky sex, is that how he was entrapped?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0365" n="Page0365"/>
                <p>JAEGER: That's the story. The most prevalent hypothesis is that he was
                    blackmailed by the STASI, the East German Intelligence Service, over his sexual
                    proclivities during an earlier tour in East Berlin, since, being an aristocratic
                    type, he clearly detested communism and the Soviet system and would not have
                    worked for them for ideological reasons. At any rate, the FBI never managed to
                    make a case against him, since they couldn't prove what was in the leather bag.
                    When last heard from he was driving a school bus in Georgia.</p>
                <p>Curiously, in neither the Rupp nor the Bloch cases was I ever contacted by the
                    FBI, although I obviously knew both well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other memorable types cropped up during this
                        assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Although in no way related to espionage, my most difficult personnel
                    problem at NATO involved an Italian diplomat, a tall, sad-looking, elegantly
                    attired man, who was for a time head of my economic section. Although of a
                    famous family, highly cultivated and well read, he embodied the challenges
                    international staffing poses in organizations like NATO and the UN.</p>
                <p>In brief, he arrived, each day, attended my staff meetings, passed on the
                    assignments, closed his office door and often did nothing further until he left
                    in the evening. When I gave him direct personal assignments, the product was
                    almost always pedantically detailed and for all purposes useless. After some
                    months his small staff rebelled and asked me to intervene, since they felt they
                    were unfairly carrying his part of their sometimes heavy workload. When repeated
                    efforts to motivate him failed to produce results, I took the fateful step of
                    asking the NATO personnel system to transfer him to another job.</p>
                <p>Then things got sticky. Within days the Italian Ambassador to NATO invited me to
                    lunch at his residence, and after an elegant meal and expressions of admirations
                    for America and myself, made it clear over coffee and cordials that, on this
                    little matter of my Italian staffer, I needed to understand that his wife was
                    related to the Foreign Minister, that he came from a distinguished family and
                    was a very nice man, none of which I disputed. He then explained rather less
                    subtly that I needed to reverse course, since otherwise my own career might
                    suffer. The Mafia couldn't have done better.</p>
                <p>What's more, when I didn't budge, he took the matter to Lord Carrington, and to
                    the American Ambassador. Both called me in, and Carrington, in particular,
                    listened very carefully. Shortly thereafter my Economic Section chief left NATO.
                    What followed was, to me, the most incredible part of the story. He was given a
                    major promotion and made Deputy Chief of the Italian Mission to the European
                    Communities! If I am correctly informed he eventually rose to be an Italian
                    Ambassador in two important Mediterranean countries. I hope, for their sake,
                    that he made up in charm and diplomatic grace what he so sadly lacked in drive
                    and motivation.</p>
                <pb facs="0366" n="Page0366"/>
                <p>It all drove home the difficulties of international organizations whose staffs
                    are seconded by governments. Although some are excellent, the whole is diluted
                    by nepotism, as in this case, and by the tendency by others to slough of weaker
                    people. Still, we somehow managed.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On still another front, did you job involve much public
                        relations work, since this was, if I remember correctly, part of the
                        Political ASG's domain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, a great deal. Since there were only a few of us at the higher
                    political levels in the NATO structure, I was continually being asked by our
                    information people to give briefings to academic groups, members of Congress,
                    media types and miscellaneous groups of students, interested organizations etc.
                    There were often requests as well for speeches in other NATO countries, which
                    offered opportunities for travel. It was a very enjoyable part of the work.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: One was my trip to speak on NATO issues at Marmara University in
                    Istanbul. Before me in the auditorium sat several solemn rows of Turkish
                    generals, officials and professors, behind which were a crowd of journalists and
                    students. I gave my talk and all went well until, toward the end of the question
                    period, a student got up and asked how NATO managed to keep its 16 nations
                    coordinated, working in lockstep.</p>
                <p>I didn't think of the implications and gave him a very dumb answer: “Well,” I
                    said, “running NATO is a bit like it must have been running a Turkish
                    harem,...”</p>

                <p>JAEGER: That's right. But it seemed to have passed off all right and everybody
                    said I gave a pretty good speech. So I went back to my hotel feeling generally
                    pleased. However when I was leaving the next morning, the concierge said, “Oh
                    sir, I think you should know there's a demonstration against you outside!
                    Perhaps you would like to leave by another door? “</p>

                <p>JAEGER: When I peaked through a curtain I saw Turkish ladies marching around
                    before the entrance carrying large signs saying, “NATO opposed to women's
                    liberation!” and various journalist and photographers recording the scene!
                    Needless to say, I used the hotel's rear door!</p>
                <p>When I got back to Brussels and attended the Secretary General's staff meeting
                    the next meeting, Lord Carrington gave me a searching look and said, “I hear,

                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Which was as close to a reprimand as I ever got.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you survived that scrape. Were there any others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: There was a NATO tradition that about once every 10 years one of the
                    senior people would visit Iceland, the smallest member of the alliance, to call
                    on people and give some talks. It being about time, and partly at the
                    instigation of my very effective Icelandic staffer, Gunnar Palsson, I promoted
                    the idea that I should make a 10-day trip to Iceland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Iceland a military member of NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Its a bit of an anomaly. Iceland is a Charter member of the alliance, but
                    has no military of its own, and, by agreement, is under US military
                    protection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we had the important naval listening post at
                        Keflavik...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: .. which enabled us to detect Soviet fleet movements into the
                    Atlantic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you made a NATO trip to Iceland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I did and was received most warmly on my arrival. I made, not just the
                    front page, but virtually the whole front page of the main newspaper with my
                    first speech!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like in the Magdalene Islands in Quebec?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0368" n="Page0368"/>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right. I was wined and dined and gave talks all around the island
                    , including one at the very northern end of Iceland in a pleasant arctic port
                    called Akureyri, the second city of Iceland, where there is a famous bird
                    sanctuary nearby.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your speeches go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Well, I would give whatever the standard NATO briefing speech was, which
                    went well, but found that the same question always popped up afterwards: “If
                    there were war with the Soviet Union,” they would ask, “would the NATO navies
                    use nuclear weapons which would kill all of our fish?”</p>
                <p>Nobody had prepared me for this! I had no idea how many fish an underwater
                    nuclear blast would kill and in what radius. Moreover, if I gave the impression
                    that the price of being a good ally would be the loss of their main industry,
                    NATO in Iceland would be in serious trouble. So I had to think fast on my
                    feet.</p>
                <p>I assured them, making it up out of whole cloth, that while the nuclear weapons
                    were deadly against Soviet naval vessels, they had a very limited effect on
                    under water fish! Even in case of war the Icelandic fishery industry would
                    therefore be perfectly all right. I promised, that I would of course tell the
                    Secretary General of their concern and that we would do our best, in case of
                    nuclear war, to make sure that not too many fish got killed!</p>
                <p>In retrospect it was the only occasions in my career when I lied deliberately to
                    avoid what might have been a significant NATO crisis. I apologize to
                    Iceland!</p>
                <p>k. Social Life in Embassy Central</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move on, what was it like to live in
                        Brussels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Brussels was a delight. Although a large city, it has huge gardens and
                    parks, and competes favorably with Paris as a culinary nirvana. What's more its
                    close to Bruges, Ghent and other more or less preserved mediaeval towns and
                    villages, is not far from the channel coast and near the great battlefields of
                    Flanders where so much blood was spilled in the world wars.</p>
                <pb facs="0369" n="Page0369"/>
                <p>I often went there and drove around among the myriad war cemeteries, which offer
                    powerful lessons why statecraft must, above all else, creatively preserve the
                    peace. I was specially moved by the famous battlefield at Vimy Ridge, where
                    something like 200,000 men lost their lives in the course of World War I and
                    10000 Canadian casualties were incurred in a few days in their famous offensive
                    in April 1917. I had represented the US on a number of drizzly Armistice Days in
                    Quebec City when their memory was honored at the memorial below the Citadel.</p>
                <p>On a lighter note, official entertaining in Brussels was intense, since so many
                    countries have not one but two or three Embassies there, one accredited to
                    Belgium, and others, as applicable, to NATO and the European Community. So,
                    adding all the other invitations one tended to get in the higher levels at NATO
                    from military colleagues and local contacts and friends, the amount of
                    entertaining was sometimes overwhelming, since one tended to be on everybody's
                    guest lists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Too much of a good thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Since waiters tended to come from only a few catering establishments, it
                    got to the point where they would greet you at the door of whichever Embassy you
                    happened to be invited to and say things like: “ Messr. Jaeger, the Martini as
                    usual, with just a little Vermouth?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: So if one wasn't involved in the endless bickering between the Walloons
                    and the Flemish, it was an atmosphere of delightful corruption!</p>
                <p>l. Leaving Brussels</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All in all, it sounds like another rich and fascinating
                        tour. When did you leave and what happened next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: My tour ended in the late spring of '87 and after a certain amount of
                    back and forth with Senior Personnel I accepted an assignment as
                    Diplomat-in-Residence at Middlebury College in Vermont. There had again been
                    talk of a small African Embassy, but Christina, now a young adolescent lady,
                    needed a bit of stability. So we thought it wisest not to go overseas again, but
                    to do a state-side assignment and Middlebury clearly filled the bill.</p>
                <pb facs="0370" n="Page0370"/>
                <p>We had a lovely send-off. Lord and Lady Carrington graciously gave us a splendid
                    goodbye lunch at his manorial residence and Marcello Guidi, the kind, gentle,
                    and rather unhappy Deputy Secretary General, who had become a friend, offered a
                    large reception. It was a good feeling for Pat and myself that, despite
                    occasional ups and downs, our work really had been appreciated. In the meantime
                    I had also received a further promotion to Minister Counselor in the Senior
                    Foreign Service. So it was with a sense of accomplishment that we headed home
                    for, what turned out to be our last assignment in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>2. Diplomat in Residence</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we talk about your life at Middlebury, tell us just
                        a bit about the Department's Diplomat-in-Residence program and what it was
                        meant to accomplish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The idea of sending twenty or so senior American diplomats to colleges,
                    universities, think tanks and a few similar institutions each year was not to
                    propagandize current policy, but to show them that we are rational, and
                    professionally highly competent people; and that it's wrong and simplistic to
                    write us off as a bunch of flacks or cookie pushers or whatever other epithets
                    people had for us. Put another way, it was an effort to establish credibility in
                    the intellectual and academic worlds, which tends to be condescending toward the
                    Foreign Service, even though my experience was that many of them avidly called
                    on us at overseas posts and appreciated - and then used - the information and
                    analysis we offered.</p>
                <p>Although its a freebee for the institutions involved, the Diplomat in Residence
                    program is prestigious since we, after all, are the practitioners who can offer
                    courses and seminars based not only on theory but on experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did make out at Middlebury?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: After a day of meetings with at least a dozen professors, a not-too
                    camouflaged way of finding out whether I 'would do', I was told by President
                    Olin Robison that I had 'passed' with flying colors and, on in response to my
                    question as to what he would like me to do, was told that could do or teach
                    whatever I wanted.</p>
                <pb facs="0371" n="Page0371"/>
                <p>So I organized several new courses and seminars, including an Introductory
                    International Relations course, and brought a series of notable practitioners to
                    campus, including my recent chief, Ambassador Henning Wegener. Olin Robison was
                    surprised when I wanted to put Wegener into a 400 seat auditorium, and thought
                    only a handful would show up for a German diplomat. I organized a dozen
                    undergraduates to put up posters and hand bills in every dormitory, and when the
                    evening came filled the place to overflowing. I should add that Henning gave a
                    thoroughly rousing lecture, brought the house down, and was the talk of the
                    campus for several days. In the course I gave on NATO, I used the same technique
                    of leavening our political, organizational and strategic readings and discussion
                    with a series of high-level guests from State, the Joint Chief's Staff and NATO
                    Embassies in Washington. The result was a lively mix of theory, analysis and
                    contact with top-flight people who were directly involved, to which the students
                    responded enthusiastically.</p>
                <p>In the course of my first year I noticed that, even though Middlebury was only a
                    couple hours drive from the Canadian border, nobody had the slightest interest
                    in Canada. So I went to Olin Robison and said, “Olin, I'd like to give a course
                    about Quebec and Canada.” He laughed and said “Be my guest, whatever you want to
                    do! But nobody's going to come!”</p>
                <p>Well, when it was announced as a seminar for the following winter term, the
                    course was substantially oversubscribed and I had to turn people away. We did
                    three weeks of intensive reading and daily seminar discussions, and concluded
                    the course with an eight-day trip to Ottawa, Montreal, and Quebec City which I
                    had prepared to show them the huge contrasts in perceptions in these three very
                    different Canadian cities. They met everyone from the then Governor General of
                    Canada, government Ministers, key journalists and our Embassy people in Ottawa;
                    Jacques Parizeau, then teaching at the University of Montreal; CEOs of ALCAN (
                    Canadian Aluminum) and other companies in Montreal; and leading Liberal and
                    Parti Qu�b�cois personalities in Quebec City. Our students' hard work paid off.
                    They asked very intelligent questions and came away with a sharp new awareness
                    of the nationalist passions they encountered, particularly in the Quebec part of
                    the visit - an impression softened but not erased by the Quebec Carnival
                    celebration which was the grand finale, at twenty five below zero! In short the
                    course was a great success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you develop any ideas how students can be taught to
                        think in policy terms, rather than just regurgitating facts?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0372" n="Page0372"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Actually yes. In my second year (Olin had asked that I stay a second
                    year) I required my seminar students to write option papers rather than the term
                    papers they were accustomed to, following the format used in the Department.
                    They called for a concise statement of the problem, a tight background summary
                    and then a list of the actions that might be taken to deal with it, each with
                    notations of probable benefits and costs. In real life the Secretary or other
                    policy maker could then choose among them or ask for more ideas. The best
                    students thrived on this. The rest, I am afraid, had a hard time. But then good
                    policy makers are rare in colleges as they are in real life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sounds like an interesting technique, which could
                        usefully be adopted in various courses. Did you want to go on to another
                        assignment after Middlebury?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The Department asked me if would be interested in becoming Director of
                    Egyptian Affairs, which, given the situation in the Middle East, would have been
                    a very challenging assignment, although one for which I felt genuinely
                    unqualified. I pointed out that I was neither an Arabist nor had I ever served
                    in the Middle East and so would have to begin at the bottom of the learning
                    curve. Inflicting such a neophyte on the Ambassador and his staff in Cairo as
                    their Washington interlocutor seemed unfair.</p>
                <p>Moreover, after thirty four years in the Foreign Service, going off on new
                    adventures would have meant more sacrifices for our family. Christina, now in
                    her teens, loved her life at Kent School in Connecticut. And both Pat, who had
                    for so long been such an enormous help and support, and I felt that it was time
                    to begin to think a bit of ourselves. So after some reflection we decided that
                    this was a good time to thank the Foreign Service for a wonderful career and
                    very rich life, to build a house in Vermont and to live there happily ever after
                    - which we have done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that I think wraps up a fascinating career.</hi>

                <p>Part X. Reflections and Ruminations</p>
                <p>1. Why a career Foreign Service?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We talked about doing some general reflections about the
                        Service, the Department and policy. Why don't we begin with the basic
                        question why we should have a career Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0373" n="Page0373"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Almost all states now have professional diplomatic services which evolved
                    from the small aristocratic in-groups who advised rulers on external affairs and
                    served as envoys to other states. The advantage is that a professional
                    diplomatic service attracts bright and ambitious people, concentrates expertise
                    about the foreign realm and nurtures policy-making and negotiating skills. Its
                    disadvantage is that it can get ossified, rigid and traditional in its thinking,
                    and, as is still the case in some counties, a reserve for otherwise unemployable
                    offspring of important families. In the US, with its Presidential system, there
                    is the additional problem that people around the White House and the National
                    Security Council often reach different conclusions than the professionals and
                    sideline the Service to have their way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there alternatives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The New York Times a few years ago suggested the Service be replaced by
                    an open market organization of the best and the brightest, competing for higher
                    salaries, who would be more creative than the Foreign Service. I think that's a
                    non-starter since a world-wide diplomatic service must have discipline to
                    function and these hyper-competitive folks, while presumably brilliant and
                    ambitious, would tend to cater to power to advance and would not necessarily
                    have either the depth of background or judgment which is so important to make
                    American foreign policy work.</p>
                <p>Another, more conventional idea, is to simply fold the Foreign Service into the
                    civil service system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Foreign Service differ from the civil service
                        model in your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Oh, it differs in important respects. First of all, it is much more
                    selective. Getting into the Foreign Service, as you know, requires first a
                    written exam which eliminates the majority of applicants, and then, at least in
                    my time, a very demanding oral examination. So entrance requirements have
                    traditionally been much steeper than those imposed on the civil service. While
                    the exams have been greatly changed in recent years, and this has by many
                    accounts reduced the selectivity of the process, the bar certainly does remain
                    higher than is the case with average civil service appointees.</p>
                <p>There are others difference. Foreign Service officers bind themselves to a
                    discipline not required of civil service officers. If you're in the civil
                    service and you're offered a job somewhere else, you are free to accept it or
                    reject it. In the Foreign Service you can express your interest in positions
                    when you're ready for transfer. Ultimately, however, the system can hold you to
                    the commitment that, when they say, “Okay, the talking is over. You are going to
                    such and such a place to do such and such a job,” you are required to go,
                    whether its overseas service at hardship posts or whatever.</p>
                <pb facs="0374" n="Page0374"/>
                <p>The reason this is so important derives from the need to staff large numbers of
                    Embassies and Consulates all over the world, as well as the State Department,
                    out of a pool, in my time, of about 5,000 people. As in any game of blind man's
                    buff, somebody will not get exactly what they wanted. But the needs of the
                    service require some people some of the time to gracefully accept assignments
                    they would not otherwise have chosen.</p>
                <p>You could never do that with an all-civil service system, which, as a result,
                    could not reliably staff all our overseas posts, particularly those where there
                    are trying living conditions and physical risks. The Department's recent
                    insistence that some FSOs go to Iraq to do local development work illustrates
                    the point, even though there is validity, in this particular case, to the
                    counter argument many raised that service under combat conditions was not part
                    of their commitment and so should not be required of diplomats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in this respect, the Foreign Service rather
                        resembles the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes. Foreign Service discipline, at least as I experienced it, is
                    somewhere between that of the civil and military service.</p>
                <p>2. Preparation and Training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about the background and training which
                        you would look for in a good Foreign Service officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: This gets to the qualities we look for in first-rate FSO's. Many of the
                    jobs in the Foreign Service necessarily require extensive language and area
                    knowledge, sensitivity to other peoples and cultures, negotiating and
                    administrative skills and that indefinable personal quality called judgment -
                    which you build up by accretions of successive experiences and insights, by
                    learning from mistakes made by yourself or others, by reading history, studying
                    philosophy and perhaps religion, and which gradually coalesces into something
                    that's hard to put your finger on, but which professionals very often are able
                    to recognize quickly: The ability to synthesize very complex human, political,
                    country or global situations and come up with perceptive assessments, not only
                    of the news flash variety, but assessments and recommendations that will stand
                    the test of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this respect, the Foreign Service must be distinct
                        among all forms of government service.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0375" n="Page0375"/>
                <p>JAEGER: I think so. I think one of the reasons for the wisdom of a career system
                    which is fairly disciplined, rigorous, hard to get into, and makes considerable
                    demands on people both intellectually, character-wise, and in terms of their
                    willingness to serve, is that it provides the nation with a pool of not only
                    highly knowledgeable, versatile, flexible and effective people, but also of
                    people who have wisdom and strength of character to deal even with the most
                    difficult situations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent did the Foreign Service, in your
                        experience, approach that ideal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: You know, when you look at Embassies you can always come up with horror
                    stories. The Foreign Service as a group is not only composed of saints and
                    exceptional people. All of us have feelings, ambition. We have ego. We are
                    jealous of each other and sometimes resentful in a very competitive system.
                    Administrative arrangements can go horribly wrong. Young officers who need
                    development and training don't always respond the way one would have hoped they
                    would. You see too many people bending to the prevailing winds, making lousy
                    decisions and then you see the predictable consequences, usually involving
                    suffering by others.</p>
                <p>Even so, most of the time the Foreign Service serves the country well, at least
                    to the extent its masters permit. I think the fact that it is rigorously
                    selected, that it accepts the discipline of functioning in a hierarchy, of the
                    assignment process and the up and out promotion system produces a quite
                    exceptional group, whose quality is further enhanced by peer pressure and shared
                    experience. We've had senior business executives on Foreign Service promotion
                    boards - people who came to this with a bit of a chip on their shoulders,
                    saying, “Well, you know, we come from industry where we have real people, and
                    now we're going to take a look at these cookie pushers,” - who have come away
                    deeply impressed, saying they wished they had people of this quality in the
                    industries they work in.</p>
                <p>My conclusion is that, as has been the practice the last couple hundred years,
                    nations are well served by having elite career diplomatic services: Elite, not
                    in the sense of all of them coming from Harvard, Yale or Princeton - although
                    they should not be excluded since they often produce very good people - but
                    elite in the sense that they are carefully and demandingly screened; broadly
                    educated; focused on developing their knowledge and character; and, most
                    importantly, that they be people of great integrity and the ability to make
                    soundly balanced, rather than ideologically motivated, judgments about very
                    complex situations.</p>
                <pb facs="0376" n="Page0376"/>
                <p>There is one last factor. Good judgement can only try to select the best among,
                    what is usually, an array of poor or costly choices. There are journalists,
                    academics, and others who look back on situations and say, “Well, they shouldn't
                    have done it that way.” The diplomat has to make his decisions at 9:25 in the
                    morning at staff meeting or whenever he's asked by his Ambassador, the Under
                    Secretary or whoever: “So what do we do about this?” At that point you have to
                    function with the amount of knowledge that you have that day, that minute, the
                    amount of strength you have in your soul, and the articulateness you can muster
                    at the time.</p>
                <p>The world is a fast-changing kaleidoscope, where the impingement of multiple
                    factors on each other can produce outcomes which even the best of minds don't
                    necessarily foresee. Paradoxically, good diplomats therefore also need to be
                    able to absolve regret over situations where 'sound' judgments did not turn out
                    as intended or expected. You learn over time that you and others can only do
                    their utmost, but that even that is not always good enough in steering the boat
                    through usually tricky and roiled waters.</p>
                <p>3. Formal training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Let's now turn to the formal training the
                        Department provided in your time. How did they do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Haphazardly. There were training courses, like the mid-career course,
                    which provided some brief time for reading and reflection. Language training
                    also offered limited country and area background study. And, the National War
                    College, as we discussed, was an exceptional opportunity to fill in gaps -
                    although here again much time was wasted on organizational briefings and rather
                    too basic presentations. That said, some parts of it, and particularly the
                    overseas trip at the end of the year were very valuable.</p>
                <p>Still, when I think about it all in retrospect I am amazed how sketchily prepared
                    I was for each of my assignments, and to what extent one was expected to 'hit
                    the ground running' and to learn as one went along. One did, of course, meet
                    with the country desks before going out and to read up on recent cable traffic.
                    But the rest was left to ourselves. I went to Liberia without a clue as to the
                    issues the US and the West were facing in Africa as the colonial period was
                    coming to an end and no opportunity to reflect on the huge development issues
                    which were facing us and our aid programs. I did of course, learn fast and
                    remember reading and collecting a small library on African history and issues.
                    But these were personal initiatives.</p>
                <p>The same thing happened again and again, in all my overseas assignments. The
                    Department largely relied on the fact that most of us were bright and highly
                    motivated, and expected us to pick up fast enough to do a good job. Many
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0377" n="Page0377"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In practical terms, how did this affect the quality of
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The day-to-day work very little, since there is a causal continuity in
                    the evolution of ongoing issues which one learns quickly. The real trouble can
                    arise when long-term perspective is needed. Its there where the people with
                    deeper understanding of history and culture are needed to avoid major mistakes.
                    For instance, if our key people in Monrovia had had a more ingoing understanding
                    of African tribal society the disasters caused by our road building projects and
                    other inept AID and military initiatives might not have occurred. We have
                    currently seen the implications of superficial historic and country knowledge in
                    Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has this improved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I think the new Foreign Service Institute does a better job, at least at
                    the junior and middle levels. The real problems arise at senior levels, when
                    people are promoted beyond their depth or when political appointees project
                    their US-derived 'beliefs' and 'convictions' on foreign situations. The mistakes
                    and bloodshed caused by the neo-cons and others at highest levels in the current
                    Bush II administration starkly illustrate the point. Its at these top levels
                    that lack of historic knowledge and sensitivity to the complexities of societies
                    can do the most harm. As de Tocqueville said, our democracy is the best possible
                    system except in the foreign policy domain, where wise answers are not
                    necessarily provided by counting noses or by the people the process
                    produces.</p>
                <p>As a result, Presidents and their immediate advisors tend to look suspiciously at
                    the Foreign Service, because its a knowledge and experience bank which doesn't
                    always tow the party line.</p>
                <p>4. Generalists versus Specialists</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a current trend in academia that you don't have
                        to know much about a country in order to generalize about it and compare it
                        with other countries that you don't know very much about either. It's the
                        generalist driving out the specialist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: We, of course, do have specialists In the Foreign Service as well, people
                    whose careers focus on consular work or administration, or who become political
                    or economic or political-military experts on parts of the world like Europe,
                    China, Russia or the Middle East. They will typically know the relevant
                    languages and have served several times in assignments in their area of special
                    experience abroad or in Washington. Even so, the 'pure' specialists, as they
                    appear in the academic world, are rare, except for the civil servants who spend
                    long periods on particular countries or issues as analysts in the Bureau of
                    Intelligence and Research. But even they are disappearing and often being
                    replaced by more generalist Foreign Service officers.</p>
                <pb facs="0378" n="Page0378"/>
                <p>So, while many of us do become specialists to a greater or lesser degree - in my
                    case on the whole range of east-west issues during the Cold War - the system
                    also tries hard to bring us along as generalists and managers. Most of us, in
                    the course of our careers, were deliberately assigned to a wide range of
                    functions and places with the idea that, when we reached more senior positions,
                    the accumulation of experiences across countries, issues and cultures would
                    hopefully produce a person of adequate breadth and depth to function wisely and
                    effectively at that level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This seems to run counter to much contemporary American
                        culture, which looks to instant expertise in public affairs, business etc..
                        It's this accumulation of wisdom, if you want to call it that, which the
                        public doesn't fully appreciate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right, and something Administrations over the last decades have
                    not always appreciated.</p>
                <p>5. Political Appointees</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that connection, how does the practice of appointing
                        political ambassadors square with everything you've been talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's a mixed bag. There are some political Ambassadors, like Rohatyn,
                    Dillon or Admiral Crowe, who would be outstanding in any context. But problems
                    frequently arise with non-career Ambassadors who are appointed to pay off
                    political debts. That's how you get Finance Chairmen of Republican or Democratic
                    Party committees and folks who made major financial contributions to campaigns.
                    There has even been some sort of informal pay scale, if you give $200,000 you
                    get this kind of an Embassy but for $400,000 you get a better one. For example,
                    in Austria and Switzerland, even in Belgium and Holland and other second level
                    European countries - not to mention Barbados...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: ... and places like that - you tend to get successions of extremely
                    forgettable people. They are usually not appreciated by the country where they
                    are serving, since everybody knows how they got the job, and, in many cases, are
                    often a cross for the Foreign Service staff who work under them.</p>
                <pb facs="0379" n="Page0379"/>
                <p>All this impairs their effectiveness. An American Ambassador in Holland should
                    not only be able to charm the Dutch but has to represent us on a vast range of
                    difficult issues, from political- military matters on NATO's agenda, to European
                    and east-west problems, tariffs and other economic controversies and the whole
                    world-wide range of developments and crises which constantly arise. Political
                    Ambassadors who don't have the necessary background or real interest in all this
                    are clearly a handicap. My own experience, particularly in Canada and France,
                    illustrates the point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do other countries have this practice of appointing large
                        numbers of political Ambassadorships?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Very few. It's creeping in to some extent in some services, but it's not
                    viewed as a useful practice for the reasons we have discussed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there much entry into diplomatic positions below the
                        ambassadorial level from outside the service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: In my time, Foreign Service positions were rather sacrosanct. While there
                    was a significant number of political Ambassadorial appointments, the system as
                    such remained protected. We now have interlopers at all levels of the
                    Department. One way to do this is to work on a campaign, attract attention and
                    end up with a job at the National Security Council or in one of the other
                    cabinet level operations. You then get yourself moved to State on a temporary
                    basis and eventually try to get a lateral appointment in the Foreign Service.
                    Sometimes it works and sometimes not.</p>
                <p>More insidious is the practice, recently more prevalent, of deliberately
                    appointing some of these ideologically vetted people to secondary and
                    middle-level jobs presumably to keep an eye on things and make sure the White
                    House line is being followed. I even heard of a case of a very unprofessional
                    Consul in one of the former Soviet Republics who was that sort of political
                    appointee.</p>
                <p>5. Promotions, assignments and the 'up-and-out system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about the Foreign Service promotion
                        system. How does it work and how well?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0380" n="Page0380"/>
                <p>JAEGER: The State Department has a class system, rather like the military.
                    Currently it goes from Class Six to Class One, one being the highest. Then there
                    is a bar, which, if you make it across, leads to the Senior Foreign Service,
                    whose four further classes are, roughly speaking, comparable to the general
                    officer ranks in the military. I got as far as Minister Counselor, which would
                    correspond to two stars in the military.</p>
                <p>People are promoted by selection boards who read everybody's annual efficiency
                    reports in the class they are reviewing, efficiency reports having first been
                    reviewed by each rater's immediate superior and then by a local committee of
                    peers. So every effort is made to make them as fair as possible. The promotion
                    boards then discuss and collegially 'rank order' people from the best to the
                    last guy in the class, which determines who will be promoted first, second,
                    third, fourth, and so on. State's administrative people then say, “Well, we can
                    promote 63 people this year in this class.” So the first 63 get promoted, and
                    the guy who was 64th doesn't get promoted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does failure to get promoted in a given year mean you
                        never will be or you're tops for the next go around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: No, it has to be earned again. You're not tops automatically next time
                    around, because the next board might look at you differently, and your next
                    efficiency report might say you got worse or you got better, and so on.</p>
                <p>In principle the system is quite fair. Where it's problems arise are as follows:
                    First, the situations and tasks are very different in different places. How do
                    you rate an officer who is number two in some minor African Consulate and does
                    very well under the very difficult conditions there, which, however, may not
                    require very broad issue knowledge or negotiating skills, as against somebody
                    who is the Staff Assistant to the Undersecretary of State dealing only with the
                    most important questions the country faces? Its obviously very difficult to make
                    this kind of judgment in comparing officers, particularly when you are only
                    reading written reports.</p>
                <p>Secondly, there is a huge amount of verbal inflation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has it got worse recently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Perhaps. When I first entered the Service there was still a confidential
                    section in efficiency reports which was not shown to the person being rated. So
                    a superior could write you a very nice sounding efficiency report and then
                    deflate it in the secret portion, This duplicitous system was changed in the
                    late '50s or early '60s. Now an officer has the right to see and comment on his
                    entire report.</p>
                <pb facs="0381" n="Page0381"/>
                <p>This has, of course, created the new difficulty that it takes more character to
                    write a blunt but honest report, i.e. “This officer is mediocre and is probably
                    in the wrong job!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: How do you sustain an effective working relationship with somebody once
                    resentment and insecurity is high, and everybody deals at arms length? So people
                    tend to write inflated reports in which almost everybody gets a 'good'
                    efficiency report. But the goats are then separated from the sheep by subtle
                    gradations in language and innuendo. So promotion boards have to be very skilled
                    at reading between the lines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give an example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Let's say if you write a report that says, “Joe is a very competent
                    officer who's done a very good job. He has shown initiative several times and
                    made significant progress in handling difficult situations....” the promotion
                    board knows that they're not supposed to promote this guy. On the other hand, if
                    you say, “This officer has culminated several years of brilliant performance
                    with a series of feats which surpass expectations, he is long overdue for
                    promotion and we strongly urge that he be promoted by this board,” they also get
                    the message.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This must become particularly difficult when decisions are
                        involved of separating marginal officers in the up-or-out system, no?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: No doubt. I can't speak to how this is done currently. In my time people
                    who were ranked in the bottom 5% of the Service three years in a row were
                    subject to selection out. As a result of the case of an officer who committed
                    suicide on being selected out before the age of fifty, because he and his family
                    would have received no pension, the rule was amended to allow people to serve to
                    the time of their pension eligibility. The more usual result of average
                    performance is that officers are simply not promoted into the Senior Foreign
                    Service, and then given a few more years to retirement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sounds reasonable. How about assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0382" n="Page0382"/>
                <p>JAEGER: That's the most difficult area, since so much depends on current
                    personnel needs, the corridor impression of the officer being assigned,
                    personalities in the Bureau to which he or she is being assigned, and the extent
                    to which string pulling is involved and effective. The formal system looks fair
                    on the surface. There is now a 'bidding' process for jobs, before assignment
                    decisions are made. In practice I, for one, never understood why I was given one
                    assignment rather than another.</p>
                <p>6. Reporting and the policymaking process</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A related question that has always intrigued me is, how
                        well and how far the upper echelons of the foreign policy system respond to
                        people who are reporting from the trenches, as you did throughout much or
                        your career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: It differs. As a rule of thumb the less people at the highest levels are
                    interested in the areas or issues one is working on the more likely it is that
                    one can have considerable, sometimes unchallenged influence. Certainly desk
                    officers and country directors, even Assistant Secretaries will oversee. But if
                    suggestions from the field are reasonable and well argued and not too far out of
                    the mainstream, there is a good likelihood they will prevail. Problems arise
                    when one whistles into prevailing winds, particularly the jet streams blowing at
                    high altitudes. For instance, remember my account of the Iranian desk's reaction
                    when I expressed deep concern over what I had seen in Iran on my War College
                    trip. He completely agreed, but was unable to prevent the crisis because Nixon
                    and his staff were committed to a policy of excessive support for the Shah.</p>
                <p>So, yes. All the thousands of telegrams which pour into Washington daily from
                    posts around the world do have effect and many are followed up on and
                    implemented. But its a complex, obstacle-studded process, in which the fate of
                    issues depends on the political configuration surrounding each one in the
                    foreign policy bureaucracy. A highly respected or politically powerful
                    Ambassador can help, although only so often, since they too cannot outrun their
                    credit with their patrons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you try to describe how it works in somewhat greater
                        detail?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: As we said, the less important the issue, the easier it all works, while
                    issues which are at the center of public, White House, or '7th floor' interest,
                    usually bring the entire system into play. For example, on important East-West
                    issues, major arms control questions etc., the full foreign and security
                    machinery would jump into action and feed into a central decision-making
                    process.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0383" n="Page0383"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean all the other agencies as well as the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: All the relevant agencies and all interested parts and levels of the
                    Department. For example, if our Mutual Balanced Force Reduction Mission in
                    Vienna sent in recommendations for the next phase of the talks you would get
                    Pentagon reactions. You would have the arms control experts in ACDA feeding in
                    analyses and recommendations. There might be Policy Planning staff comments, and
                    people in State, as well as NSC concerned with arms control and in East-West
                    relations would all feed into the process.</p>
                <p>The inputs would then be digested into options papers, considered and perhaps
                    revised at Department and interdepartmental meetings, and then shaped into final
                    recommendations and options for decision by the Secretary or perhaps the
                    President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Might it be debated in the National Security Council?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Certainly by the NSC staffs and their interdepartmental committee system.
                    The National Security Council still meets occasionally, but decisions are now
                    usually made in NSC working groups and, when appropriate, ratified by the NSC.
                    As a practical matter, more and more power has in recent decades drifted to the
                    NSC staff under the National Security Advisor, as well as to the Secretaries of
                    Defense and State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK. But now back to my original question: How well are the
                        views of the diplomatic people in the field absorbed and incorporated, even
                        into the State Department's positions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Embassy reporting is automatically distributed to all interested offices
                    and agencies at all appropriate levels. So everybody gets it. The problem is not
                    distribution, which works well, but excessive volume. Certainly, desk officers
                    follow Embassy reporting very carefully and incorporate Embassy views in
                    recommendations to their superiors. But even they, responsible for only one
                    country, set of issues or region, often declare themselves overwhelmed by the
                    volume of traffic and find it hard to keep up with the details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Desk officers have usually served in the countries they
                        deal with, no?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0384" n="Page0384"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Usually, but not always, as my proposed assignment to run the Egyptian
                    desk illustrates. Normally they know their country or area well. They also know
                    the people who are reporting from their Mission, their predilections, strengths
                    and weaknesses. So they have a feeling for what makes sense and what not. On the
                    other hand, they do reflect the Washington perspective and understand the
                    attitudes in the building on various issues. As a result, if an Embassy swims
                    against the tide, the desk officer sometimes tries to head them off and inflects
                    reporting. Embassies, on the other hand, inevitably tend to take on the
                    coloration of the country to which they are accredited to some extent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Localitis, I think its called.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: That's right, and its a necessary part of the dialogue, since the Embassy
                    has the more intense local exposure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, apart from the complexity of the coordinating
                        mechanisms, what is the biggest impediment to good communication?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: The vast volume of reporting, particularly at the Department's higher
                    levels, where only the most important messages are read in full and a few of the
                    next most important included in daily summaries. As a result, a great deal of
                    the nuance is lost, which is often critical. Attempts are made again and again
                    to limit reporting. But as long as efficiency reports place emphasis on
                    officers' reporting performance, and our code rooms can receive and transmit
                    almost unlimited amounts of coded paper, reporting volume is not likely to
                    shrink. So it's a bit of a dilemma.</p>
                <p>7. Relations with other agencies</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go to the question of people from other Departments
                        working in Embassies. We now have a raft of attach�s representing all the
                        different parts of the US government which have some interest in foreign
                        affairs. How effective is the cooperation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: State relations are no longer confined to political and military
                    questions, if they ever were. So Embassies have increasingly become miniature
                    replicas of the parts of governments who have foreign interests or
                    responsibilities. The trick is how make them all sing from the same page.</p>
                <pb facs="0385" n="Page0385"/>
                <p>By Presidential directives the Ambassador is, of course, the conductor, the
                    centralizing authority who is supposed to supervise and be privy to everything
                    they do. In practice this presents problems since many of them have their own
                    secure communications, or, if not, can get directives from their agency in
                    Washington by phone or mail. In any case, Embassies have become so large, that
                    neither the Ambassador nor even the Deputy Chief of Mission can always stay
                    abreast of everything. The problems tend to get worse when there is a weak
                    Ambassador, or one who doesn't have much clout in Washington.</p>
                <p>Normally, the public relations people, formerly USIA, the commercial attach�s who
                    deal with the foreign business community, the agricultural attach�s who report
                    on crops and issues affecting agricultural tariffs etc., the Treasury attach�s
                    who coordinate monetary policies, present few problems beyond the exigencies of
                    coordination, which usually happens routinely and effectively at staff
                    meetings.</p>
                <p>The military and intelligence agencies can be a challenge, and have been known to
                    do end runs or go off on uncoordinated operations of their own. This has been
                    specially troublesome in recent years, when Special Forces or intelligence teams
                    with a charter to go after 'terrorists' have been known to run covert ops
                    without Embassy knowledge or approval. This. I believe, was rare in my time,
                    since both Station Chiefs and Military Attach�s were normally careful to keep
                    the Ambassador informed if there is risk of some operation going wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are the Military attach�s sometimes telling the Pentagon
                        more than they tell their own Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: To what extent people with separate communications systems and separate
                    clienteles in Washington, in fact, share all their knowledge is debatable.
                    Certainly these channels are often used to get their agencies to push for action
                    in Washington when they can't persuade the Ambassador or his staffs on the
                    ground. Although in most Embassies the relations between the various components
                    are good and sometimes excellent, there are situations where this was not the
                    case and produced an atmosphere of distrust.</p>
                <p>Indeed there have been periodic crises in which Ambassadors and the State
                    Department have gone to the President and tried to get reaffirmation in writing
                    that the Ambassador is the President's representative and therefore entitled to
                    have full knowledge of what happens in the framework of his embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well were the non-diplomatic attach�s generally
                        prepared to deal in the given foreign culture?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0386" n="Page0386"/>
                <p>JAEGER: That too varied widely. There were many attach�s I knew who were superb,.
                    There were others who nobody should have ever thought of sending to an Embassy.
                    The CIA is hardest to judge in this respect. They have their own culture, their
                    own very difficult tasks to perform, sometimes very dangerous tasks. By and
                    large, the Chiefs of Station I knew, like Ray Cline in Bonn, were outstanding
                    people, who were highly cooperative, highly experienced, and all-around major
                    assets. But this is not universally the case.</p>
                <p>8. The Foreign Service's standing with the public and the political
                    establishment</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another key issue which affects policy is the standing of
                        the Foreign Service and the Department in the eyes of the political
                        establishment and the American public.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: There is a strange ambivalence. On the one hand, average people are
                    respectful and sincerely interested when they learn that one is or was a member
                    of the Foreign Service. On the other, this usually does not translate into
                    effective political clout - even less so today than in the early Cold War years,
                    when the Service was still dominated by then highly respected members of the
                    east coast establishment. People like Kennan, Bohlen, David Bruce, Butterworth,
                    McCloy and others of that caliber were very influential.</p>
                <p>In more recent decades successive administrations have increasingly turned the
                    Service into an implementing agency, rather than a primary source of foreign
                    policy advice. Politicians who win high office and have strong views don't want
                    to be told by Foreign Service experts that they are off the mark and need to
                    redirect their shot.</p>
                <p>There has also been a price paid as a result of the steadily increasing efforts
                    to 'democratize” the Foreign Service - implied quotas for woman and people from
                    various minorities - as well as the upgrading to 'Foreign Service' status of
                    vast numbers of bureaucrats in AID, USIA and other agencies. I don't argue
                    against the principle that the Foreign Service should be open to all without
                    prejudice, assuming high standards are maintained. Nor do I question that all
                    who work in foreign affairs, at home and abroad, should have appropriate status.
                    That said, its also true that these leveling trends have tended to leave the
                    impression that the Foreign Service is just another group of government
                    employees and so has weakened rather then enhanced its already limited domestic
                    prestige and influence. What used to be perceived as the diplomatic service of
                    the United States has become a crowd of people doing all sorts of things in
                    foreign affairs.</p>
                <p>Add to that that the Foreign Service has never been good ad promoting and
                    advertising itself, and you get a situation where most Americans have a much
                    higher regard for our military, which they generally admire and trust, than our
                    'cookie-pushing', 'striped pants' Foreign Service, assuming even that they have
                    the vaguest idea of what it is and does. The proof of the pudding is the
                    relative ease with which vast Pentagon budgets are passed by Congress as
                    compared to the frequently uphill fights for necessary minor increases at
                    State.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has the rise of the military as a major foreign policy
                        player contributed to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Unquestionably. We tend to be impatient with ambiguity and complex
                    long-term policies. Diplomacy is associated by many with pussy-footing and
                    fudging. Military action, by contrast, is direct and simple to understand.
                    Moreover, as Chris Hedges has written so eloquently ( in his book “War is the
                    Force which gives us Meaning”, an essay on the Bosnian conflicts, and in
                    Salon.com and elsewhere on Iraq), people tend to idealize war before and in the
                    early phases of conflicts. The full horror and disillusionment only sets in
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>9. National policy making and its problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Secretary of State used to be the President's
                        principal advisor on foreign policy issues. To what extent has the greatly
                        increased size and role of the National Security Council contributed to
                        lessening the role of State and the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: A great deal. When I think back to the situation under Truman and
                    Acheson, the NSC was a cabinet committee of those Department heads involved in
                    foreign affairs, whose secretariat - as I learned when I almost went to work
                    there - consisted of only a handful of people.</p>
                <p>Today the NSC is an organization of hundreds, coordinating and overseeing State,
                    Defense, the intelligence world etc. As a result most of the really influential
                    jobs are there rather than in the Department. Although State makes inputs at all
                    levels and the Secretary can, to an extent, still dominate the situation, most
                    'policy' these days is produced in the complex interdepartmental process which
                    the NSC oversees.</p>
                <p>Besides producing compromises which may or may not be the best policies to
                    address actual challenges the country faces, it increases the voice of Defense
                    and others to a much greater extent than in the past. Rumsfeld's ability to
                    dominate the system during his time as Secretary of Defense illustrates the
                    point.</p>
                <p>10. Ideas for Foreign Policy Reform</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't that inevitable, given the scope and complexity of
                        America's vastly expanded foreign and security responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0388" n="Page0388"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes and no. Certainly coordinating the nitty-gritty of policy
                    implementation across the foreign affairs and military agencies requires a
                    committee system at the White House level. However, the definition of sound
                    underlying policies has to be based on a much more detached assessment of
                    America's and the world's long-term interests and a prudent choice of means to
                    achieve these ends - means which do not exceed our financial, physical and moral
                    capacities.</p>
                <p>Both Louis Halle and Charles Burton Marshall, of Acheson's Policy Planning Staff,
                    wrote brilliantly about this most fundamental aspect of sound policy making in
                    their books on 'Civilization and Foreign Policy' and 'The Limits of Foreign
                    Policy' respectively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you would argue for basic reform of our policy making
                        process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Yes, very much so. They key is to sanitize the process as much as
                    possible from the huge bureaucratic pressures the various foreign affairs and
                    security agencies exert to protect their turfs and perceived interests. Making
                    national policy the common denominator of what all these major players can agree
                    on, as we do now in most areas, has produced and is bound to continue to
                    produce, results which are often misaligned and out of sync with evolving world
                    realities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What could be done about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I think the various recent studies on State Department reorganization
                    make some valid points, that there's a need for more security, need for
                    modernization, need for better communication, need for better technology, bigger
                    budgets, and what have you.</p>
                <p>I, myself, think that a much more radical reorganization of foreign affairs and
                    policy making in this country is necessary.</p>
                <p>The key is to find a way to focus the country's efforts on the right, rather than
                    on illusory or misleading ends, and then select appropriate means to get there.
                    This is extremely hard to do in a democracy. Even so it has become vital that we
                    stop chasing the wrong rabbits and achieve some accuracy in focusing our
                    efforts. My preference would be a return to something like the Acheson Policy
                    Planning Staff of a dozen or so, otherwise disinterested people, selected for
                    their wisdom, breadth of experience and historic understanding. Their task would
                    be to look at the world situation dispassionately and to define the most
                    critical challenges facing us, challenges whose management and solution would
                    then, if the President approved, become the ends of policy. Vague formulations
                    like the 'war on terror' or the spreading of 'democracy' obviously wouldn't make
                    the cut.</p>
                <pb facs="0389" n="Page0389"/>
                <p>Once agreed - the list would be reviewed periodically - the next step would be
                    the hammering out of effective long-term means which neither exceeded our
                    material or moral resources. This is clearly a tall order. Even so, the one time
                    it was tried in the early post-World War II years, it produced much better
                    long-term results than we have had more recently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Seat of the pants question: What do you think such a list
                        of national ends might look like in this year 2008, around which national
                        foreign and security policy might be built?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I would guess they would come up with a list of overriding national
                    interests, which would prioritize the ends of policy, along lines like
                    these:</p>
                <p>-Reducing and, if possible, reversing global warming, which can over the
                    nexthundreds of years make much of the earth uninhabitable. - -In that
                    connection, urgently creating non-polluting fuels for world-wideconsumption, and
                    dealing effectively with the increasingly serious population andfood crises. -
                    -Eliminating WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) proliferation, in the
                    firstinstance by world-wide nuclear disarmament. -</p>
                <p>- Ameliorating the dangerous disparities between rich and poor nations, whichlead
                    to regional instability and terrorism.</p>
                <p>-Responding to the shift in the world's tectonic plates, byrecognizing that
                    theabove primary problems can only besolved by a new system of
                    world-widecooperation between all the emerging great powers, China, India,
                    Russia, Europe,perhaps Brazil, and an eventually reconstituted Middle East. -
                    None of these problems can be solved by the US alone or by American military
                    power. American 'hegemony' has therefore had its day and must yield as soon as
                    possible to a creative new multilateralism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that sounds sensible. Where would such a policy
                        staff be located, in the Department or the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I think the ideal, but probably unrealistic approach, would be to give it
                    a special status which would insure its independence of judgement, like the
                    Federal Reserve. In real life they would probably have to be part of the White
                    House, although it would be critically important to insulate them as much as
                    possible from political and departmental pressures. Even State's Policy Planning
                    Staff could serve the purpose under the right leadership, assuming a willingness
                    by Presidents and Secretaries of State to use them wisely.</p>
                <p>As a practical matter it is, of course, quite unlikely that any of this will come
                    to pass.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would implementation be organized?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0390" n="Page0390"/>
                <p>JAEGER: Eisenhower created the Operations Coordinating Board to implement NSC
                    decisions. A separate interdepartmental mechanism to coordinate implementation
                    of policy along these lines would clearly be necessary. The National Security
                    Advisor's role, heading a much reduced, high-quality NSC staff, might be to make
                    sure that that the pace and quality of implementation met policy needs. In
                    short, he or she would be the bridge between our definition of national ends and
                    how we get there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's a creative set of ideas. How would all this
                        affect State and the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: I think it would simplify the process. Nothing dramatic would change on
                    the reporting side, although I think making reporting more concise and
                    quantitatively reduced would help a lot. State would be, as it is to a large
                    extent already, the diplomatic implementing agency. It would translate national
                    policy goals into more specific objectives aimed at regions and countries, and
                    make sure that progress is made.</p>
                <p>The great difference from the situation prevailing today would be that our
                    national interests and the ends of policy would to a much greater degree
                    correspond to the realities facing us, rather than distorting the picture by
                    giving overriding priority to ideologically or politically determined ends, or
                    focusing on one problem, i.e. the Middle East, at the expense of the rest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there are better ways to do foreign policy than
                        following popular predilections?</hi>

                <p>JAEGER: That's what de Tocqueville argued, and I think he was right. I have
                    always thought that the methodology developed by some members of the Acheson
                    Policy Planning staff was the key for not straying off the road. The notion of
                    starting with the definition of national ends and then examining the
                    appropriateness of means is, I think, the only sound way of hewing realistically
                    to the challenges which are really out there. Much, of course, depends on the
                    capacity, scope and wisdom of the planners and of the willingness of their
                    masters to listen to their advice. In this regard the Truman-Acheson
                    relationship too sets the example, though it was not always perfect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what you are really saying is that there is a major
                        correlation between how we organize foreign policy-making and our ability to
                        deal with the whole range of challenges facing us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: Exactly. The current system is haphazard and flawed. It neither defines
                    our national problems dispassionately, nor correlates implementation
                    accordingly, as reflected in the disproportionate role currently played by our
                    military. In a dramatically changed world facing enormous new collective
                    problems, we need ingoing reform.</p>

                <p>11. Summing up: The key is Education!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the end of this long and fascinating discussion let me
                        ask this: Looking back on your career was it worth while, would you do it
                        over again and what do you think is needed most to provide this country with
                        first-rate people managing our foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JAEGER: On the first two questions an unqualified 'yes'. It was an enormously
                    rewarding experience to play a small part in our successful operation of
                    containing the Soviet Union. We really were the 'city on the hill' confronting a
                    deeply flawed, dictatorial system whose destructive ideology, if imposed in
                    Europe and elsewhere, would have made for a very somber world.</p>
                <p>Revisionists argue that we could have reached a modus vivendi with the USSR. We
                    certainly did make major progress on arms control. Even so, it was a system held
                    together by fear, fear of military force, torture and deportation, which only
                    collapsed when Gorbachev refused to use force to continue to hold it together,
                    as had been done in Hungary and Czechoslovakia in earlier times. Containment
                    took forty-some years to bring Moscow to this point. It was an enormous success,
                    not only because we won, but because we won without using major force and
                    wide-spread war and destruction.</p>
                <p>As to what we need to do to provide America with “a sufficiency of men (or women)
                    to meet the problems of the day”, as Burt Marshall was apt to say, the answer, I
                    think is much better and much deeper education.</p>
                <p>I sometimes told students in recent years that diplomacy is so terribly important
                    because it's about blood, it's about human blood. You make little decisions in
                    meetings, you give advice in memoranda and in telegrams, you give or deny a
                    visa. If the decisions are wrong, somebody pays for it with their property,
                    their freedom or, in some cases, their lives. Of course, you walk away and go to
                    lunch. In the short term you are untouchable. But the moral responsibility of
                    dealing unsoundly with major and even minor international issues, is very
                    large.</p>
                <p>To get it right, our schools, at every level, need to teach history, not just the
                    flag-waving kind, but the starker reality: That nations and civilizations rise
                    and fail, usually because of their own short-sighted behavior; that failure
                    isn't pretty; and that carrying on at others' expense, as we did during slavery
                    and the extermination of our Indians, is really worse. We are still doing it
                    today, for instance, by keeping agricultural prices up and disadvantaging
                    cheaper producers in some of the poorest countries of the world.</p>
                <p>So our students need to learn from the past, a discipline our schools have
                    watered down almost to extinction.</p>
                <pb facs="0392" n="Page0392"/>
                <p>They must also regain a moral compass by reflecting on philosophy and religion
                    and the whole meaning of life; since the unjustified use of force, most recently
                    in Iraq, abuse and resort to torture, or our broad indifference to the suffering
                    of the world's poor and underprivileged, can only be put in correct perspective
                    if students are taught to recognize the value and dignity of all human life - an
                    idea which was still central to our founding fathers when they asserted that
                    “..all men were created equal..”.</p>
                <p>Lastly, there is a lack of rigor, almost an epidemic of frequent sloppy thinking.
                    We are moving into harder times, where global warming and its related crises
                    will require us to tighten belts and be much sturdier than has been necessary
                    recently. Whether this and future generations will meet that test remains to be
                    seen, but will determine whether we and the rest of the world will succeed or
                    fail. The stakes are very high.</p>
