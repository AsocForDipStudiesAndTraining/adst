                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Don Leidel interviewing Ambassador William B.
                        Schwartz, Jr., on April 22, 1995, at Longboat Key, Sarasota, Florida.
                        Ambassador Schwartz was the U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas from 1977 to
                        1981. Could you begin, Ambassador Schwartz, by giving us a bit of your
                        personal background and indicating how you came to be appointed
                        Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHWARTZ: I was born in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1921, and spent my life there. I
                    went to public high school there and attended the University of North Carolina.
                    Following that, in 1942, I entered the United States Navy during World War II
                    and served until 1946, at which time I returned to Atlanta and went into
                    business for a company called National Service Industries. Today, this company
                    is known as the New York Stock Exchange company. I spent my major business
                    career with them, until 1968, when due to some severe health problems I took
                    early retirement.</p>
                <p>I had been interested in affairs in Atlanta and in our state and got to know
                    President Carter when he was running for Governor of Georgia. I became
                    interested in him and devoted some time and effort to helping him when he was
                    running for the governorship. Later, when he made the decision to bid for the
                    Presidency of the United States, the first meeting that was ever held (he
                    actually was still in the governorship) to raise some seed money for him was
                    held in my backyard in Atlanta, Georgia. We had a handful of people who were
                    surprised to hear Carter say he was running for the Presidency. At that time, he
                    had been appointed to the Democratic Committee for Reelection (or something of
                    that name). He was traveling around the country helping other Democrats in their
                    reelection campaigns. We raised some seed money for him to do some traveling in
                    his exploration for the Presidency.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>In any event, I did help him when he ran for the Presidency, and — I laugh about
                    it — when people ask me how I happened to be appointed, I tell them President
                    Carter was looking for the best man he could find, so he called on me to go to
                    the Bahamas. Of course, my association with him and with people close to him
                    obviously influenced my being asked to go to the Bahamas. But I was totally
                    surprised. I hadn't asked for it, didn't expect it, didn't want anything,
                    frankly. In April of 1977, after he was already in the White House, I was at our
                    winter home in Longboat Key when I got a telephone call from the White House and
                    President Carter asked me to accept the Ambassadorship to the Bahamas. This came
                    as a total, complete surprise. But I did; that's the story of how I was
                    appointed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in April of 1977...and when did you go to the
                        Bahamas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHWARTZ: Well, that's interesting. If I may deviate for a moment, the Bahamas
                    had had an interim ambassador who had been appointed under the previous
                    Administration. He had left the Bahamas. I guess it was back in December of
                    1976. When I was appointed, there was no ambassador there. The deputy chief of
                    mission was acting as ambassador. I was asked to go in April, but my
                    confirmation didn't take place until September. So the Bahamas was actually
                    without an ambassador until I went there in October of 1977. The best I can
                    recall without my notes, we went there on October the eighth of 1977.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The confirmation was probably delayed by the summer
                        recess, I would guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHWARTZ: Yes, that was it. The confirmation was delayed by the summer recess. I
                    am told there wasn't any problem with my personal credentials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do between April and October? Did you spend
                        time in the State Department, in briefings and taking courses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHWARTZ: Ambassador Leidel, I was very fortunate. I did go to Washington on
                    several occasions at the request of the State Department for some briefings. But
                    I suppose the most fortunate thing that happened was that the present Prime
                    Minister, Peng Li, had had a previously scheduled personal appointment and
                    meeting with President Carter. It was scheduled for possibly July or August of
                    1977. He was going to Washington to meet with President Carter, and the
                    President asked me to be on hand for that meeting. So I actually had an
                    opportunity to meet Prime Minister Peng Li and his Foreign Minister in
                    Washington prior to my actual confirmation as ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go through a series of briefings through the
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SCHWARTZ: I did. I had several briefings with the Department. I actually had a
                    two-day seminar with several other pending ambassadors to learn some of the
                    ropes of what they expected of ambassadors. Mrs. Schwartz went with me on that
                    occasion, and she spent a few hours getting some briefings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you satisfied, generally, with your preparation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHWARTZ: A number of years after the fact, I have to say to you, and I don't
                    mean this at all by way of criticism, that frankly there was a good deal lacking
                    as far as information concerning what to expect and about personal
                    record-keeping. But that's all been changed since then, I am told, on the
                    recommendation of several people who went through and had some experiences where
                    they felt the State Department might possibly give better information. I don't
                    mean that as criticism, because my understanding is that today they do an
                    excellent job. But we didn't get much specific information as to the kinds of
                    things we could look forward to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you summarize, when you arrived in the Bahamas in
                        October, what you considered to be the major issues, the crux of what you
                        recall as being significant in terms of U.S. relations with the Bahamas, in
                        terms of your role, your relationship with the leadership in the
                        Bahamas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHWARTZ: Well, this is 1995, and I went to the Bahamas in 1977. So, that's 18
                    years, and I'm 73 years old, and I'm trusting to memory. Suffice it to say that
                    the Bahamas was not a critical country as far as relations with the United
                    States was concerned. It wasn't the Middle East, and we didn't have any major
                    problems, thank goodness.</p>
                <p>The Bahamas, though geographically close to the United States, is a foreign
                    country. The Bahamas had been left without a U.S. ambassador, as I mentioned
                    earlier, for almost a year. The government of the Bahamas was a Black government
                    who had come into power several years prior to that and were proud, as they had
                    a right to be. They were anxious to stand on their own, but at the same time be
                    recognized by the United States as a foreign government due the same attention
                    and respect as any other government.</p>
                <p>I found my reception to be an extremely cordial one. I think, to a great extent,
                    that was spearheaded by the fact that I was able to meet with Prime Minister
                    Peng Li and his Foreign Minister and the Bahamian Ambassador to the United
                    States prior to my going there.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>The drug problem was an intense one for the United States. The Bahamas was a
                    gateway for drugs. I suppose one of the major things that our government was
                    interested in was attempting to decrease the flow of drugs through the Bahamas
                    into the United States. The Bahamians were interested in seeing tourism, which
                    is their major industry, continue, and were interested in promoting that and in
                    seeing the United States recognize that and help in any way possible.</p>
                <p>We didn't have any major critical issues at the time that I went there. I arrived
                    in the Bahamas October eighth or ninth and had the good fortune of meeting Queen
                    Elizabeth and Prince Philip four or five days after that on an official visit of
                    theirs. I was thrown into that. Fortunately, I had already presented my
                    credentials to the Governor General, and that was the takeoff for my experience
                    in the Bahamas. It was a wonderful experience. The Queen was there for several
                    days, and she also came a year or two later for the celebration of the
                    Bahamians' Bicentennial. But that was the kick-off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you characterize the relations between the Bahamian
                        Government and the U.S. Government as positive and cooperative? Were there
                        problem areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHWARTZ: No, they really were positive and cooperative. There was some
                    reluctance on the part of the Bahamian Government to being told by the United
                    States that it wanted this done or that done. This was true in the drug
                    enforcement area. When I first went there, we had no DEA office. An agent from
                    Miami who would come over periodically. It was during my tour of duty there that
                    we established a DEA office, which took some doing and convincing. The Bahamians
                    didn't want the United States imposing upon them restrictions and requirements
                    without not only their consent, but almost without Bahamian participation in it.
                    They didn't want to be taken for granted. But the relationship between the two
                    governments has been excellent, and I think remains so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any other areas that you would care to comment
                        on in terms of relations with the host government or its leaders or
                        personalities that you recall that would be of special significance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHWARTZ: You may recall that Vesco was in the Bahamas for quite some period of
                    time. He was Persona Non Grata in the United States. He was there while I was
                    there. The Shah of Iran was also there while I was there. Both of these
                    situations required some hand-holding and some soft gloves with the Bahamian
                    Government. But there were no major incidents involving either person. We didn't
                    have any major crisis while I was there. I joke about it and tell people that I
                    kept us out of war during the period I was there. But we had cordial relations
                    and it was, obviously, a fabulous experience for me.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>The Bahamian people respect the United States, and yet they want the United
                    States to understand that they are a country unto themselves, that their
                    proximity to the United States doesn't mean that they are part of the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Schwartz, would you care to comment on the
                        Embassy staff supporting you, in terms of their own qualifications,
                        cooperation, whether they were State Department or DEA? Did you feel that
                        you had adequate support? Were there any special problems? Also, how did you
                        feel morale was at the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHWARTZ: Well, first of all, I would say this. You know there's been a
                    tremendous amount of conversation over the years, and there still is, about
                    career ambassadors versus non-career, pros and cons, the attitude of the career
                    Foreign Service personnel toward non-career ambassadors. I must say that the
                    staff in the Bahamas was extremely cooperative. I found them well qualified and
                    happy. The Bahamas was a lovely spot to be. It wasn't all sun and roses, but at
                    the same time for many of the staff who had come from other locations, it was
                    quite a wonderful change. The staff was fine, and the reception of the staff was
                    fine.</p>
                <p>The DCM who was there when I arrived, Rush Taylor, couldn't have been of more
                    help to me. He was due to leave shortly after I arrived. When he left, Terry
                    Shankle became my DCM. Terry recently passed away, but he was, just prior to his
                    death, head of the Foreign Service Association. That shows the respect with
                    which he was held by his peers.</p>
                <p>The staff was fine. The Bahamian staff was excellent. I really don't have any
                    complaints at all. We did have a very large Customs contingency, because we have
                    a pre-clearance unit in Nassau and also in Freeport. Consequently, the Customs
                    people had a large staff. They were good. I didn't have any complaints at
                    all.</p>
                <p>Coming out of a business environment, sometimes I did feel our Government was a
                    little “fat,” so to speak, in how the accounts were done, personnel-wise. It's a
                    little difficult oftentimes, to get answers from the State Department in
                    Washington. I suppose that's to be expected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall roughly how many people were in the Embassy,
                        both Americans and Foreign Nationals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHWARTZ: I think we had somewhere in the area of 28 or 30 when I went there, not
                    including the pre-clearance unit of Customs, which was a large contingent. That
                    did not include the Marine contingent, either. It's since grown, I am told. I've
                    been back to the Bahamas on many occasions, and I did at one point keep in
                    pretty good contact with them. I understand the staff has grown
                    considerably.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any Congressional visitors while you were
                        there? Was there any special Congressional interest in the aspect of
                        relations with the Bahamas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHWARTZ: We had a couple of Congressional groups come in. We had helped the
                    Bahamians with an agricultural experiment at Andros Island, one of the outer
                    islands. We had a couple of groups come in who were interested in that. Senator
                    Claiborne Pell used to visit the Bahamas with a little regularity because he had
                    some family who were there. And we had several others, but there were no major
                    situations that I can remember. I know we had a number of visitors, but I don't
                    think they were on official business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any special relation of interest with U.S. press
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHWARTZ: Of course, the media was always interested in the Vesco situation and
                    the Shah situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Schwartz, could you summarize what you consider
                        your greatest accomplishments, frustrations, disappointments during your
                        tenure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHWARTZ: Well, I suppose one of my greatest accomplishments was establishing a
                    DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) office in the Bahamas, and the results that were
                    obtained from it. You may recall that drugs and addiction, the flow of drugs
                    into the United States, was a tremendous problem then. It still is today, but it
                    was even worse then. The Bahamas was the launching pad for the entry of drugs
                    into this country, because of the many outer islands that the Bahamas have which
                    make it so easy for small planes to land on and transfer contraband to boats
                    that could come on into the coast of Florida. Through the cooperation of the
                    Bahamian Government, and through our own efforts, the DEA Office was finally
                    obtained, and it really did a great job in stemming the flow of drugs. That was
                    a great accomplishment.</p>
                <p>I might comment that after the Carter Administration left, the Reagan
                    Administration, through its Vice President at that time, George Bush , the DEA
                    office in our Embassy in the Bahamas, was made much larger. President Reagan
                    gave Vice President Bush the responsibility, you may recall, of handling the
                    drug problem, and he did a great job with it.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Another thing that was done, frankly, was to mend the relationship between our
                    Government and the Bahamian Government. Although there weren't any severe
                    problems when I went there in October 1977, the Bahamian Government had been
                    without an American Ambassador for over a year. They felt like second-class
                    citizens. When they finally did get an ambassador, and I was able to have a very
                    close, personal relationship with the top people in the Bahamian Government, I
                    think that created a far better atmosphere, which led us to get the cooperation
                    of the Bahamian Government in the DEA situation and also in some other problems.
                    The fact that the Shah of Iran was allowed to go to the Bahamas was a result of
                    our Government being able to call upon the Bahamian Government. We had to help
                    find a haven for the Shah and his party, and as a result of our good relations
                    with the Government of the Bahamas, we were able to do so.</p>
                <p>Frustrations and disappointments were minimal. I suppose the greatest frustration
                    was, coming out of a business environment, for me to have to go through the
                    bureaucracy of our State Department to get results, get things done and to get
                    answers to questions that in my judgment took longer to accomplish than it
                    should have. That's our system. I'm not critical of it, but it was
                    frustrating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else you care to add, Ambassador Schwartz?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHWARTZ: I don't think so. It obviously was a tremendous personal satisfaction
                    for me to be able to serve our country. Even though the Bahamian Government is
                    not a crisis situation, we do have an ongoing relationship with them. They are
                    an important partner of ours; they are close to this country; they represent an
                    extremely critical area. We maintain military activities and bases in the
                    Bahamas. I considered it an honor and a privilege to serve, and I appreciate
                    what our Foreign Service does for our country far more today than I did before.
                    I admire the career people. They are self-sacrificing and they do us a lot of
                    credit. It was an honor for me and Mrs. Schwartz to be there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you very much, Ambassador Schwartz.</hi>
