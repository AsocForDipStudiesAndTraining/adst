                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Allen, I'm going to go back prior to your association with
                        USIA to get a little fill-in on who you are and where you came from and what
                        your education was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Bio Sketch</p>
                <p>HANSEN: I was born in a small town in New Jersey and went into the Navy when I
                    was 18 years old, in World War II, and stayed in for three and a half years.
                    When I came out of the Navy I went to Syracuse University, graduated with a B.A.
                    in Political Science, and became a newspaper reporter. Then when the Korean War
                    came along, I got called back into the Navy. When I got out, I was discharged as
                    a Lieutenant (j.g.) in naval intelligence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you spend your time during the Korean War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Actually, aboard ship in the Atlantic, and then in the Naval Intelligence
                    School in Washington before being assigned to intelligence duties in the
                    Washington area. I always thought it was ironic that having been in the
                    intelligence field, where, as we all know, one collects information, I ended up
                    in a career with USIA, an organization that does the opposite by giving away
                    information.</p>
                <p>Circumstances Leading to Employment With USIA</p>
                <p>The way that came about, I attended a FLEA luncheon in Washington, D.C. a few
                    months before I was about to be discharged from the Navy. FLEA, in this
                    instance, stands for “Federal Law Enforcement Agencies.” At that luncheon I
                    learned that one of my colleagues had been with USIA before being recalled to
                    active duty in the navy during the Korean War. This was in the summer of 1954.
                    The junior officer training program was being initiated by USIA which was,
                    itself, new. I knew absolutely nothing about the USIA but began to explore what
                    it was all about. Eventually I was accepted as one of the nine persons selected
                    to participate in the second junior officer training class which consisted of
                    six men and three women.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see there's an article about you as USIA's most senior
                        JOT. (USIA World, October 1987) Do you want to make some comments about
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: It should be “ex-JOT,” obviously. The reason for that article was that I
                    was the most senior ex-JOT on active duty when that article was written, just
                    before I retired. I had been in the second JOT class of the agency, and all of
                    those who had been in the first class—there were, I believe, seven in the first
                    class—as well as all of the others in my class had left the Agency. I was the
                    only one of those first two groups who was still on active duty (until I retired
                    in July of 1987).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's quite a change. Can you recall what was involved in
                        your training and how long was the training at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: The training was almost as it is today, a few months in Washington, with
                    some people going to language school afterwards and approximately nine months
                    overseas in a training position, where the attempt was made to learn the various
                    jobs of a typical USIS post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was practical training more than a kind of book or
                        seminar training, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes. Except for the two months in Washington, it was on-the-job
                    training.</p>
                <p>Initial Junior Officer Trainee Assignment to Caracas</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see you were assigned originally to USIS Caracas. That
                        was your first overseas assignment as a trainee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ask to go to Latin America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: No. Actually, when I got out of the Navy, I had gone to Europe and had
                    gotten a job in Madrid with Brown-Raymond-Walsh, the prime contractors building
                    the Spanish-American airbases. I thought that surely after three months in
                    Madrid, where I had worked before returning to Washington to be paneled for the
                    JOT job, USIA would send me right back there as by then I considered myself
                    somewhat of an expert on Spain. Much to my surprise, they sent me to Caracas. I
                    had no idea at the time where Caracas was, but I soon found out.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have Spanish at that time when you came into the
                        agency, or did they give you Spanish training.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: No. I had studied Spanish a little bit in college and had traveled a bit
                    in Mexico and studied Spanish on my own when I was in Madrid and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went in with some language background. Did you take
                        a language test during your training period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I don't believe so, but later on I took a language test and by that time
                    I had served in so many Spanish-speaking countries that I was able to get along
                    fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your biographical notes indicate that by 1956 you had
                        completed your training and you were married. Your bride was from Latin
                        America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: She was from the island of Trinidad, actually, but I met her in Caracas.
                    In those days, when an officer got married to a non-American, the officer had to
                    resign, which I did. Fortunately, my resignation was not accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they require in those days that a foreign-born wife
                        move toward taking of citizenship? What was the process at that time in
                        1956?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: They encouraged a foreign-born wife to become an American citizen. I
                    don't think it was compulsory, but in my case, my wife wanted to become an
                    American citizen, and I also wanted her to become a citizen. What was made
                    possible was that we didn't have to wait the usual five years. So as soon as we
                    got home, on home leave, we arranged it, and she became an American citizen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting to make these points, because the law and
                        the situation changes from time to time in the history of the agency about
                        the requirements of foreign-born wives and the requirements about
                        retirement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: It certainly has.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were assigned to Mexico. Can you tell us anything
                        about Mexico, your role in Mexico at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: First, let me say a little bit about Caracas. In those days there were
                    only three USIS officers at that post and I, as a JOT, was the fourth. Among
                    other things, there was so much that I didn't know, but in a few months I had to
                    be the acting information officer, so I learned fast. Harry Kendall, who had
                    been the information officer, left on transfer, and Bob Amerson, who was new to
                    the agency at the time, was coming to replace him, but there was a two-month
                    lapse. So with that experience and other things, by the time I arrived in Mexico
                    after a year-and-a-half in Caracas, I had begun to learn a little bit about the
                    work of the agency.</p>
                <p>Assignment to USIS/Mexico</p>
                <p>I went to Mexico as publications and distribution officer. We were doing a lot of
                    printing for Central American USIS posts in those days. The USIS Mexico
                    publication and distribution unit, which I was in charge of, had about 25
                    employees at the time. Much later this unit became the agency's Regional Service
                    Center for Latin America and was completely detached from USIS Mexico, but at
                    that time it was an integral part of USIS. While in Mexico I was asked at
                    various times to fill in as the Executive Officer when that individual went on
                    leave; as Radio and TV Officer; and as Motion Picture Officer. Thus in the year
                    and a half that I was in Mexico I received some well-rounded experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let us go back. Tell us a little about life in Venezuela,
                        particularly in Caracas, and then let's move on and do the same thing about
                        Mexico City. Is this when Caracas was still undeveloped, or was this after
                        it moved on to become really a very powerful hub?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Caracas, though the capital of Venezuela, was very underdeveloped at that
                    time. It was almost like a cow town although it had a population of about one
                    million. Today it's well over five million. In those days, perhaps five million
                    was the total population of all of Venezuela. The president at the time was
                    Perez Jimenez, a military dictator. Just by coincidence, as my wife and I were
                    en route from Mexico to British Guiana (the post we went to after Mexico), and
                    had stopped off in Caracas, it was the weekend that Perez Jimenez—or “P.J.” as
                    he was universally referred to—was overthrown. That was quite an exciting
                    time.One of the things we were doing in Venezuela when I was stationed there was
                    pushing Eisenhower's “Atoms for Peace” project. I recall our press chief—who was
                    an Argentine who had to leave Argentina during the Peron era and had ended up in
                    Caracas—was a very capable fellow who would take a story like the Atoms for
                    Peace project and find some reference to Venezuela buried in the story. He would
                    highlight that fact, giving the whole story a local angle, and with it we would
                    hit the front pages of all major dailies in Caracas. That was the kind of thing
                    we were capable of doing.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>At the same time, television was just coming to Caracas. George Butler, who was
                    the PAO, had been with CBS earlier. He was very much into TV. He started an
                    educational program on television with a local radio commentator (under contract
                    with USIS) named Renny Ottolina. Ottolina later became “Mr. TV” in Venezuela
                    because of a daily, four-hour talk show he ran years later. He got his first TV
                    training, however, in USIS under George Butler's direction. I'm sure many others
                    in developing countries learned the communications business working for USIS,
                    but I doubt that few if anyone could match Ottolina's highly successful
                    television career. (He was to die later in a tragic plane crash at the height of
                    his career after getting involved in local politics.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you moved on to Mexico, you obviously were doing all
                        information-type work. What about Mexico in 1956-57? What about Mexico City?
                        Did you travel around? Tell us a little about Mexico.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Mexico, certainly in those days, also was in the underdeveloped category,
                    very much so, but Mexico City was then, as it is now, one of the largest cities
                    in the world. So there were sections of the city much more developed than what
                    one would find in Caracas. But the city problems of pollution and overpopulation
                    and slums and poverty and so forth were as prevalent there as they were in
                    Caracas., although more so.</p>
                <p>I remember we moved about five miles away from the center of the city after
                    living in Mexico City about six months in a downtown apartment, and after we had
                    moved, as I drove every morning to the Embassy, you could see this black cloud
                    in the center of the city. It was the handwriting in the sky, if you wish—a
                    warning of what was going to happen to Mexico City as time went on. The
                    pollution could only get worse, as it did. But because they had so many other
                    problems, they couldn't handle this one. They gave no priority to the pollution
                    problem. But they have suffered for it ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the traffic very serious at that point as it has
                        become subsequently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Well, in a way, it was more serious, because they have these large
                    “glorietas” (traffic circles) in Mexico City. You took your life in your hands
                    whenever you had to cross the street, so much so that at the time one of the
                    leading newspapers used to publish, on the front page, the names of people
                    killed in traffic accidents the day before. That usually numbered maybe 50 or

                <p>HANSEN: Actually, I was not directly involved with press operations. On the
                    motion picture side, we emphasized the cultural and education aspects of U. S.
                    society. In my role as publications and distribution officer, we also were doing
                    a lot in the cultural and educational fields, but also in explaining T. S.
                    policies. In that 18 months that I was in Mexico City I was not directly
                    involved with the day-to-day information activities and crises of the day. Even
                    our TV activities tended to be of the documentary type.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you travel around at all, or were you always primarily

                <p>Transfer to British Guiana</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were then directly transferred from Mexico to
                        Georgetown, British Guiana. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Well, one morning I received a letter signed by Frank Oram who was then
                    area director, informing me that I was to be transferred to Georgetown, British
                    Guiana; that there was great concern in Washington that “B.G.” might become “the
                    second Cuba.” This was a very challenging assignment for a young, relatively
                    inexperienced officer. There had been considerable discussion in Washington (I
                    learned later) as to whether or not they should send an officer as young and
                    inexperienced as I was at the time to that hot spot, but they decided to do so.
                    This was just before Christmas, so we were able to stay on in Mexico City for
                    Christmas and the New Year's, and then we left, my wife and I.</p>
                <p>It was on the way to Georgetown that we stopped off in Caracas for the weekend,
                    when, as I mentioned earlier, Perez Jimenez was leaving town, forced out by his
                    military colleagues.When we arrived in Georgetown, then, for the first time, I
                    truly knew what an underdeveloped country is. Georgetown is, we used to say, at
                    the end of the line, but then you go over to Dutch Guiana to the south, and you
                    think the same thing, and from there you go further south to French Guiana, and
                    that really is the end of the line!</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>But in any event, Georgetown is a place, we used to say, where you could be six
                    feet under and still breathing. The reason for this is that the town is about
                    five feet below sea level. The Dutch, when they ruled that section of the
                    Guianas, built dikes to keep out the sea while water from the tropical downpours
                    flows into Georgetown from the land side. If it's high tide, they can't open the
                    sluice gates to let the water out until the tide goes down. So the water sits
                    there after a heavy rainstorm until they can let the water run out a low tide.
                    Occasionally the sea wall breaks and the sea comes in anyway. Therefore, a lot
                    of buildings in British Guiana, in Georgetown and elsewhere along the coast, are
                    on stilts. Georgetown itself is interspersed with canals to drain the area.</p>
                <p>At the time of my assignment to Georgetown, President Eisenhower was in the White
                    House. There was great concern that British Guiana, which would soon get its
                    independence, would very possibly become a second Cuba (as mentioned earlier)
                    inasmuch as the prime minister at the time was Cheddi Jagan. Jagan, usually
                    described as a Marxist, was very friendly with the Cubans and the Soviets. His
                    leanings were certainly in the Communist direction. So the feeling in Washington
                    was that it was time to have a USIS office there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the first one to go in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I was the first American USIA officer to be stationed there. We did have
                    a library that had been set up by a Guianese employee under the direction of the
                    PAO in Trinidad. My job was a branch PAO, reporting to the PAO in Port-of-Spain,
                    Trinidad (who was Gar Routt at the time). Again (as in Mexico), I was there for
                    a year-and-a-half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it? What did you go through to open up a new post
                        in a place like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Left Leaning Cheddi Jagan Blocks American MovesTo Aid and Gain Influence in
                    Guiana</p>
                <p>HANSEN: The small library was, of course, our cultural center. The whole city had
                    only 100,000 population at the time, and there were about three newspapers that,
                    perhaps, we could do some business with. I made it a point to get to know the
                    newspaper editors and writers and political cartoonists.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The leading cartoonist in Georgetown and I became friends. I used to give him
                    ideas for some of his cartoons, which he would occasionally use. I always
                    thought that was a great thing from our point of view. Everyone was very
                    friendly, but the political situation was such that Cheddi Jagan and the Peoples
                    Progressive Party (PPP) were on one end, and the American consulate—we had a
                    consulate there at the time—was, in a sense, on the other. We tried to have an
                    AID program there. A few people from AID were assigned to B.G. but Cheddi Jagan
                    and his PPP were always attempting to keep the Americans from gaining influence,
                    so while the local government talked a lot about the need for more economic
                    assistance from the Americans and others, Prime Minister Jagan and the PPP
                    managed to keep the AID program small while putting up road blocks with regard
                    to the few AID programs that were initiated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't find any problems being an American, even
                        though there were Communist leanings? Or did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: No, I really didn't find any problem. As a matter of fact, there was a
                    young man named Ranji Chandisingh who was one of Cheddi Jagan's lieutenants and
                    the editor of the PPP newspaper, Thunder. We became friendly enough for him to
                    invite me to his home one day to try some East Indian cooking which his mother
                    prepared. (Like many Guianese, he was of East Indian descent.) While we were
                    sociable we discussed our diametrically-opposed political views but each always
                    left through the same door by which he entered. British Guiana-Guyana as it is
                    know today—is known as the “Land of Six Peoples.” The major ethnic group is of
                    African descent; next are the East Indians who arrived from India to be
                    indentured laborers; then the Portuguese—they distinguish them as a group; and
                    the Chinese and the Amerindians—so-called to distinguish the indigenous Indians
                    from the East Indians. The sixth and smallest minority, about one percent or
                    less of the population, was the Caucasian group.</p>
                <p>Effectiveness of Marian Anderson Film</p>
                <p>Shortly after I had arrived in Georgetown the agency had obtained a film—perhaps
                    it was a USIA film—of the trip to India of the renowned black American singer,
                    Marian Anderson. I thought: what a marvelous way to introduce myself to the
                    community if we could show that film in the USIS library! While racial problems
                    existed, of course, between blacks and whites, the big problem in Guiana was
                    between the blacks and the East Indians (mainly because they were an economic
                    threat to each other—or so they thought—being the two major local groups in
                    size). So here, in an hour-long documentary, was Marian Anderson, an American
                    black, who takes this marvelous trip through India to perform for the Indians!
                    So we set that up and invited Prime Minister Jagan and his American-born wife,
                    Janet Jagan, along with other local notables to the grand opening of the new
                    USIS office. Cheddi Jagan didn't come but his wife, Janet, who was Minister of
                    Labor in the Jagan government, did. The film was a big hit. So much so, that for
                    the next year or two the B.G. Government Information Services borrowed a copy
                    and showed it all over the country.</p>

                <p>HANSEN: Yes, English. We always joked, however, that there are at least three

                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I think that our cultural and educational influence was what was most
                    lasting, and most important, really, because Georgetown, which is the only city
                    in Guyana, is so isolated from the rest of the world. In those days, they were
                    isolating themselves even further by ignoring or turning off any economic
                    assistance from the United States, and turning, as Cheddi Jagan and his Peoples
                    Progressive Party were doing, to Cuban and Soviet influence.</p>
                <p>Jagan Loses Power After Independence</p>
                <p>The upshot of that, however, was that Cheddi Jagan never retained power after
                    independence was declared. A black politician, Forbes Burnham, who had been
                    Jagan's deputy years before, ran against him, and by hook or crook—and I use the
                    term advisedly—took over the government when British Guiana became independent.
                    Burnham stayed in power for about 20 years, until one day he had to have a
                    throat operation. As I understand it, he had a Cuban surgeon work on his throat
                    in 1985 and he didn't survive.</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes. But the sad commentary is that the U.S. in those days was trying to
                    convince the British that B.G. was a great danger to the western world if it
                    became a second Cuba. The British were inclined to think, “Well, Jagan's a
                    nationalist.” They were much less concerned. But I think the American point of
                    view won out. The U. S. Government devoted considerable resources—USIS is just a
                    small reflection of this, by instituting more AID programs later and no doubt
                    the other agency was involved down there. But the end result is that Guyana
                    today is probably just as poor as it was in those days. My feeling at this point
                    is that I think that if we had kept out of it, they might have been better off,
                    and U.S. interests would not have been seriously affected. Of course, we have no
                    way of knowing. (Note: In January 1989, the Washington Post reported that
                    “despite the long years of hardship and discontent, the ruling socialists have
                    won every general election since 1964. “Jagan's American-born wife, Janet, is
                    also in politics. Her explanation of PNC's 25 years of electoral success is
                    widely shared both at home and abroad. Since they were catapulted into office,
                    we have had one rigged election after another, she said.” Her husband Cheddi
                    Jagan, still active as the major opposition all these years, joined forces in
                    1988 with three other opposition parties in the “Patriotic Coalition for
                    Democracy” to try to unseat Burnham's successor, President Desmond Hoyte who was
                    allegedly trying to open Guyana to foreign capital. The small, still
                    impoverished country remained in 1989 with a $1.2 billion debt.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went on from British Guiana in 1959 to Madrid, where
                        you were ACAO in charge of the new textbook translation program and,
                        obviously, some other cultural duties. What about this assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Madrid</p>
                <p>HANSEN: That was rather interesting in the beginning. There existed about
                    $500,000 (equivalent in Spanish pesetas), which was a considerable sum of money
                    in those days, in a fund for a new textbook translation program. These were PL
                    480 funds that we could use. No one had found the time to make use of these
                    funds, so they established a new position and I suppose that having been at this
                    hardship post in Georgetown for 18 months, they knew Madrid would be a nice
                    place to which to transfer me.</p>
                <p>Ups and Downs of Book Translation Program in Spain</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>So I went there to run this program. The idea was that it was to be a five year
                    program—$100,000 per year. But in the first year there was a devaluation of the
                    Spanish peseta. Overnight the $100,000 was reduced to $65,000 (equivalent).
                    Nevertheless, I went down to Barcelona, which then, as now, is the publishing
                    center of Spain, if not the entire Spanish-speaking world, with this $65,000 in
                    my pocket, so to speak, and made arrangements with various local publishers to
                    translate and publish American textbooks. In the first year of the program we
                    made contracts to publish 43 titles, which I thought was pretty good, and I
                    think everybody else did.</p>
                <p>But then, the following year, they decided that the remaining funds (originally
                    $400,000) would be used for other purposes. So the textbook program which had
                    begun so auspiciously abruptly ended.</p>
                <p>It is ironic that more than two decades later USIA established a regional book
                    office (for Latin America primarily) in Barcelona! I had strongly argued for
                    that at the time, using all kinds of evidence that we won't go into here, but
                    finally a book translation office was established in the publishing center of
                    the Spanish-speaking world. (Note: In 1987 the newly-established Regional Book
                    Office was closed except for one employee due to budgetary and other
                    considerations.)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Life in Madrid, then, was pleasant for you at that
                        particular time. How large a post was it? What about Spain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Spain was just marvelous in those days, and I've been back several times
                    since. It's still marvelous. But I had thought that in going there from
                    Georgetown, that this is going to be a piece of cake, because I'd been there
                    before and I would adjust easily. I did not realize that it would be so
                    different. When I was there before, I was a bachelor. Now I was coming back with
                    my wife, in fact, our three-month old son as well. When I look back, I think I
                    had a more difficult time adjusting back into the Spanish culture than I had in
                    any other country. For one thing, we had to adapt to Spanish hours whenever we
                    wanted to eat out, and you couldn't begin to eat dinner until 8:30 or 9:00 PM at
                    the earliest which was highly inconvenient with a baby in the family. When we
                    first arrived, we were living in an apartment that was cold, so on and so forth.
                    But eventually, of course, as in all posts, we adjusted and we settled down.
                    Then it was absolutely marvelous, that Spanish living.</p>
                <p>I had a lot of other duties as assistant cultural attach�, but there were at that
                    time three ACAOs. Jake Canter was the Cultural Attach� originally, and he was
                    replaced by Leopold Arnaud, former dean of the School of Architecture at
                    Columbia University. Both of them were delightful persons to work for.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Arnaud, then, was one of that big group of cultural
                        attach�s throughout the years who have come from academia or outside the

                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: This man—its a debatable thing. He certainly brought a lot of prestige to
                    the embassy and USIS. On the other hand, as far as the nitty-gritty was
                    concerned, that, of course, ended up being done by one of the ACAOs, Dick
                    Phillips in this case. Not the well-known Dick Phillips (during this era) of the

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And went on to the University of Pennsylvania. How did all
                        of that come about? You indicate that you were one of the early two to study
                        American culture and received an M.A. What about that situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>HANSEN: The agency at that time had initiated a program of advanced university
                    training for USIA officers in American studies. Barbara White was the first one
                    to go into that program. She went to Harvard. I merely applied. I knew I was
                    coming back to the states, and it was something I would like to do. Not very
                    many people applied, so I received the assignment. I came back, and everybody
                    thought I wanted to go to Harvard—and maybe I should have. But my mother was ill
                    at the time in New Jersey and I wanted to be closer to home. I also found, when
                    I went around and visited the University of Pennsylvania and a few other places,
                    that I could get a master's degree there in one year if I worked at it. (Harvard
                    and others required two years at the time.) Since Philadelphia is right next to
                    New Jersey, that worked out for my personal reasons. I received my master's in
                    that one year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You worked in American culture, rather than American
                        studies. What did that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: That's a good question. It means different things in different places.
                    The University of Pennsylvania “American Studies” program specializes in
                    American literature, whereas another American Studies program at another
                    university might specialize in American history, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were following through on literature. This is again
                        your interest in books and publishing and textbooks. This has followed you
                        certainly throughout this early part of your career. What did you do your
                        paper on for your master's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: My thesis was entitled Ugly, Quiet, and Real Americans. It was an
                    analysis of The Ugly American by Lederer and Burdick, The Quiet American by
                    Graham Greene, which takes place in Vietnam, as did The Ugly American, and the
                    real Americans were the Foreign Service officers which I analyzed using the
                    Biographic Register and other sources such as The Overseas Americans by Harlan
                    Cleveland.</p>
                <p>Caribbean Desk Officer</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Then I went back to Washington, and Hugh Ryan was area director at the time.
                    Again, there was concern about Guyana going communist, and Hugh Ryan knew that I
                    was one of the few specialists on Georgetown. He therefore assigned me the job
                    of Caribbean Desk Officer in order to utilize my expertise on the country that
                    had been “British Guiana” before independence. Shortly after my arrival in
                    Washington following my academic year in Philadelphia, he sent me to Georgetown
                    to see what we might do to beef up the post. I came back and recommended that we
                    double the size of the post—from one American officer to two. There was some
                    concern that since this wouldn't take a great deal of money, others in
                    government might think we were not being serious enough with regard to this
                    situation. However, I argued that given the size of Guiana, with a 100,000
                    population in the capital city and only 500,000 in the entire country, to put
                    more than two officers there would be overkill. For the next ten years or so we
                    probably had two officers there until the post reverted once again to a
                    one-person post, which is really all that such a small country requires in my
                    view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A major accomplishment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: And that's what we did. But during that time as Caribbean Desk Officer, a
                    most interesting thing to me was that the Dominican crisis broke.</p>
                <p>The Dominican Crisis and the USIS Role</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Dominican crisis? This is in 1965.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: 1965, right. Cuba again showed its hand. LBJ was president at the time,
                    and a civil war broke out in the Dominican Republic, sometime after the
                    assassination of their long-time military dictator there, Trujillo. It looked
                    like the people who represented the left, and were presumably supported by the
                    Cubans, if not the Soviets, were going to take over. The American government
                    decided that that was not to be and sent in some 22,000 troops to assure that
                    the country's leaders who wanted free elections would be able to hold them. Now,
                    every Latin American specialist knows that the worst thing, from a Latin
                    American point of view, that the U.S. can do is to intervene in another
                    country's affairs, especially military intervention. But we had to live with
                    that. As far as USIA was concerned, Hugh Ryan (Area Director Hewson Ryan) went
                    down with a task force of USIA officers to work on the internal and mammoth
                    external public affairs problems this situation caused.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean shortly after the troops landed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>HANSEN: This was maybe a few weeks after the troops landed. Because what
                    happened, there was a stalemate. The U.S., of course, could have just wiped out
                    the leftist revolutionaries, but that wasn't the idea. The idea was to try and
                    see if this country couldn't get back to a democratic form of government with
                    elections and so forth. The way the stalemate occurred was that the leftists
                    held the center of the capital, Santo Domingo, and the rest of the country,
                    practically, was in the hands of the people—some would say Rightists, but
                    certainly the non-revolutionists.So while that stalemate was occurring, the U.S.
                    sent a task force which included the USIA contingent, which tried to get the two
                    sides together and tried to get some kind of responsible local government going
                    that would be viable and where eventually elections could be held. One of the
                    major things that the U.S. Administration wanted to do was to turn this whole
                    mess over to the Organization of American States (OAS) as soon as possible.
                    Eventually that is what occurred. The American troops left as did the Americans
                    who were not assigned to the OAS or to the Embassy, and elections were
                    eventually held. I was involved somewhat in that which I'll explain later.
                    First, when I went down there for about three weeks during the fighting—I say
                    fighting, but it was mainly during the stalemate. But the bullets were still
                    flying between the lines, though the American troops tried to hold ground or
                    make limited advances without killing anyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the American troops doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: After they had landed, they protected those areas of the city that were
                    not in the hands of the rebel troops who were fighting against the established
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. Did you have evidence of Cuban intervention or
                        Russian intervention in the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: This was what the American government was saying, and I assume they had
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had no first-hand knowledge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I had no first-hand knowledge, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went down and worked with Hugh Ryan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>HANSEN: Darrell Carter, who was Hugh Ryan's deputy at the time, replaced Hugh
                    Ryan. As mentioned earlier, I was the Caribbean Desk Officer. When Darrell moved
                    up I became his deputy. But my main job during my temporary duty on the island
                    was one of working with the OAS information representative to attempt to locate
                    a usable radio station in the non-rebel zone that the OAS could take over as the
                    “Voice of the OAS.” Up until that time the 82nd Airborne Division, which had
                    come in along with the Psyops group, had established a temporary radio station.
                    That was the only radio station in the country that was operating, except for
                    the rebel station in downtown Santo Domingo in the area held by the rebels. All
                    the others were off the air. Eventually we found a suitable station. As soon as
                    the OAS started broadcasting from that station the Psyops group was able to
                    close down and left with the American troops, as did I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it working with the OAS, as a United States
                        Government official and the OAS as an institution? Were there any problems,
                        or did it all go pretty smoothly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: None at that time, and not on the working level, no problems at all. We
                    had the same objective. We wanted the OAS to really be responsible for this. We
                    thought they were the ones that should be—of course, that took the heat off of
                    the United States. Later on I got involved in what I called the “get out the
                    vote” campaign. The U.S. could not openly pursue (nor should it have) an
                    objective of getting any particular person to become president of the Dominican
                    Republic, but this was a country that had experienced so many years of military
                    dictatorship and was unaccustomed to democratic procedures. Furthermore, the
                    literacy rate was very low. There had to be some kind of education training in
                    the democratic processes so that Dominicans could learn what votes and elections
                    are all about. So one of the things we did, we devised some cartoon fashion,
                    very simple, about what you do when you vote and what happens when you vote, and
                    the importance of voting and so forth. This campaign was actually very
                    successful in the Dominican Republic. Some months later, an election was held,
                    and President Hector Garcia Godoy, who had been the provisional president prior
                    to elections, won. Based on the success in the “D.R” the same system was tried
                    in Vietnam but with far less success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the same use of cartoons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: The same use of cartoons and so forth with Vietnamese characters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think it was successful in the Dominican
                        Republic and not in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: The two situations were completely different. The Dominican Republic went
                    on to become a democratic government and was not invaded by a rebel army. Of
                    course, in Vietnam, North Vietnam eventually took over.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did the OAS continue to watch the situation very
                        closely?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: They did for a while, and then, of course, they dropped out of it, too,
                    and the country ran itself. An interesting sidelight is that 20 years later, I
                    was representing USIS in a country team meeting as deputy PAO in Pakistan during
                    the absence of the PAO, and Ambassador Spiers at the time, who is now Under
                    Secretary of State for Administration...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ronald Spiers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Ronald Spiers. He and most of his State Department colleagues were
                    absolutely upset, is a good word, I guess, the morning after the Grenada
                    invasion. I had been through this, in a sense, in the Dominican Republic. I'll
                    come back to this in a minute. But I said at that country team meeting in
                    Islamabad the morning after the Grenada “rescue mission,” “Why don't we just
                    wait and see, because 20 years ago, the U.S. and LBJ were so criticized for
                    sending troops into the Dominican Republic, and yet ever since then, the
                    Dominican Republic has been a democracy. And economically, while it may not be
                    doing so well, it's doing better than a lot of its neighbors.” Of course, what
                    happened in Grenada, at least from my point of view, is that it's a damn good
                    thing we went in. But that's another story.</p>
                <p>American Liberal Press Hurt USIS and OASE Efforts in Dominican Crisis</p>
                <p>At the time of the Dominican crisis, one of the most difficult things we had to
                    face as USIS officers is an antagonistic American liberal press. Members of the
                    press, the foreign correspondents, a lot of them—not all of them, would accept
                    as gospel truth anything that the rebel side said, or what they said on the
                    radio or later in briefings. But when the correspondents were getting briefings
                    from American officials or the military officials at the time, anything said was
                    suspect and was often reported as suspect.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's how it was in Vietnam, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes, sure. And then I remember, whether it was The New York Times or the
                    Washington Post, but anyway, in the American press, the view was that what LBJ
                    did by sending those 22,000 troops into Santo Domingo put American foreign
                    policy in Latin America back 40 years; that was the expression. It just so
                    happens it was the first time in 40 years that we sent troops into a Latin
                    American country.</p>

                <p>Well, less than two years later, President Johnson, in Punta del Este,
                    Uruguay—and I happened to be down there as press attach� of USIS Montevideo at
                    the time—met with every president of every single Latin American country, all of
                    whom attended that historic summit conference. (No such meeting had ever been
                    held before, and there hasn't been one since—at this writing.) So things aren't
                    as drastic as they sometimes are reported to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The presence of the American troops was not as badly
                        received among the Latin American countries as made out by the American
                        press, is that what you're saying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: No. At the time, it was received very badly by almost everyone, I think,
                    especially many Latin Americans. But the final result was not as bad as some of
                    the American press would have us believe at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With your year in Pennsylvania and then this assignment in
                        Washington, this was the first time you'd been home in eight years or so,
                        and you had a wife. Was she living in the United States for the first
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I imagine it was, except that it was just another new culture and it
                    wasn't all that difficult to adjust. We had two children by that time and a
                    third one came along.</p>
                <p>Anti-Terrorism</p>
                <p>HANSEN: Two unique foreign policy issues in which the agency played and continues
                    to play an important role are anti-terrorism and narcotics. I would like to make
                    a few comments about them. With regard to the former, anti-terrorism, I was
                    policy officer for Latin America in 1972 when terrorism was particularly rampant
                    in Latin America. It was difficult to get many of my fellow USIA officers
                    interested in this subject in those days, but a few of us believed that
                    terrorism in the modern world was something USIA should be concerned about as an
                    important foreign policy issue. I, therefore, pursued the subject more than some
                    of my colleagues, with the result that I was assigned to participate with others
                    in exploring what the U.S. Government might do about this growing
                    phenomenon.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I was the USIA representative on a task force which met at State and had among
                    its members a psychiatrist, since how hostages reacted during and after a
                    terrorist incident was of concern, and a CIA representative because of their
                    natural interest in this subject. I wrote a paper for this group which
                    essentially argued that USIA should not only include in its output information
                    which helped explain why international cooperation was essential to combat
                    terrorism, but also to discredit its use as a political weapon, and its users.
                    Furthermore, the publicity purpose of terrorist acts made it a subject of
                    special interest to USIA.</p>
                <p>But like population control and later, narcotics, there were some bureaucrats and
                    Foreign Service Officers who did not recognize—or did not want to recognize—that
                    USIA had an important role to play in supporting U.S. foreign policy in what
                    were, initially at least, somewhat esoteric fields. Eventually, of course, USIA
                    included all of these things among its priorities at one time or another.</p>
                <p>One sidelight on the terrorism issue. When it became an important enough subject
                    for the Department of State to create an office to deal with this phenomenon,
                    the office was referred to as the Office of Terrorism. I always thought that was
                    subject to misinterpretation, and always referred to it myself as the Office of
                    Anti-Terrorism. I was pleased to see that the State Department finally came
                    around much later to calling the office, much more appropriately, the Office of
                    Counterterrorism.</p>
                <p>USIA Produces Anti-Narcotics Film</p>
                <p>With respect to agency programs in narcotics, the first and possibly only film
                    the agency ever produced on this subject was one which the Latin American office
                    encouraged to be produced, because the issue was such an important one in Latin
                    America at the time. I'm talking about the Office of the Assistant Director of
                    USIA for Latin America as the office which urged that a USIA film should be
                    produced on this subject.</p>
                <p>The film was called “The Trip.” It's a case study of Colombia filmed by agency
                    film producer Ashley Hawkin. I spent many hours trying to convince Ashley that a
                    film on narcotics for Latin America was needed and could and should be produced.
                    He finally agreed that film treatment could be done by using one country as a
                    model. His wife is Colombian, and Colombia, of course, even today, remains,
                    unfortunately, a leading producer of illicit narcotics. This may have
                    facilitated his ability to obtain the cooperation of Colombian authorities,
                    which was, or course, needed to film in that country. In any event, the film was
                    shown widely in Latin American on television and by direct projection, and
                    Ashley rewarded me for my efforts by listing me as a technical advisor in the
                    credits.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Two things this film demonstrated that are important. First, any society which
                    gets involved in illicit international drug trafficking will sooner or later
                    involve its own citizenry. Illicit drug trafficking involving other countries
                    will unquestionably become, in due course, a major problem for the local
                    population. I saw this happen in my four years in Peru and in my three years in
                    Pakistan. Secondly, this problem must be dealt with in all of its
                    facets—education, policy enforcement, drug treatment and rehabilitation; all
                    must be used. This important point was also made in Ashley Hawkin's film.</p>
                <p>The narcotics problem, if anything, is worse today than it was when it first
                    became an international issue in the modern world, and only in 1988 have
                    Americans begun to accept the idea that users should receive stiffer punishment
                    than was the case heretofore. I think this is one of many needed efforts to
                    combat illicit drug trafficking. Because the problem is so complex, a film
                    dealing with this subject is extremely difficult to produce. As one film
                    producer who had reviewed many films on the narcotics problem, and had produced
                    a few himself, said in the early 1970s, “Some of the films produced about drugs
                    are worse than the drugs themselves.” In the early 1970s, when the issue became
                    hot for the American public, a number of films were produced domestically that
                    were either not accurate or, worse, encouraged rather than discouraged use of
                    illicit drugs. The scare tactics phase, for example, was used by some and simply
                    didn't work.</p>
                <p>Hansen Authors A Book on USIA</p>
                <p>Two final thoughts with regard to this interview. My book on USIA, entitled USIA,
                    Public Diplomacy in the Computer Age, was written entirely on my own time
                    without any agency encouragement, because I was interested in and believed in
                    the work of USIA. Upon my return from Peru in 1980, the only overseas assignment
                    offered to me was deputy PAO Islamabad, which, frankly, didn't interest me at
                    the time. So I came back to Washington and was temporarily assigned to the
                    Public Liaison and Congressional Relations Office, as it was known at that time.
                    In that capacity I spent part of a year in Washington, the rest as Chief of the
                    Latin American branch of the Office of Research. Both jobs gave me the
                    opportunity for researching some of the materials for my book.</p>
                <p>In 1981, the Islamabad job again came up, and this time my wife and I decided we
                    would go for it, which we did, a decision we have never regretted. It turned out
                    to be a marvelous experience for myself and my family, but not only that, it
                    provided me with the time I needed to further develop a few papers I had written
                    in Washington, and with the research I had undertaken there, to produce the
                    manuscript which became the first book to be published about the agency in 16
                    years. It was published in 1984.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Islamabad's isolation and the fact that it was a relatively quiet Islamic society
                    (despite the fact that the Pakistanis had burned down our embassy and destroyed
                    two of our cultural centers two years before) enabled me to use many weekends
                    and holidays to write my book. The week before leaving Washington for Islamabad,
                    I had received a phone call from Praeger Publishers in New York in response to
                    an outline I had sent them and the draft of the first few chapters. They were
                    enthused about the project and, in due course, sent me a contract for its
                    publication. It enjoyed two printings, and I am now, in agreement with the
                    publisher, writing a revised edition which is due to appear in 1989. (Note: The
                    manuscript for the second edition was completed in November, 1988; publication
                    of the new edition is scheduled for October 1989.)</p>
                <p>Finally, let me end this by saying that as I look back on my career of nearly 33
                    years as a Foreign Service Officer with USIA, having lived and worked in eight
                    countries, it was an exciting, satisfying, and generally enjoyable experience,
                    despite its frustrations and occasional difficult moments.</p>
                <p>(Note: Not discussed above are experiences as Press Attach� in Uruguay at the
                    time that Tupamaro terrorists were in the ascendancy and murdered, among others,
                    Embassy staffer Dan Mitrione; in Bolivia as PAO which inspired an article
                    entitled “No One Should Live Above Ten Thousand Feet,” dealing with the physical
                    and mental effects of altitude especially for those living two miles up in the
                    Bolivian capital, La Paz; as PAO in Peru and the time of the Peruvian transition
                    from 12 years of military dictatorship to a return to an elected president; when
                    cocaine production and its effects on the local population was growing; and when
                    USIS was able to nurture the construction of three new binational center
                    buildings in as many Peruvian cities; and as DPAO in Pakistan at the height of
                    the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan which resulted in some three million Afghan
                    refugees living among Pakistan's 85 million population, and at a time when
                    Pakistan became the major heroin supplier for the U.S. and other western
                    markets—which caused a heroin epidemic among the Pakistanis
                    themselves.)ANNEX</p>
                <p>The following is a copy of a memo I “unearthed” which I wrote thirty years ago
                    when USIA was considering eliminating the American position in Georgetown which
                    had just been established about two years earlier, in 1957, and which, as noted
                    in the above interview, I was the first USIA Officer to fill—a.c.h., Jan. 28,
                    1989. (I do not recall why it is described as Memo No. 2.” The “Mr. McKnight”
                    referred to is John McKnight. I was on home leave, and learning of the possible
                    demise of the post where I had spent the last 18 months, I dashed off the memo
                    in defense of maintaining an American officer there.)</p>

                <p>August 25, 1959</p>
                <p>Memo No. 2</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>To: Mr. McKnight</p>
                <p>From: A. Hansen</p>
                <p>Subject: USIS Georgetown</p>
                <p>In view of the pending decision as to whether or not to continue the BPAO
                    position in Georgetown, it should be worth reflecting upon what has been
                    accomplished there during the past year or so. This cannot be boiled down to one
                    page, but below are listed some of what might be considered accomplishments.
                    They are presented to assist in evaluating the necessity of continuing the APAO
                    Georgetown position.</p>
                <p>1. THUNDER, the PEOPLE'S PROGRESSIVE PARTY newspaper edited by Communist Ranji
                    Chandisingh, continually attacked the U.S. until 8 or 10 months ago. The BPAO
                    made the personal acquaintance of the editor, dined at his home, argued with him
                    on many points. On Tibet he was silent; on race relations he contended, in all
                    seriousness, that there is no racial prejudice in the Soviet Union. He admitted,
                    under pressure, that the “Red Carpet” treatment was given him during his
                    two-week visit to Moscow several year ago—that he could not judge the USSR
                    fairly based on such a visit. Whether or not we were able to change his basic
                    thinking I cannot say. His newspaper, however, has not reflected a single
                    anti-American article, except for one or two isolated and justified criticisms
                    about race relations during the past six to eight months.</p>
                <p>2. The film THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA, shown to leading intellectuals and
                    political leaders, including Janet JAGAN, so impressed the head of the B.G.
                    Government Information Services hat he asked to buy a copy of the film for
                    showing throughout the country, was presented with a copy on long-term loan, and
                    has been showing it ever since.</p>
                <p>3. The President of the B.G. Press Association, after viewing some USIS films,
                    including ALTHEA GIBSON, commenting on the scene in that film where Miss Gibson
                    receives a “Ticker-tape” parade, addressed the audience saying, in effect, “When
                    we see that happening in America we know that all of America is not Little Rock
                    and that segregation is on its way out.</p>
                <p>4. Before USIS began its daily press operation, servicing the four local dailies
                    on an individual basis, few USIS stories were used and these were mostly
                    plastics. Reuters predominated with its pointed barbs at the U.S. in telling
                    “our” story. As an example of the change, in September, articles and features,
                    35 photos, and 18 anti-communist) cartoons printed in the local press—during the
                    month of September alone!</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>5. The Guiana graphic, a tabloid with the largest circulation, never used to
                    touch USIS materials. During the past year they published dozens of IPS photos
                    concerning achievements of American Negroes; “COMRADES”; U.S. scientific
                    achievements; and all USIS releases written locally. When the GRAPHIC damned the
                    U.S. editorially for alleged mistreatment of Guianese farm workers, the true
                    facts were dug up by USIS, the Labor Commissioner's cooperation was sought and
                    obtained and the U.S. and its farm labor program were completely vindicated in a
                    GRAPHIC editorial. Other criticism of the program ceased entirely.</p>
                <p>6. The British Guiana Legislature passed a resolution condemning the death
                    sentence of a Negro in Alabama accused of attempted rape of an elderly white
                    woman. The local press took up the cry, particularly the GUIANA GRAPHIC. The PAO
                    visited each editor personally, cited the 10th Amendment of the Constitution
                    which reserves all power not specifically granted to the federal government for
                    the states, thus tying the hands of the federal government on this specific
                    case, and explained how President Eisenhower and others had urged the Governor
                    of Alabama to exercise leniency. A copy of an IPS pamphlet on the U.S.
                    Government and Constitution was gratefully accepted at the same time by each
