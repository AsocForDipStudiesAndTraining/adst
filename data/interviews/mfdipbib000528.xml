                <p>Interviewed by: G. Lewis Schmidt </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 24, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Lew Schmidt and I am interviewing Elizabeth
                        Hopkins at her retirement home in Tarboro, North Carolina. Liz, for a long
                        time, was in the Binational Center program. In fact, she was practically the
                        moving force in the program for many years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I'm not going to try to say all the things that she did; I'm just going to ask
                    her to take over from here and to start out with a brief discussion of her
                    background, her education and how she got into the service and so forth.</p>
                <p>From time to time, I will ask a question. When I do, I will raise my finger. You
                    finish the sentence you are in and then I'll ask my question so I won't just
                    break in. Please go ahead, Liz, and start out by giving us your background.</p>
                <p>HOPKINS: I was originally from Henderson, Kentucky. Then my family and I moved
                    around over the country a great deal. As a matter of fact, driving back and
                    forth I've been in most all the states except the most recent ones.</p>
                <p>My mother and I spent several years in Salt Lake City where I attended the
                    University of Utah for two and a half years. Then I moved to New York City where
                    I had full-time jobs and continued to study at New York University, receiving a
                    B.A. in English and in Sociology.</p>
                <p>While there, I worked in social service organizations. One of my jobs was in a
                    community center in Green Point. I also worked for the Family Welfare
                    Association of America. Then the war came along and I wanted to do something for
                    the war effort.</p>
                <p>I took an examination which entitled me to come in to the Government as a junior
                    professional assistant. My grade was quite good. Somebody called me and I went
                    down to Washington for an interview with someone in the State Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I was advised that because of the war effort, they were not taking people
                    necessarily from the Civil Service lists. What they needed were secretaries.
                    There was an indication that there would be opportunities for advancement.</p>
                <p>Initial Position in Department of State; 1953</p>
                <p>Wanting to get into the war effort, I came in at a lower salary than I was making
                    in New York and as a secretary. I first worked in the cultural program. I've
                    forgotten the exact name, but it was the education and cultural division.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: 1943. I came into the cultural division and worked as a secretary for
                    several people. While I was there, Carl Sauer was brought back from overseas to
                    head a Binational Center section. A girl named Mary Agnes Young, who later
                    married and became Mrs. Turner, was his assistant.</p>
                <p>The Beginning of the Binational Center Operation</p>
                <p>The program had started when Nelson Rockefeller was Coordinator of Inter American
                    Affairs. A woman named Muriel Leach had been the personnel officer. There were a
                    handful of people overseas in the Binational Centers when the program was turned
                    over to the Department of State.</p>
                <p>Because of the situation at that time, in some of the countries, anyone who went
                    down under the auspices of the State Department without official status would
                    have had to register as a foreign agent. So that was one of the reasons for
                    sending people out on grants. Money for the grants was given to the ACLS, the
                    American Council of Learned Societies.</p>
                <p>The grants were drawn up on ACLS letterheads. They were in charge of the
                    finances. We would take the grants to the ACLS for signature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to ask you, I'm not quite clear on the
                        organizational pattern. You were not in the Office of War Information.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: No, I never was. I was right in the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they still call this organization the Institute of
                        Inter American Affairs at that time or was in under a different title?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HOPKINS: Well, I don't remember what they called it, but it was part of the State
                    Department by this time, and once the transfer was made it was no longer under
                    the Coordinator's office.</p>
                <p>Early Struggles in Getting Binational Center Operation Under Way</p>
                <p>Hersheld Brickell — did you ever know him? He was in charge of the Educational
                    and Cultural Division at this time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, he was before my time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: He was one of the top men there. Carl Sauer was with the Binational
                    Centers when it was decided that things had changed so much that — it was no
                    longer necessary to use the grant system under the ACLS.</p>
                <p>So it was decided that it was time to put the grants under the State Department.
                    Mary Agnes, Mr. Sauer and I — she was the assistant — worked on all this. By the
                    time that we had gotten it more or less set, Mary Agnes got married and left. I
                    was recommended to take the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the personnel —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Under Mr. Sauer as the person in charge of all the personnel under Mr.
                    Sauer. Lionel Landry came back from overseas and we worked together. He had
                    English teaching experience and was a good administrator.</p>
                <p>We continued then, of course, to build the program up. At that time, I don't
                    remember how many people there were but there were not a great many. From then
                    on, as the program expanded, we had quite a number of people in quite a number
                    of places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you start right away into the recruitment operations
                        to bring these people in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes, that's right, recruitment was a big part of my job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about that? Did you travel to some extent
                        around the country or how did you manage it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>HOPKINS: No, it was through the romance language departments of various colleges
                    and through the people that we knew, and through recommendations of various
                    offices already in the program, that we got a recruitment program started.</p>
                <p>At times, I was getting letters from all over the country, people who were
                    interested in the program. Originally, of course, the idea was not to make a
                    career overseas. The grantees were not supposed to make a career of service in
                    the Binational Centers.</p>
                <p>They were supposed to have academic backgrounds. Some of them came in as
                    teachers, as directors of courses, and as directors of activities. Those with
                    administrative qualifications came in as Directors.</p>
                <p>Most of these we could get through universities. The idea was for grantees to
                    come into the program and be sent overseas. It was thought that this experience
                    would help them to make their programs in the universities more interesting when
                    they returned. As they gained a better knowledge of life overseas they would
                    help this [university] program. So this was supposed to be a revolving
                    arrangement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now did you personally draw up the criteria for the hire
                        of these people, or were the criteria already drawn up and given to
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Carl Sauer left and Ed Murphy came in. Ed Murphy and I worked on this
                    together in making up a list of the requirements for getting into the program
                    and then the rules and regulations applicable after they were in the program. We
                    also set up standards for making grants for the different categories.</p>
                <p>At one point when there was a cutback, Ed Murphy and I were the only two people
                    left, I think, in the whole Binational Center Division. I was able to type then,
                    and I had to type since somebody had to get the work out.</p>
                <p>We could only get out things that were really necessary. Mr. Murphy would prepare
                    it and I would write it up. That's the only way things got out for ages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were left in the program at that time despite the big
                        cutback. Was that in 1946 or '47?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes, the great cutback, that's about when it was. Gradually, people came
                    back and we went back to our old jobs. You can certainly get information from
                    Edmund R. Murphy in Washington because he was in the program for a long
                    time.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Then, of course, after people got into the Binational Center program, they liked
                    it. Some of them would later be recommended for transfer into the Foreign
                    Service. We required anybody who came in as a Binational Center grantee to give
                    that program a certain amount of time before transferring to the regular Foreign
                    Service. After all, we had put in a great deal of time and effort to recruiting
                    them.</p>
                <p>I do remember one man who came in as a grantee. He was from down here at Wake
                    Forest. One of the personnel officers for the Far East persuaded him to go to
                    that area. He was qualified either for Latin America or the Far East. Against
                    all the rules, he insisted that this man go to the Far East. Since we were
                    persuaded that an urgent need existed, we allowed him to be given foreign
                    service status without ever going overseas as a grantee.</p>
                <p>Thus he was able to get his way. We tried to avoid that kind of situation. If we
                    had recruited people and brought them in, they were supposed to be interested in
                    the Binational Center program.</p>
                <p>Of course, the BNC Program could be used as a stepping-stone to getting into the
                    Foreign Service eventually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First of all, did you bring them in on a contractual
                        basis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Secondly, was there a fixed term?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thirdly, did you ever renew the contracts for an
                        additional period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Oh, yes. They were supposed to stay at least two years. Actually, I
                    believe it was originally three years. The contract was renewed on a yearly
                    basis. They didn't come back for reorientation and return or reassignment unless
                    they stayed three years. It was later cut to two years.</p>
                <p>The grantees liked the program and some were so good at their jobs that people
                    overseas didn't want to release them. Gradually, we began to see that a core of
                    people who were qualified to move around was better than having to train new
                    people all the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Then officers of the Department, and later the Agency began to look to me for
                    watching the progress of these people and recommending them for the regular
                    programs. So a great many of them who were really worthwhile got to be cultural
                    officers. At one time, they told me, the best PAOs and CAO's were from the BNC
                    program in Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say the regular programs, you're talking about
                        the regular —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Foreign Service, yes. Some, of course, come into the domestic
                    programs.Criteria Used for Selecting Binational Center Personnel</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to backtrack a little bit. You said that you and
                        Ed Murphy worked out the criteria. Basically, what were the criteria for
                        selecting these people? Did they require a foreign language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Oh, yes; for Latin America, Spanish and Portuguese; French for Haiti. We
                    found that if a person spoke Spanish and French, it was easy for him to convert
                    to Portuguese. We didn't always have enough Portuguese-speaking people.</p>
                <p>Candidates were supposed to have good academic backgrounds. Of course, their
                    personality had a lot to do with it. I remember we used to say — they were
                    supposed to have a missionary spirit. We didn't mean in a religious sense. We
                    meant a certain zeal for making a contribution.</p>
                <p>Grantees were supposed to be good teachers and administrators. They were supposed
                    to get along well with people and have all the usual academic and administrative
                    qualifications. If they were directors, they had to have had some experience in

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you bring any of them in directly after graduation
                        from the university or did you bring most of them in after they'd had some
                        additional education experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: We wanted them to have some additional experience. Do you know Gloria
                    Wasielewski Kreisher?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: She came to me when she was 21. She had just graduated from, I believe
                    it was UCLA, and had also gone to the American Institute for Foreign Trade. I
                    said I didn't think that a girl of 21 should be sent overseas.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>She hadn't had any real teaching experience, although she was marvelous in
                    languages. She had excellent Spanish and Portuguese. She went back and got some
                    experience and came back two years later when she was 23 and we hired her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She's still working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes, she's in Rome. I think she has done well in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I knew Gloria primarily when she was in Turkey when I was
                        over there. She got married in Turkey.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Her husband died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know he died.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Three years ago I went over to England to visit relatives. I stopped
                    over in Rome and spent nine days with Gloria. Now she speaks excellent Italian.
                    She does a lot of traveling out of Rome to other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She's sort of a regional officer now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes, she's a regional English teaching officer and sets up seminars.
                    She's even been to China. I think her time is going to be up this September or
                    October unless they persuade her to stay on a little longer.</p>
                <p>This is supposed to be her last tour. She has a condominium there in Washington
                    where, I think, she plans to live after she has retired. She can give you a lot
                    of background since she's been in the program so long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she go into the regular service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Well, she stayed in the Binational Center for a long time. Somebody
                    suggested that she transfer to the regular service as a secretary. I said,
                    “Gloria, if you're asking my advice, don't do it because you'll get tagged as a
                    secretary and you'll have a hard time getting out of it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>So she was in for quite awhile. She always said she thanked me for that advice
                    because when she came in, she had gained some valuable experience. She became
                    director of courses in Mexico, one of the biggest centers. When she came into
                    the Foreign Service, she came in at a good grade and she's worked up from
                    there.</p>
                <p>BNC Programs Achieved Great Success in Latin Americaand Then Expanded to Other
                    Areas</p>
                <p>After the program had been very successful in Latin America, a decision was made
                    to open centers in the Near East, one of two in Europe, and a number in the Far
                    East.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, it was a matter of boning up on all those different countries.
                    Also it was important to know the people in the Latin America program who might
                    have the experience to help establish centers in other areas.</p>
                <p>Jeff Sandel is an example. He was in Rio. He speaks excellent Portuguese and was
                    doing well in Brazil. We needed somebody to go into Cambodia. He was all set. I
                    think he had just gone back, following home leave. I called him and asked if he
                    would be willing to go to Cambodia to open a center.</p>
                <p>I asked if he would discuss it with his wife and let me know by the next day. He
                    loved his assignment in Brazil. He called me back in an hour and said he had
                    talked it over with Helen and that they would go. They picked up their children
                    and went to Cambodia and did a fine job.</p>
                <p>He now speaks Cambodian and Vietnamese and another language, I can't remember
                    which. At one point — later on we sent him to Vietnam. It was thought he was too
                    old to take up a new language. He sure fooled them. He went in there and got
                    something like a three in Vietnamese in a short time.</p>
                <p>Of course, I didn't have that unusual ability. It just comes to some people. So
                    we did use the people from Latin America to build up the other areas. We sent
                    Martin Kushansky over to Manila to open a Center.</p>
                <p>We sent a man to Burma. He left the program and has done very well. He's at the
                    health institute in Bethesda and writes books. His name is Jim Cassidy. He went
                    over to that area from Latin America and that's the way the Centers were
                    established.</p>
                <p>By this time we had established regulations so grantees could stay in the BNC
                    Program. Of course, Sandel got into the regular program and a great many of the
                    others did so after they had given a number of years to the BNC Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a regular system of promotion?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes. Grantees would progress from teacher to director of courses. Some
                    of them who seemed to have qualifications for promoting activities became
                    Directors of Activity. Then those that showed administrative experience would be
                    promoted to Center Directors. So a great many of them came in as teachers and
                    then worked on up.</p>
                <p>Sources of English Language Teaching Materials for BNC's</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were some of them I think who wrote a lot of the
                        materials that were used in the Latin American English teaching
                        program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: That's right, yes. Some of the people that were in at the time that the
                    program came over from the coordinator's office have gone on into writing
                    materials. Of course, there were Will Sheeler, Ken Croft and Ed Cornelius. They
                    were all in the English program, but broke away and established their own
                    company. I think Will is still writing materials. Of course, Gloria Wasielewski,
                    Jim Schols, Jim McGillary and others wrote materials for the program.</p>
                <p>I can't remember all the different people but there were quite a few of them who
                    wrote materials. Some of these materials are still being used in the
                    Centers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have materials initially that you used before
                        materials were written specifically for the BNC's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: May I digress a little here, and tell you a little about the set-up.
                    When I first came in, we were in the Grant Building which was right across from
                    the State Department. It has since been torn down. I think it was three stories
                    and a basement.</p>
                <p>I was on the top floor. I was told that the building had been condemned and there
                    could only be three people on the top floor with three cabinets. Well, while I
                    was there there were at least six people with fifteen cabinets up there. I felt
                    sometimes that I should take a parachute when I went to work.</p>
                <p>I did not have a teaching background. However, materials were needed. So one of
                    my first jobs was to ferret out all the materials on teaching English as a
                    foreign language. I would go to the library and search out materials. So I
                    actually made up the first list of materials that was used in the program for
                    the teaching of English as a foreign language.</p>
                <p>Of course, it's been greatly augmented since then because this field has become
                    very specialized. There are several schools there in Washington that have very
                    good programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that your only experience or only function at that
                        particular time, writing those materials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: No, that was just part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you write later? Did you write additional
                        materials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: No, I never wrote any materials, but I had to find out what materials
                    were available and make lists so that the grantees knew where they could get
                    materials. That's all I did because I was not an English teacher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any of those who wrote the materials people that did
                        that trained as scientific linguists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Well, there was Henry Lee Smith and I've forgotten the name of the other
                    man there in the Foreign Service Institute (FSI). They gave courses. Many of our
                    people took the courses and really became more or less authorities on teaching
                    English as a foreign language. So we really did have a core of
                    professionals.</p>
                <p>A regular promotional structure, travel allowances for families, housing
                    allowances and other “perks” common for regular foreign service personnel were
                    obtained only piecemeal over several years for BNC people</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little while ago you said that there was a system of
                        promotion set up within the group even before they went into the regular
                        Foreign Service. Who made the determination as to who went in — did you have
                        a role in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Oh, yes. I had a role in everything concerning personnel from the start.
                    Of course, at first Ed Murphy was my chief and then much, much later, of course,
                    he went overseas. Then I was under Tony Covins and Frank Cory. All of these
                    officers gave me excellent supervision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were personnel people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: They were personnel people. They put me in Personnel instead of in the
                    Binational Center Division. Of course, they were no authority on Binational
                    Centers, so I was given considerable authority.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a regular grade structure within the BNC
                        operation, or was it just a matter of being promoted to what you considered
                        to be a higher position from the one a grantee had held before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: They moved up if they stayed in the program and were qualified. When
                    this program started, teachers salaries were very low all over the country.</p>
                <p>We were more or less stuck with — since grantees were in the academic field —
                    staying within this range of pay. Then as salaries got better on the outside, we
                    could do better by them but we had a regular structure for the different
                    categories.</p>
                <p>There were different levels of centers. The larger centers would be in the higher
                    level, and so forth. Sometimes small centers were just as important because of
                    various factors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes, particularly in the larger centers, you got
                        into the position where you had overall directors of the center for
                        grantees.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Of course, they had to supervise a lot of local teachers because we
                    could never send down enough teachers. Directors would recruit from the American
                    community and get people to teach part-time. Sometimes the wife of the Director
                    would teach.</p>
                <p>Some people would go overseas just for a sabbatical or some other reason and find
                    out that they could have a fairly decent job. They liked living overseas and
                    they would just stay for a number of years as local teachers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the grantees, was there — I never was quite clear on
                        this — was there ever a system of allowances on housing, for example —
                        allowances as there were with regular Foreign Service people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: We worked into that. At first, the regulations made no provision for
                    that so the total grant would include enough to cover applicable allowances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, it was always covered by the grant. It
                        wasn't identified per se as a housing allowance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: No. Then we finally had new regulations. Also, in the early days of the
                    BNC Program, we only paid the travel of the person who was on grant. Well, not
                    always, because we had several couples where the wife was also a teacher, had
                    linguistic ability, etc., and was thus also allowed travel. So we would give her
                    a part-time grant so we could pay her travel.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>We finally had regulations which permitted us to provide the grantees with
                    specified allowances, travel for families, and many of the benefits which
                    regular Foreign Service personnel received. In one instance, we sent a man to
                    Mexico as director and his wife who had really good qualifications, as a
                    Director of Courses.</p>
                <p>I always tried to save the department money, so I sent a telegram down giving all
                    of his qualifications and everything and said “wife can be hired locally.” You
                    remember Abbie Lincoln in the State Department?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Well, she and I were good friends. She called me and said, “Ms. Hopkins,
                    how do you know he wants to hire a wife?” So I had to change the telegram and
                    say his wife is qualified and may be hired locally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Until that was worked out, initially the principal was
                        sent but he had to finance his family's trip to the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes, but included everything we could in the total grant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any home leave arrangement provided?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: No, not automatically. I don't know how much of this you want to get
                    into. This was one reason we had to have new regulations, so we could let them
                    have official home leave when they came up for training prior to transferring or
                    returning to the same port.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were still covered by a salary under the grant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So although there was no official home leave —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Not official, but by changing the regulations, as I said before,
                    grantees could get many more benefits. We would send them over to the regular
                    travel and the travel people would take care of the whole family just as if they
                    were in the regular program. This made life easier for everybody.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a role in getting that additional help for
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Oh, yes, I was working on that kind of problem all the time. Also we
                    eventually got them covered under the Blue Cross/Blue Shield. My office did
                    that. I was quite busy taking care of the grants, particularly certain times of
                    the year.</p>
                <p>All the grants would have to be negotiated. It all seemed to come up at one time.
                    When people came back for home leave, sometimes I'd hold them there in
                    Washington for reorientation, and also to give them a chance to be
                    re-Americanized and so forth.</p>
                <p>Several people helped on getting hospitalization coverage. We finally got them so
                    they were covered under the health insurance as a special group. We were always
                    working to try to get them benefits as nearly as possible like those received by
                    those in programs.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, the cars, that was a problem. They couldn't get cars in free. I
                    know we worked on that. In some places, they were treated as Foreign Service
                    personnel overseas and some places not. In some places, they could take their
                    cars.</p>
                <p>I was constantly working to try to get benefits for them. It was my office that
                    was the central point for that kind of activity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that you helped in many, many ways. I was just
                        trying to bring out the particular areas in which you were able to get the
                        type of benefit available to regular Foreign Service people. How long did it
                        take you on each of these cases? Did you have to work on it for a long
                        period of time; for instance, on the medical coverage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes, that took quite awhile. We finally got them under the Social
                    Security also. A woman named Lucille Dudgeon who was a librarian became
                    interested. I guess some of them were her friends and she helped a lot in that
                    effort.</p>
                <p>Social Security finally came through. That was a big step forward. So at least
                    while they were not working for a pension from the Agency, they were at least
                    covered by Social Security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of any other things that are worth
                        recounting about the growth of the program, really, the development, I
                        should say, not so much the growth, because we take that for granted? I'm
                        thinking of the whole matter of gradually improving the lot of the people
                        who went abroad, giving them privileges that were normal for the Foreign
                        Service but that they didn't have?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>HOPKINS: It seems like we were always working, along with everything else, on
                    getting benefits. We did want to make benefits as near like the Foreign Service
                    without being the Foreign Service as possible so they would be more content and
                    not feel like they were second-class citizens.</p>
                <p>Of course, I think that's one thing they always said. They'd see secretaries who
                    could get a car in and they couldn't. Things like that bothered some of the.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose they were having to travel and be in the other
                        countries on regular passports too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that mean that in many countries they had to renew
                        their visas for those countries every six months or were they able to get in
                        on a two or three year visa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: I think they were able to get in on at least a yearly basis. Of course
                    some countries were more difficult than others. I don't remember that living in
                    this country was any great problem. It was the traveling on regular passports,
                    no free entry of the car, and lack of benefits which they thought added to their
                    standing in the community.</p>
                <p>I think that some of the grantees really got to know the people of the country
                    far better than the people higher up, because they would work closely with them.
                    So I think it was a good program in that they were really getting to the
                    people.</p>
                <p>Of course, now centers don't have very many regular jobs. They have very few. I
                    think it takes the American presence to make it really worthwhile.</p>
                <p>The Eventual Integration of BNC Personnel Into RegularForeign Service was
                    Detrimental to the BNC Program Per Se</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it does too. You said earlier when we were talking
                        off the record that you felt that the inclusion, the integration of the BNC
                        personnel into the Foreign Service was detrimental to the Binational Center
                        program per se.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I know you gave me some reasons but those are not on tape. Could you talk a
                    little bit about that? Why you feel it was not so good for the program?</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>HOPKINS: Well, the program — the number of personnel assigned to the Binational
                    Center has gone down and down because before integration, BNC's were a separate
                    entity, and had a separate budget. We got separate money for the Bi- national
                    Center Program personnel. Even if jobs were cut out of the regular program, we
                    had our money and we could continue to keep personnel overseas. As a matter of
                    fact, the grants were made for a full year at a time.</p>
                <p>Once BNC personnel came into the program, if the PAO or whoever was responsible
                    for the post was really interested in the Binational Center, they might keep the
                    Binational Centerposition. If not, when a cut came, that was the first job to
                    go.</p>
                <p>So you got fewer and fewer people overseas. Also as I said, these young Foreign
                    Service officers came in — not very many of them had a teaching background or an
                    academic background of the kind that they really needed for Binational Center
                    work, and they didn't want to be assigned to a BNC.</p>
                <p>They wanted to be in the cultural program in the Embassy. So they were not
                    interested in going to these institutions. Whereas, if you hire people
                    specifically for the Centers, it seemed to work out better. Some Foreign Service
                    officers just go the Centers because they have to, but immediately begin to work
                    on getting out, and getting into some other phase of the program, because they
                    feel that the Centers are sort of low on the totem pole, especially when it
                    comes to promotion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know a few who stayed with the Bi- national Center
                        program all the way through even after they got into the regular
                        service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess those were relatively few. Milt Leavitt was one
                        who stayed with it pretty much all the way through.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: He had a heart attack, a stroke or something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had a stoke.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: How is he?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's coming along fairly well, but he hasn't recovered a
                        great deal of his right side mobility. He was not originally brought into
                        the Agency for the Binational Centers. However he did very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Did you know that he was in that Bataan Death march?</p>
                <p>I felt he really deserved to have a chance. If he did get into the Binational
                    Centers and did well, then it would give him another chance.</p>
                <p>Anyway, this got him back into the main swing. I'm glad of that. People are
                    wandering around the Agency all the time. Then the right job comes up and he or
                    she gets it. I just think it is very sad the way some people wander around for a
                    long time before they find the right assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of them are very good people, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: I'm sorry that he hasn't completely recovered.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Let's get to the point here. We may be jumping around a little bit, but let's get
                    to the point. Integration was finally arranged. Did you tell me when we were
                    talking off the record that you really had no great part in the initiating the
                    integration itself but that you did have a substantial role in recommending
                    those people for integration into regular Foreign Service?</p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Well, yes, and doing considerable administration work to close out the
                    Grantee program and get the people into the regular programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You handled all the administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes, some of the administration. There was a great deal that had to be
                    done to effect the change-over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also recommended the people whom you felt were
                        qualified to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: That's right, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did some of them — it wasn't then a wholesale integration.
                        Some of the people didn't make it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Well, there were some people who remained. They were overage and not
                    qualified. There was a man who did a very fine job and who recently died — about
                    two or three years ago — Reese Wolfe, did you know him?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I knew his name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: He did a very good job. He was a writer with the Reader's Digest and was
                    going to write a history of the Binational Center program when he got out. We
                    were going to have him stop by several posts. His last port was in
                    Argentina.</p>
                <p>Then when the takeover was effected, they wanted the people on grant whose grants
                    were not going to be renewed, to come straight back to their homes because there
                    was no need for them to come here, or make any stopovers.</p>
                <p>So he did that and he never did write anything. Then Bernice Schmidt was overage,
                    also. There were some like that. They were just not qualified to come in, but
                    not because they were not doing a good job.</p>
                <p>It was rather sad. There was one person who always wanted to come into the
                    program but for some reason or another, we never could get her transferred. She
                    was marvelous with the little people overseas, but she antagonized the Embassy
                    people — the Americans. So they would not recommend her. She almost got in once
                    and then there was a cutback just before she was to report. Then by the time
                    they were all integrated, she had left the program, and had died. So she didn't
                    even know about the change in status, which is probably a good thing.</p>
                <p>It was sad sometimes that people wanted to do good jobs, but fall short. I still
                    get Christmas cards every year from people whom we had to let go. People can do
                    a good job state-side and can seem to have the qualifications but cannot fit in
                    overseas.</p>
                <p>There was one man in Brazil who got into trouble with the Brazilian Board. He had
                    an awful temper and got into a fight with the president of the board. They asked
                    that we recall him. We didn't feel that we could put him anywhere else in
                    Brazil. I kept up with him. I felt that he was a human being. He got into a
                    college out in California and did an excellent job. He used to have to go to
                    Latin America to recruit people for his college.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>It's a college which has special interests for Latin Americans. So we used to
                    send down to the Binational Centers information regarding his itinerary so he
                    could talk to the local people when he visited BNC cities. Unfortunately, he has
                    died. I get a card from his widow every year just like we're the greatest of
                    friends. I didn't let it make any difference. If they ever came to Washington, I
                    would invite them to the Bi- national Center luncheon at DACOR and nobody would
                    ever know that they had left the program under any kind of a cloud just because
                    they didn't quite make it. It wasn't any use. As individuals, I liked them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: That's right. They had the language and they had the background, but
                    working with the board — it's a difficult position sometimes.</p>

                        troubles with the Binational Center Director in Sao Paulo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You had mentioned the man was very difficult up there. I think there were a few
                    things that we didn't cover completely about your feeling and other people's
                    feelings about the implications of the Binational Center's directors integration
                    into the regular foreign service. It was good for them personally, but it didn't
                    help the program.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I think you wanted to make clear that you never said anything against that
                    integration.</p>
                <p>HOPKINS: No, I worked for the integration. I had the feeling that once we no
                    longer had a specific budget just for Binational Center personnel and they were
                    integrated into the regular program, that BNC jobs might be the positions that
                    would be eliminated, in the case of a budget reduction. I think this has come to
                    pass because we have a great many fewer positions with Americans from here than
                    we had prior to the integration.</p>
                <p>Summary of Ways in Which Integration Hurt the BNC Operation</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think now from what you said — let me see if I can
                        summarize the results of this change, and you can tell me that I'm wrong if
                        you think so — I think, one, you felt that when the people were on a
                        contract basis working almost on a separate but parallel career within the
                        Binational Center program, a certain specialist Esprit de Corps arose among
                        the people who were Binational Center directors. They felt they had a cause
                        and a career within the service of BNC's which was more or less — I hate to
                        use the word destroyed but which sort of disintegrated with the transfer of
                        these people to the regular service. Is that a correct statement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes, I think that's right. Although there were many who did have this
                    feeling for the program, but because of the fact that they didn't have all of
                    the benefits that the other people had, quite frequently it was hard for them
                    not to be dissatisfied.</p>
                <p>So to have a satisfied group of people, that's what you got out of the
                    integration. Gradually the number of American personnel from here has diminished
                    considerably around the world because of the fact that there's no longer a
                    separate budget and a separate program. It's just part of the regular
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that's the second point. The Agency has diminished the
                        number of people funded by USIA who are available for work in the Binational
                        Centers. A corollary of that, I guess, is something that we spoke of off the
                        record; that is that with a general cutback in the foreign service, which
                        occurred starting about eight or ten years ago, posts were required to
                        eliminate positions. Very often they cut back one or two positions out of
                        the Binational Center rather than cutting them out of the program within
                        what the post sometimes considered the mainstream of the program. So that
                        was another reason for the decline.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Then the third one that you were talking about off the record is the fact that
                    apparently, and unfortunately, the agency does not seem to have given the same
                    standing within the promotional structure of the agency to Binational Center
                    people that they have from regular cultural officers and other people.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Therefore, most people have the feeling that there's less opportunity for getting
                    into the mainstream of the program if they are assigned to a Binational
                    Center.</p>
                <p>HOPKINS: I think that's true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The result, therefore, is that the new people coming in,
                        come in through the junior office trainee program, and nowadays, through the
                        Foreign Service exam have rather infrequently opted for the BNC program
                        because they feel that their chances of going up in the service are much
                        better by going into other positions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: That is my opinion, you may want to get other viewpoints. Another thing
                    that we didn't cover was a special arrangement we had. About twice a year, we
                    arranged to have the newcomers come into the Agency during the summer and in
                    December. At the same time that we had new people in, we would bring the
                    overseas people back who were eligible for home leave so that they would have a
                    chance to talk and to help each other.</p>
                <p>The ones who were new would benefit greatly. Sometimes there would be a person
                    from the same post to which a new person was going, and they could get a lot of
                    information and help in that way.</p>
                <p>We had special training for these people for these specific jobs, which they
                    don't have anymore. There was a regular program set up with the other elements
                    of the agency that included spending some time with the Book program, the
                    library program and all the various elements affecting BNC work. And time was
                    spent with the area directors and so forth. Some of this was included in the
                    regular training program.</p>
                <p>BNC personnel veterans had an opportunity to refresh themselves on what was going
                    on in the Agency. So they would stay several weeks and there would be this
                    overlap with the new people and the old people. We did that for years.</p>
                <p>I think that helped. I do think these practices built up an Esprit de Corps among
                    BNC personnel. They all felt that we were all in this thing together and that
                    they benefited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's true that the success in the Binational
                        Center program does require a certain expertise. If you throw someone in
                        there without special training for that particular type of operation, you do
                        him a disservice and you do the program a disservice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hadn't realized — I guess I just hadn't thought about
                        it, but you had a special training program for these people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes, we did. We'd have the teachers and the directors of courses, the
                    directors and the directors of the activities. They would have various programs.
                    A lot of it was together and some of it would be separate.</p>
                <p>Grantees had the opportunity while they were here to talk to all the various
                    people in the agency. Then we used to have those parties — do you remember? — We
                    would give the Grantees an opportunity to meet some of the Agency higher ups.
                    We'd always invite some of the higher ups.</p>
                <p>I remember we had one at Ms. Dungeon's. I don't know whether you went to that one
                    or not. Don Wilson came to that one. I guess several of the directors came. that
                    would given an opportunity for all the people than they would have seen in their
                    training program and people in the agency, to see them on a social basis.</p>
                <p>Also it was good for the new people coming in. You know, we had quite a number of
                    Mormons come in. They, of course, were against drinking. We had to show them
                    that that's up to them. Nobody wanted them to drink and nobody wanted them to do
                    anything that was against their religion.</p>
                <p>However, they should not make remarks about anybody who did take a drink. They
                    were to take a glass of ginger ale or something non-alcoholic and carry it
                    around all evening.</p>
                <p>I always thought we were supposed to get a cross section of America. You know, we
                    have some people from Harvard and some people from the other big colleges, some
                    people who were from little tiny colleges out in the Midwest. They are all part
                    of America.</p>
                <p>I didn't think we should have all people with Harvard accents. I can tell you
                    several funny things about accents. When we first started the program, we hired
                    a girl from Texas who had excellent qualifications but quite a Texas accent.
                    Under the coordinator's office, personnel went directly overseas without coming
                    through Washington.</p>
                <p>When the program came into the State Department, a practice was initiated of
                    having them come in to Washington for training before going abroad. This was
                    much better. And then having group training was even better. Well, anyway,
                    during the war, travelers had to stop in Panama and have a British visa for some
                    reason or another.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I got a call from a woman who said, “Ms. Hopkins, there's a woman here who says
                    you sent her down. She's from Texas and she says that you're sending her
                    overseas to teach English and we can't understand her.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Her Texas accent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes, she really had a Texas accent. She did a very good job and wrote
                    some good materials and was well- liked overseas.</p>
                <p>The group that went from the coordinator's office didn't come through here at
                    all. This was all something that was initiated later. Then, I, at one point,
                    sent — I think it was to Thailand — several people from Texas.</p>
                <p>I don't know whether you were there or not. Did you send a communication?
                    Somebody said that there was a communication saying, “Tell Ms. Hopkins not to
                    send anymore Texans out here or all the Thais will be speaking with a Texas
                    accent.” I had sent several out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was not I. It may have been Jack O'Brien who was my
                        predecessor, or Howard Gomish, or Jack Pickering, all of whom preceded
                        me.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Something like that happened and the cable said don't send anymore
                    because they'll all be speaking with a Texas accent. I guess it just happened
                    that several went to that particular post at various times.</p>
                <p>I always thought the Grantees were such a nice group. Our literature specified
                    that they were supposed to have an outgoing personality, and we tried to see to
                    that, and that they had all the various attributes which would make them fit in
                    overseas and would make them like people and make people like them. The Grantees
                    selected were generally well-liked.</p>
                <p>These programs that we arranged to get them together [in Washington], we did that
                    for years and years. I think that was one of the things that drew them together.
                    They met here as a group and then they would write each other from the
                    posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: USIA had a program — I have forgotten what they called it
                        — in which people were asked to send in particular ideas that they had tried
                        and in their posts and had found effective. Those that were selected as
                        being particularly good would then be printed and sent out to other posts as
                        examples of program activities that might work elsewhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>HOPKINS: Sometimes BNC people would write and say, “What do you do in a case like
                    this? Have you ever had this happen?” They could — particularly after they got
                    pouch privileges use the pouch for anything that was official.</p>
                <p>I worked on those requests for advice for so many years and so many different
                    times. I believe that the first man, whoever he was, was in charge of the pouch
                    said, “Oh, no, you can't do that.” Later on we got somebody in charge of the
                    pouch that was a little bit more lenient. So they did have a lot more
                    leeway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long was the training program that you were
                        giving?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Well, from two to six weeks. If they had been overseas for three years
                    and since — at one point, you see, they couldn't go on home leave for two months
                    like other overseas staff, we'd keep them here for, say, about six weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you first brought somebody into the program for a
                        training period, how long was it for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: That would be about the same as for BNC who were in for “home leave”,
                    because they would be here together. Some of them had been teaching foreign
                    languages and so forth and didn't have too much background of teaching English
                    as a foreign language.</p>
                <p>So we would give them some training. Sometimes we'd send them over to the Foreign
                    Service Institute for a six-week course. We had all kinds of situations.
                    Sometimes we'd give a language brush up — if they were transferring to another
                    country from Spanish to Portuguese. We always tried to meet special needs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to put any of them into the Foreign Service
                        Institute Language Study?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Well, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, if they were shifting to another language.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes, we did use the services of the FSI. I am trying to remember whether
                    Jeff was in the regular program before he took Cambodian and Vietnamese. They
                    got into the regular training and we provided short courses. We wouldn't given
                    them a year or anything like that but we'd give them a brush up.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Actually, some of them liked the Binational Center program so much that I'm sure
                    some of them would like to have remained in it. It's always the idea of getting
                    up the ladder and into something permanent which appeals. Therefore, many wanted
                    to get into the regular program.</p>
                <p>Some of them, even, who did transfer said that they enjoyed what they did in the
                    Binational Centers as much as any work they had ever done with the Agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A lot of the Binational Centers — I don't know that a lot
                        is a correct statement — but a fair number of the Binational Centers were so
                        influential in their communities, so well known, that anybody who directed
                        the center had his own prestige within the community.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Often it was higher than the prestige of others in the program, or even more so.
                    Sometimes a Grantee knew the local cultural people, the local educators, and the
                    local artistic groups better than any of the people in the regular Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>HOPKINS: They were often invited to special events. Sometimes jealousy was
                    aroused because the Binational Center people would be invited to events by the
                    high officials of the other countries to which other Embassy or USIA people were
                    not invited. So sometimes that caused a little trouble.</p>
                <p>We ran into all kinds of problems when we got the salaries up a little bit and
                    were able to have a step up kind of program. I remember we sent somebody to La
                    Pa — He had been in for a long time, I think — and his salary was higher — or at
                    least the same as an assistant CAO. The Assistant CAO didn't like that, having
                    someone on grant to get the same or even more than he was receiving. We ran into
                    all kinds of things like that.</p>
                <p>As I look back on it, I couldn't have done anything that I enjoyed more than my
                    work, because I have always liked people. It was hard work. During the war, I
                    put in a lot of overtime, when we were getting the program started. I always
                    felt it was really a worthwhile program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you give some of those parties about which you spoke
                        at your own apartment or were they all in the agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Well, no. I had some at the best addresses in Georgetown. I would ask
                    people to let us use their names. My mother was with me there for a lot of the
                    time and it would be hard to give large parties. She died at 95 years of age,
                    after my retirement. She loved to meet the Grantees, and enjoyed the buffet
                    suppers I have for 12 people. I had some at my apartment, generally in smaller
                    groups. Jim Echols once invited the group down, when he had that place near
                    Annapolis. I don't know whether you went to that one or not; you were probably
                    overseas — he had a delightful place down on the Severn River.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>I said I was trying to find some place where we could have a party out of doors.
                    He and Mary said, “Sure come on down.” We fixed a picnic and had it at a lovely
                    spot on the Severn River.</p>
                <p>They had a lovely home. We all went down there for one of the best parties ever.
                    I would generally form a committee and then we would all have a certain part of
                    it. I would often cook a ham and deviled eggs and whatever was necessary. Others
                    would have specific assignments and then we'd get it all together.</p>
                <p>We'd have quite a few parties in Georgetown. Louise Dudgeon, whom I mentioned
                    before, let us use her house. Of course, she came and helped. Sometimes I used
                    to get a caterer through the Cosmos Club. There was a man who had charge of
                    their dining room whose name was Nipson. I would call him for some of the
                    parties. He would send the glasses and everything I needed, and a man, or
                    sometimes a man and a woman, one to handle the bar and one to serve or do
                    whatever was necessary.</p>
                <p>Then we would divide the cost between all the officers who had something to do
                    with grantee training. We had a lot of those.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember one party I attended at your apartment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: I did give some of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't remember whether it was one for the Binational
                        Center or not. I think it was. The curtain caught fire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Yes, Dick Wilhelm put it out. Yes, I remember that. That was one of
                    those parties I had at my house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else you think that you'd like to
                        add?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOPKINS: Well, let's turn it off.</p>
