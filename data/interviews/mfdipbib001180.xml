                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 10, 1997</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is February 10, 1997. This is an interview with
                        Donald C. Tice, a retired Foreign Service Officer. I am Charles Stuart
                        Kennedy. Don, could you tell me where and when you were born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, I was born in Summerfield, Kansas, on March 27, 1932.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give me a little bit about your family: who you
                        father and mother were and what they were doing, and a little bit about your
                        early education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, When I was born, Summerfield, Kansas, was a little town of about 300
                    people. Now it's less than that. It “died on the vine” when the railroad, which
                    had caused its establishment, went bankrupt in 1928. So, when I was growing up
                    in the 1930's, the town that was already dying. However, it was a wonderful,
                    “Norman Rockwell” [20th century American painter and illustrator for the
                    “Saturday Evening Post”] kind of place to grow up.</p>
                <p>My father was the pharmacist in town. My mother was a housewife, although with
                    the onset of World War II, my mother started working in the drugstore when most
                    of the young men in the town and surrounding area went into military service or
                    went to larger towns to work in defense industries. Many other women similarly
                    took paid jobs during World War II. She continued to work in the drugstore until
                    she was quite well on in years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about school? Could a town of less than 300 people
                        support a school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Oh, yes, because the rural areas surrounded it. At that time, prior to
                    World War II, nearly every 80 acres of land had a farmstead and farm family
                    living on it. That meant up to four farmsteads on many section of land. Now, if
                    you go out into the rural areas in that part of Kansas, you'll find, maybe, one
                    working farmstead for every couple of square miles. So there were a lot more
                    people in the area when I was growing up.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>At that time there still were many one-room country school houses where students
                    in the first eight grades were taught. The high school I went to had, I would
                    guess, about 100 kids in it. I graduated in a class of only eight people, the
                    smallest for a long time. Keep in mind, however, that I was born in 1932 in the
                    depths of the “Great Depression,” and very few people were having children. You
                    could hardly support a family under the circumstances. Another phenomenon came
                    into play regarding the size of classes. I think that there were something like
                    28 students in my freshman class at high school. There was a big “fallout” in
                    the immediate post-war period, with people moving away. In addition, in that day
                    and age, a girl couldn't stay in high school she got pregnant, and if the boy in
                    the equation was in school, he usually had to quit to assume his family
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At least up through high school, it doesn't sound like a
                        very promising preparation to be a diplomat, out there in the middle of
                        Kansas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Well, I had two things going for me. Neither of my parents attended
                    university. My father got his license as a pharmacist by apprenticeship. They
                    were determined that both my brother and I would get degrees, and there was
                    never any question about my going to a university.</p>
                <p>The other circumstance was that I was the object of an educational conspiracy in
                    high school. When I was beginning my freshman year, my father was Chairman of
                    the School Board. He served in that position for something like 18 years. The
                    Principal of the High School came to him and said that he wanted to informally
                    move me into 2nd year classes with a group of more advanced students who were
                    college bound because I already had a mastery of the first-year work and would
                    simply be marking time. My father agreed, with the result that I had finished
                    the regular curriculum by the end of the third year. In my senior year I took a
                    few courses I had skipped before, and also was assigned some special projects
                    which had me doing some research writing.</p>
                <p>I was supported in all of this by some exceptionally good teacher who held my
                    feet to the fire. I was never “cut any slack” [i.e., they never “let up” on me].
                    When I would do something that was probably superior to what the others in the
                    class were doing, the teachers hold me to a standard based on what I was capable
                    of, not what I had done. So I got a little “special education” there.
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you graduate from high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: In 1950.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Korean War had started. What happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I went on to the University of Kansas, where I was enrolled in the ROTC
                    [Reserve Officers Training Corps]. I originally had the intention of going to
                    Medical School, because that was what my father told me I should do, and I
                    thought that he probably knew best.</p>
                <p>However, during my freshman year I had the experience of cutting up a frog in
                    biology class, and I decided that this wasn't for me. I transferred to the
                    journalism program. Ultimately, I graduated with the degree of Bachelor of
                    Science in Journalism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in the 1950's? The Cold War had
                        started, and the Korean War was “going strong” during almost the entire
                        period that you were at the University of Kansas. Did the subject of foreign
                        affairs intrude on your consciousness? Were you looking at foreign affairs
                        at all at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I became aware of foreign affairs and interested in them through my classes
                    in journalism. There</p>
                <p>I had some excellent professors who tried to guide us on what we took in the
                    College of Liberal Arts, in terms of history and political science. They
                    virtually “forced us to read newspapers.” That meant that you had to have read
                    the daily newspaper every day before you went to your first class, or you were
                    “dead meat” [likely to be “marked down” by the professor].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Kansas in the 1950's how did you find international
                        news coverage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: We read the “Kansas City Star” and “Topeka Daily Capital.” Neither of them
                    was particularly good on foreign affairs, so I also read “Time” and “Newsweek.”
                    I would say that I depended more on the news magazines than on the daily
                    newspapers for international news.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you graduated from the University of Kansas in
                        1954?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>TICE: I went right into the U. S. Air Force. The Korean War was over by that
                    time, but the draft was alive and well I had been in the Air Force ROTC [Reserve
                    Officers Training Corps], but because they were reducing the size of the armed
                    forces, commissions were not being given to Air Force ROTC graduates unless they
                    could go to pilot training. I couldn't pass they eye test, so my choice was to
                    be drafted or accept a two-year enlistment in the Air Force, entering as Airman
                    Third Class via an abbreviated basic training course. I decided to go ahead and
                    do that.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to San Antonio, TX. I never left there. I was there for two
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this at Brooks or Lackland Air Force Base?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I was at Lackland Air Force Base.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I did my Air Force basic training at Lackland in the
                        summer of 1950.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I was assigned to what they called “Permanent Party” at Lackland Air Force
                    Base there. As an enlisted man I ended up as the “Non Commissioned Officer in
                    Charge” of a unit which was set up with a bunch of other ROTC NCO's to write
                    correspondence textbooks which were to parallel the academic curriculum of the
                    Officer Candidate School (OCS). My unit was co-located with the OCS at
                    Lackland.</p>
                <p>My first discovery was that the Officer Candidate School didn't have anything
                    recognizable as an academic curriculum, so we wrote one. [Laughter] It was
                    really great fun. We had this group of people, all college graduates, living in
                    a barracks. We had our own barracks and set our own pace. What we did was create
                    an academic curriculum. It was a very interesting 14 month assignment.</p>
                <p>Then, unfortunately, I was commissioned a Second Lieutenant and wound up running
                    a “billeting office,” which was probably the least challenging thing that I've
                    ever done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when did you get out of the Air Force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: In 1956.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you set out any “fishing lines” for other jobs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>TICE: I had worked as a newspaper “stringer” for United Press while I was at the
                    University of Kansas. I got to do quite a lot of work for them, particularly in
                    sports area. The University of Kansas was a big sports school, and I was the UP
                    “stringer” for sports. At one time my roommate in the fraternity was Wes Santee,
                    who was the guy most famous for saying: “Sure, I'll run the forum on my own” in
                    a 'Life' Magazine in which he was featured on the cover. However, Santee got at
                    cross-purposes with Avery Brundage [Chairman of the American Athletic Union] and
                    was disqualified from amateur athletics before he could do so. The four-minute
                    barrier was broken by England's Roger Banister in the spring of 1954. Santee did
                    break Pavo Nurmi's Olympic mark and held the world record for about a year at
                    4.0.4</p>
                <p>I also interviewed for a job with the “Topeka Daily Capital.” the principal
                    newspaper in Kansas. I decided to go with them when I left the Air Force because
                    they were prepared to pay me about 25 percent more than United Press, which, in
                    any case, had no idea of where they would send me. So I decided to take “the
                    devil that I knew” and went to work for the “Topeka Daily Capital.” I stayed
                    there for a year.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, I had taken the Foreign Service written exam twice, failed t the first
                    time, and passed the second. When I didn't pass it the first time, I got a bunch
                    of “College Outline” pamphlets on economics, politics, world and U.S. history,
                    and government, and memorized a crib list my wife created on art, architecture,
                    music, painting, and literature. I took the written exam for the second time in
                    the spring, before I left the Air Force. This time I passed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you hear about the Foreign Service and what
                        inspired you to try for it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: My wife was interested in it, but, of course, married women were not
                    permitted to join the Foreign Service. One of my colleagues in this Air Force
                    textbook writing outfit said that he was applying to take the Foreign Service
                    written exam, and he suggested that I go along with him. So I put in an
                    application to take the exam. This was in the aftermath of the “McCarthy era”
                    [reference to Senator Joseph McCarthy, Republican, Wisconsin] when the State
                    Department was trying very hard to recruit people for the Foreign Service, which
                    had been decimated in the earlier part of that decade by the good Senator's
                    charges of communist infiltration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you entered the Foreign Service, were you able to
                        talk to anybody about what the Foreign Service did or anything like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>TICE: I had never met a Foreign Service Officer until I showed up in Washington,
                    DC, to enter the State Department. In retrospect, by the way, this was the point
                    when Senator Fulbright [Democrat, Arkansas] was a member of the Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee. Senator Fulbright wasn't Chairman of the Committee. Senator
                    Theodore Francis Green [Democrat, Rhode Island] was the Chairman at that time.
                    Senator Green was an elderly gentleman who was sort of “half awake” most of the
                    time, and Senator Fulbright, in effect, pretty much ran the Committee. Fulbright
                    was making a big “push” at that time for broadening the “base of recruitment”
                    for the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I've always felt that I was one of the early “affirmative action” candidates for
                    the Foreign Service. I had not gone to Princeton, Yale, Harvard, or Dartmouth
                    and I was born West of the Mississippi. In any case, I got in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I entered the Foreign Service in 1955. I remember that at
                        that time there was talk about a “massive infusion of Main Street” into the
                        Foreign Service. Where did you take your oral examination?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: In St. Louis, MO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall how the oral examination that you took was
                        conducted or any of the questions asked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, I do. There were three people on the board. It was all very “stiff and
                    formal.” I don't remember the names of any of the members of the board. One of
                    them later was head of BEX [Board of Examiners of the Foreign Service], but his
                    name escapes me now.</p>
                <p>The most embarrassing question that they asked me was to name the original 13
                    colonies which later made up the United States. I learned later that that was
                    considered a good, “trick” question. In any case, I could only name 12 of the
                    original 13 colonies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's like trying to name the “Seven Dwarfs” in the “Snow
                        White” story.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: They asked me some questions on economics. I'd been “boning up” on that
                    subject and was forewarned on that kind of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>They asked me to name three successes and three failures in American foreign
                    policy. I don't remember all of my answers now, but I said that one of the
                    successes was the “Open Door” policy on China. We got into quite a debate on
                    that, because one of the board members was a China expert. After this discussion
                    had gone on for some time, the fellow who was debating this with me said: “Well,
                    do I take it that you have changed your mind and have decided that the 'Open
                    Door' policy wasn't a 'success?'” I said: “Oh, no, if that's what you think, I
                    very badly expressed myself, so let's start all over again.” [Laughter] He said:
                    “Oh, no.” However, when I finished the interview and left the room, I was very
                    quickly called back in by the chairman of the oral board, who told me that I had
                    passed, but “just barely.” He said: “Let me tell you. You're probably one of the
                    least qualified candidates that we've ever examined.” He really ripped me up one
                    side and down the other about all of the things that I didn't know. I went away
                    very happy but chastened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you get married, by the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I was married in 1955, while I was in the Air Force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you start your basic officer's course at the
                        State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: In August, 1957.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give me a little feel of the type of people who
                        were in that course at that time and, perhaps, how the training program
                        struck you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes. There were, I think, 33 people in the course. As a whole, it was one
                    of the oldest groups to enter the Foreign Service. There was quite a range of
                    ages. I think that the oldest person in the course was Peter Sebastian. Peter
                    was delayed in being accepted because he was not American born. He had to be a
                    citizen for 10 years before he could come into the Foreign Service. The youngest
                    member of the class was Dick Dwyer, now dead, who was then 22.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I would say that the majority were from the traditional schools that you would
                    think of for people entering the Foreign Service. In addition to the
                    “traditional schools,” some of them had gone to the Georgetown School of Foreign
                    Service. They were the ones who did all the talking. I recall that I was quite
                    intimidated when I showed up for the “A-100” course [the entering FSO course].
                    They all came in carrying copies of “The New York Times” and were talking about
                    foreign policy issues. I had never read “The New York Times” and did not talk
                    about foreign policy issues. [Laughter] However, I quickly “cottoned onto” the
                    fact that there was a bunch of other people like me who weren't doing all the
                    talking but who, as it became clear, were just as smart as the others but not
                    quite as articulate or as sure of themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there was a certain amount of “posturing,” too. When
                        you came into the Foreign Service, it was a time when one dressed fairly
                        impeccably. Speaking for myself, I felt almost as if I had gotten into the
                        wrong “Club” when I entered the Foreign Service. I felt that my classmates
                        in the A-100 course were all fancy dudes...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Oh, very much so. As a matter of fact, I owned only two suits at the time.
                    One of them was “fawn colored.” I quickly “ditched” that one and went into
                    “hock” to get another suit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have gone to S. S. Schwartz in Baltimore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about minority or women members of the
                        class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: There were two women in our class: Phyllis Spaulding, I think, who later
                    married Bob Oakley. Eventually, when they dropped the ridiculous rule that a
                    married woman couldn't be a Foreign Service Officer, she was able to return to
                    the Foreign Service and is now an Assistant Secretary of State. There was
                    another woman in the class whose name I forget right now. There were no
                    “minority” members of the class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your training was there much about American foreign
                        policy or the background of the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, there was. We had some “area” lecturers and that kind of thing, but I
                    don't remember that their lectures were particularly “deep.” At that time I
                    heard very little about the Foreign Service at all. However, I remember the
                    language training courses much more vividly because they were so much more
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you entered the Foreign Service, were your interested
                        in some special area or function?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I was interested in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and in political
                    analysis and reporting. I was initially assigned to an administrative job in one
                    of the old, temporary buildings down by the Reflecting Pool between the
                    Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. Not the Navy Annex buildings on
                    Constitution Ave. but the little, two story temporary buildings along the
                    Reflecting Pool. I was in the “A” [Administrative] Area, working on regulations
                    and procedures. It was something less than inspiring work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was after you finished the A-100 course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, it was after I finished the A-100 class. That assignment to the “A”
                    area lasted for a little less than a couple of years [1957-1959]. Then I was
                    assigned to French language training at the Foreign Service Institute and was
                    sent to the Consulate General in Antwerp, Belgium, where, of course, the
                    Belgians were going through the French-Flemish “standoff.” If you spoke French
                    to the Flemish, they wouldn't even answer you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk a little bit about your first job, in the
                        “A” area. It sounds like such an uninspiring area to assign a young officer
                        with potential. Normally, the Department makes an effort to make the first
                        assignment interesting by sending you overseas, or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Not then. The Department was having trouble finding places to “park”
                    incoming junior officers.” The Department was bringing in classes of new Foreign
                    Service Officers every couple of months. This was done in an attempt to
                    “repopulate” the Foreign Service because it had expanding responsibilities, new
                    posts, and that kind of thing. However, the Foreign Service was still suffering
                    from the McCarthy era, when many people had left the service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that I mentioned that I came into the Foreign
                        Service in July, 1955. We were called “Class 1.” Obviously, there had been
                        A-100 classes before us, but there had been a long hiatus. This was just the
                        beginning, and everybody was looking at us. All of a sudden it seemed like a
                        “rebirth” of the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: By the time I entered the Foreign Service in August, 1957, I think that the
                    Department had sort of hit “flood tide” on people coming into the Service. They
                    were assigning us to just about any place available. Out of my class of 33
                    people only about half a dozen went right out to an overseas post. The effort
                    was to send a new officer overseas after one tour of duty in the Department,
                    which is what happened to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find this business of writing rules and
                        regulations? I would have thought that this would have been sort of a
                        duplicate of your Air Force experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, it was pretty dull, but there was an interesting bunch of characters
                    doing it. They were all officers from the middle grades on up. They were
                    “parked” there in the “A” area for some reason. Some of them had alcohol
                    problems and some were “cantankerous” and difficult to assign, but it was an
                    interesting bunch of people. It was great fun to be with them. My principal
                    project was rewriting and updating the Emergency and Evacuation Manual for the
                    State Department, drawing on the experiences of the Suez war in, I believe,
                    1956. An interesting aside on that work, when the draft was completed and
                    approved, I sent it forward for printing recommending a red cover. I was told in
                    no uncertain terms that was impossible, because red and pink were colors that
                    could not be used because of the communist witch hunt pushed by the
                    McCarthyites.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you pick up anything about the administrative function
                        that you later carried with you later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Oh, yes, quite a lot. Since we were working on the Foreign Service
                    Regulations, I found even years later that I knew more about the Foreign Service
                    Regulations than most other people did. Not that that really counted for much,
                    unless you're an Administrative Officer, but that's what they made me next.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Regarding this time you were in the Administrative area in
                        the Department of State, from 1957 to 1959?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Right. In the fall of 1959 I was assigned to French language training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did that last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Three months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you went to Antwerp in 1960?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I left Washington in November, 1959, on the SS UNITED STATES, bound for Le
                    Havre, France. Nobody had ever told us that you should avoid crossing the North
                    Atlantic Ocean in November of the year. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Antwerp from 1959 to 1961. What was your
                        assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I was first assigned as a Consular Officer, but they did a little shuffle
                    at the post and I wound up as Administrative Officer for the first year [1960].
                    Then I was assigned as the Passport Officer in the Consular Section for the
                    second year. That really was fascinating for me, because this was a time when
                    our passport and citizenship laws were such that they provided that a
                    naturalized citizen lost American nationality if he or she didn't lived in the
                    United States for “x” number of years after naturalization before going
                    overseas, and all that kind of thing. Along with Haifa, Israel, Antwerp had been
                    the center in Europe of the diamond trade. There were many, many Jews living in
                    Antwerp. When the Nazi-directed “holocaust” was descending on Europe, they
                    decamped to a third center of the diamond industry in the New World, in New
                    York. Many of them stayed in New York for five years, or long enough to be
                    naturalized as American citizens. Then they came back to Antwerp. There was an
                    effort made to try to “catch” people who had come back to Europe on a permanent
                    basis at that time, after naturalization in the United States. We called them
                    “passport citizens.” I always had a very uneasy feeling about that period
                    because our instructions were to pick up the United States passports of anybody
                    who had lived abroad for “x” number of years if they were presented at the
                    Consulate. Then the case would be adjudicated by the Department. I felt a great
                    sense of relief, years later, when that whole set of laws was “wiped out” by the
                    Supreme Court. People whose passports I had taken up could then get them back.
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was very difficult. I assume that the people in
                        Antwerp who were involved in this kind of situation would present
                        certificates from doctors that they couldn't leave, and that sort of
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Oh, yes. They would try to prove that they had been back to the U. S. and
                    this kind of thing, but there was no notation to this effect in their passports.
                    You remember, in the old days the immigration officials used to stamp entries
                    into the U. S. in your passports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about the Consulate General in
                        Antwerp?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>TICE: Yes. It had been one of our major Consulates in Europe because of the
                    events of World War II. When the invasion of Normandy took place [in June,
                    1944], there were two ports which were candidates for the huge movements of
                    incoming materials for the rest of the campaign in Europe. One was Rotterdam,
                    and the other one was Antwerp. The Allies didn't have enough anti-aircraft
                    defenses to cover both ports against the low level, “buzz bombs” fired by the
                    Germans. These were called “V-1” bombs [or “Vengeance weapons,” as the Germans
                    called them]. So the Allies concentrated anti-aircraft guns around Antwerp, the
                    more modern of the two ports, and it suffered only minor damage during the V-1
                    campaign. Lightly-defended Rotterdam was heavily damaged as a result. The result
                    of that decision was that Antwerp and Brussels were two of the “best defended”
                    cities in all of Europe. Even as late as late 1959 and 1960 Europe was still
                    pretty much in a recovery phase. However, Belgium, with less recovering to do
                    and the revenues created by having the only fully-functioning port in Northern
                    Europe, had the highest cost of living in Europe at that time. Although it was a
                    nice place to live, the “down side” was that a junior Foreign Service Officer
                    like myself found it hard to make ends meet. By that time I was making, I think,
                    about $4800 a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Consul General when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: That's another story. George Falconer Wilson had been Administrative
                    Assistant to Senator William Knowland [Republican, California], who was
                    Chairman, I think, of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in a
                    Republican-controlled Congress. Wilson was one of the “triumvirate” who came
                    into the State Department to “clean out the communists.” They included Scott e,
                    who “found” the “communists” as head of the Bureau of Security and Consular
                    Affairs; George Wilson, who was then Chief of Personnel and “fired” them, and
                    Frances Knight, Chief of the Passport Office, who kept them from traveling..</p>
                <p>Wilson had finally been “exiled” to Antwerp as Consul General. He was basically
                    not a “mean” person. He was just ideologically so far off to the Right that he
                    was a little “weird.” However, his wife was really “mean.” [Laughter] I remember
                    one time sitting in their house, drinking too much, and listening to them talk
                    about how Dean Rusk [then Secretary of State] was a communist. This was a
                    “disturbing” experience for a junior Foreign Service Officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>We survived two years at the Consulate General in Antwerp [1959-1962]. However,
                    the Department was still having trouble getting people assigned onward. I left
                    Antwerp with no onward assignment. I was told by the Department: “Well, go on
                    home leave, and we'll have an assignment for you at that time.” I repeated a
                    request that I had made before. I said that I came into the Foreign Service with
                    the idea of concentrating on Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. I made it
                    clear that that was what I wanted. I had a telephone call while I was on home
                    leave in Kansas in which the person who talked to me said: “Well, we have an
                    assignment for you. It's to the Consulate General in Montreal [Canada].” I was
                    again assigned as Administrative Officer. I said: “Well, all right, I'll go to
                    Montreal but if I don't get Eastern European or Russian language training in an
                    onward assignment following that, I'm going to resign.”</p>
                <p>What effect that had on anybody I had no idea. My comment probably went into the
                    personnel record. However, 18 months later I was sitting, fat, dumb, and happy
                    and having fun in Montreal, because it's a marvelous place to live. I got a
                    telephone call saying: “You have four weeks to finish up in Montreal and get
                    down to Washington for Bulgarian language training.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to go quickly back to Antwerp before we leave it.
                        Could you describe the political situation in Belgium from your perspective
                        and how you dealt with the Belgians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: This assignment was during the early days of the Flemish and French
                    cultural and particularly linguistic difficulties in Antwerp. I suppose that
                    Antwerp was about 80 percent Flemish, although I don't have at my fingertips the
                    statistics on the matter. Certainly, Antwerp was heavily Flemish, and there was
                    a lot of tension. The situation wasn't “nasty,” though there were occasional
                    demonstrations. You would hear a lot of snide remarks among the French about the
                    Flemish, who worked in most of the shops, stores, and that kind of thing. If you
                    spoke to them in French, they wouldn't respond or would respond in Flemish or
                    English, because they seemed always to be able to figure out that we were
                    Americans. They would rather speak English with us than French. I learned a
                    little Flemish, but not much. I had trouble practicing my French there. There
                    was a hidebound, holdout group of French speakers, composed of Walloons [French
                    speaking Belgians] and Francophiles.</p>
                <p>There was an organization called the American-Belgian Association which was sort
                    of the social center for many of the diplomats assigned to Antwerp. Not
                    surprisingly, it was very anti-Flemish and very much run by the Walloons. This
                    was quite an experience for my wife and myself because it was supposedly a “high
                    society pick-up joint.” [Laughter] Q: Did you have the feeling that the Consul
                    General and other senior officers were caught up in dealing with the “high
                    society” in Antwerp, which sort of absorbed the consular officers there? This
                    often happens when you get into one of these things.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>TICE: Yes. That was very much the case with the senior officers in the Consulate
                    General, who were part of the “elite” in the town. No question about that. To a
                    lesser degree, young couples in our Consulate General got invited to social
                    events in “high society” in Antwerp. It was a pleasant existence.</p>
                <p>We did have something called the Vice-Consular Corps, which, in effect, was
                    another club. Its members were all pretty hard-working consular officers who
                    were busily involved with the port and that kind of thing. That was where the
                    “real fun” was, because most of us were under 30. We had a lot of fun at the
                    monthly “bashes” at the Vice-Consular Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about problems with seamen and all of that? Did you
                        get involved with seamen's problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Very much so, signing them on and off and disciplinary problems on the
                    ships. There were also problems with indigent Americans coming through, looking
                    for “handouts” and that kind of thing. That was a good part of my activity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with seamen? Could you get the Belgian
                        authorities to help you do things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Oh, yes. Handling these matters was actually fairly simple because, if you
                    had a “beached” seaman on your hands, you didn't give him any money. We arranged
                    with the Scandinavian Seamen's Home, where it cost $0.75 a day for a seaman to
                    live until he got another ship. They had very strict rules. A seaman had to be
                    out of the Home at 8:00 AM and couldn't come back until 6:00 PM. He had to be in
                    by 9:00 PM. We had been able to set up a fund to cover this. I ponied up the
                    $0.75 a day to keep a seaman there but never gave them any money, because they
                    would just drink it up or take off on a spree. It was interesting work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any “protection and welfare” cases that
                        particularly come to mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: No really “wild” ones. During a fair part of my time doing consular work in
                    Antwerp, I was responsible for somebody in jail. The only “protection and
                    welfare” case that really gave me fits involved a prominent judge from Hawaii
                    and his wife, who were visiting Antwerp. He died unexpectedly. In his will he
                    had said that he wanted to be cremated, and his widow wanted to follow through
                    on that. However, there were no facilities for cremation in Belgium at the
                    time.. I had to make all the arrangements to send the body to Germany to be
                    cremated. We had the judge's widow on our hands for the several days that took.
                    She sort of became part of my family. We had lunch or dinner with her nearly
                    every day and persuaded others in the American community to give us a hand in
                    keeping her occupied and as content as could reasonably be expected. This was
                    sort of “what you did.” [Laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move on to Montreal. When were you in Montreal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: About 18 months, from January, 1961, to the summer of 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Again, I started out as Administrative Officer. I couldn't seem to “shake”
                    assignments like that because I knew something about the administration of the
                    Foreign Service. I did that kind of work for about nine months. Then, during the
                    remainder of my stay in Montreal, I again had the citizenship job. However, at
                    that time the Consulate General in Montreal was one of the biggest “visa mills”
                    in the Foreign Service. Everybody assigned there issued visas at one time or
                    another. While I had my own Citizenship Unit and that kind of thing, on rotation
                    I would go over and spend two hours a day working in the “visa mill.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Consul General in Montreal when you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: It was Jerome T. Gaspard. He had worked in the “Point Four” program in
                    Europe and then came into the regular Foreign Service under the “Wriston
                    Program” [lateral entry of civil servants into the Foreign Service in the
                    mid-1950's]. He was in Montreal as Consul General, I think, for three or four
                    years. Then he moved up to Quebec as Consul General, which was his “retirement
                    post.” He was Consul General in Quebec for a couple of more years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period, 1961-1963, what was the political
                        situation in Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: That's where I really got into political work for the first time. While I
                    was assigned as a consular officer, I had the great, good fortune to live in an
                    apartment house which was a short way down the hill from the Consulate General.
                    It was an easy, five-minute walk from my home to the office. It was on the main
                    street which goes over the top of Mount Royal.</p>
                <p>One day I was admiring a Ford Thunderbird which was parked next to my car in the
                    parking garage under the apartment building. I struck up a conversation with the
                    man who owned it. It turned out that he was the Member of Parliament for the
                    Mount Royal Riding [electoral district]. His name was Allan McNaughton. We
                    became good friends, although he was quite a lot older than I.. At that time he
                    a key figure in the election campaign of Lester [Jim] Pearson, the leader of the
                    Liberal Party, who was running against incumbent Prime Minister, John
                    Diefenbaker, the leader of the Conservative Party.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I got involved in that campaign because Allan McNaughton started using me as a
                    channel to get information down to Washington. U. S. policy at the time of the
                    election was “neutral,” but fairly clearly the Department wanted Jim Pearson to
                    win. However, the Department kept saying “dumb things” which made it more
                    difficult. McNaughton was using me as a channel to “pass the word” to the
                    Department. When he first asked me if I could serve in that capacity, I went to
                    Consul General Gaspard and asked him what I should do. He said: “Write up what
                    he tells you and send it down to the Department. I'll try to get somebody down
                    in Washington to pay attention to what you write up.” This process worked.</p>
                <p>During the final weeks of the campaign I remember an incident that at that that
                    related to the “DEW Line” [Distant Early Warning Line], a radar defense for the
                    United States, which was being built in Canada, with Canadian Government
                    permission. There was a supposedly “classified” Senate Committee hearing in
                    Washington on this subject. I seem to recall that a prominent figure in the U.
                    S. Government, I think that it was an Assistant Secretary of State, or somebody
                    like that, was testifying in favor of the construction of the DEW Line. This
                    person said to a critical Senator: “Do you want Soviet bombs to drop on us or do
                    you want Soviet bombers to be shot down and the bombs dropped in Canada? You
                    have a choice.”</p>
                <p>This comment was “leaked” to the press. Allan McNaughton called me up about this.
                    He was “howling mad.” He said: “What's the matter with those people [in
                    Washington]? They just can't seem to get it straight.” Nevertheless, I was able
                    to keep up this relationship with McNaughton during the whole time that we were
                    in Montreal.</p>
                <p>When Pearson won the election, McNaughton became Speaker of the Canadian House of
                    Commons. On a couple of occasions he invited us up, once when my mother-in-law
                    was visiting Montreal, to have dinner in his chambers, which was a very “royal”
                    kind of place. Before dinner we had drinks with him, and Allan had invited a
                    bunch of Canadian political types to dinner, too. I remember that Allan showed
                    my mother-in-law, who was then in her 60's, the dining room. She said: “Oh, my
                    goodness. Look at all of that cutlery! How will I know what to use first?” He
                    said: “You're going to sit by me. Watch me, and whatever I pick up, you pick up.
                    Don't worry about it.” [Laughter] He was really a very wonderful guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there in Montreal, although only as a
                        consular officer, did you sense any dislike of John Diefenbaker by official
                        Americans? Certainly, President Kennedy had an intense dislike of
                        Diefenbaker. Did you feel that dislike through the consular and diplomatic
                        establishment we had in Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>TICE: Yes. The Quebecers [residents of the Province of Quebec, in which Montreal
                    is located] tended to be Liberals and not Conservatives at that time and were
                    very much anti-Diefenbaker. The other political current was the beginning of the
                    Quebec separatist movement. Advocates of separatism for the Province of Quebec
                    were blowing up mailboxes in Montreal. There was an upper middle class, English
                    speaking enclave in Montreal, and one of the separatists' tactics was to drop
                    bombs in the mailboxes, causing shrapnel to spray the immediate area. So that
                    was going on.</p>
                <p>It was interesting that one of the people who was in our younger, social “set”
                    who circulated in the university circles and the Consular Corps was a man who
                    always dressed very dramatically and wore a cape. He was Pierre Elliot Trudeau
                    [a future Canadian Prime Minister]. He would always show up at these functions
                    accompanied by a beautiful young woman.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TICE: I don't recall it. If I was there at the time, it was not something that
                    affected us in Montreal.</p>
                <p>What did touch us, of course, was the Cuban Missile Crisis [October, 1962]. That
                    was the first time that I felt hostility toward the U. S. on the part of the
                    Canadians. Even then, the Canadians had this affinity for the Caribbean Sea and
                    Cuba. God knows, if I lived in Canada, I'd want to get to the Caribbean too, as
                    often as I could.</p>

                <p>TICE: Oh, yes. In social settings you would get into that kind of thing. At times
                    it was really “nasty.” The opposition of many Canadians to U. S. policy toward
                    Cuba was very heartfelt on their part. During the Cuban Missile Crisis there
                    were big demonstrations in front of the Consulate General in Montreal.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Side B of Tape 1 of an interview with Donald Tice.
                        Don, when you left Montreal, you went to study Bulgarian. When you asked for
                        Eastern European or Soviet language training, did you expect to be sent to
                        study Bulgarian? After all, Bulgaria is not only down South physically and
                        geographically but kind of “at the end of the line.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Having applied for Eastern European language training, when I hung up the
                    telephone after learning of my assignment to Bulgarian language training, the
                    first thing I did was to hunt up an atlas to see where Bulgaria was! [Laughter]
                    I guess that I had been thinking of Prague, Warsaw, or places like that. Anyhow,
                    both my wife and I did 10 months of Bulgarian language training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me. You studied Bulgarian. I studied Serbo-Croatian
                        at almost the same time, in 1961-1962.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: You must have had Father Milosevic [an Orthodox priest working as a
                    language instructor] as one of your teachers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering whether you got much from your teachers.
                        Actually, my teachers were Jankovic and Popovic. Larry Eagleburger [later
                        Ambassador to Yugoslavia and Secretary of State] was also in the class. If
                        we got nothing else out of that class, it was a feeling for the Serb mind
                        and mentality. How did you feel about it? Did you get something about the
                        Bulgarian outlook on the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>TICE: Oh, yes. We had only one teacher because studying Bulgarian involved a
                    really “small country syndrome.” Our teacher was a lady named Vera Graff. She
                    was a very bright, bubbly little lady. She was pleasant, well read, and knew
                    Bulgarian literature and that kind of thing. We got a feel from her for things
                    Bulgarian and Bulgarian ways of looking at things.</p>
                <p>There were only four of us in the class, one of whom was my wife. That was my
                    first wife, by the way. She died in 1989. She stuck out the whole 10 months with
                    me. The other students in the class included a USIA [United States Information
                    Agency] officer named Timothy Pfeiffer and another young Foreign Service Officer
                    named Bob Smith.</p>
                <p>When we got to Bulgaria, members of our Bulgarian class at the FSI [Foreign
                    Service Institute] made up about three-fifths of the staff of the Embassy in
                    Sofia. Actually, it was not an Embassy; it was a Legation, one of the last in
                    the Foreign Service. Anyhow, in the Legation Bob Smith was Political Officer, I
                    was Economic Officer, and Tim Pfeiffer was Public Affairs Officer. I still have
                    my Third Secretary of Legation identity card. The U. S. Mission in Sofia was the
                    last Legation we had. It was sort of a point of pride that I served in the last
                    U. S. Legation. In fact, I don't think the U.S. has Third Secretaries any
                    more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in Sofia, Bulgaria, from...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: We got there in the summer of 1964 and left in the summer of 1967. We took
                    home leave after 18 months in Sofia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the state of our relations with Bulgaria when you
                        went there in 1964, both in terms of what you learned in whatever area
                        studies you had and what you learned when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: U. S. relations with Bulgaria were formal and cold. At that time Bulgaria
                    was used by the Soviets as a kind of “trial balloon” agent. The Soviet
                    Ambassador in Sofia was referred to jokingly in the Diplomatic Corps as the
                    “Pro-Consul.” He was the “big man” in Sofia. Todor Zhivkov and all of his
                    lackeys obviously looked to the Kremlin to learn what they should do. So dealing
                    with the Bulgarians was cold and formal.</p>
                <p>The Bulgarian Minister of the Interior had been very well trained by the KGB
                    [Soviet secret police]. Ministry of the Interior agents were omnipresent. Our
                    houses and apartments, and most of us lived in apartments, were “bugged” to a
                    fare-thee-well. We had to assume that everything in the Legation was bugged.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Our Mission was and still is located in a little, store-front building in
                    downtown Sofia. Living and working there was tough. Supplies were hard to get.
                    You couldn't travel outside of Sofia without obtaining prior permission for the
                    trip. You had to give notice if you were going outside the city limits. Food,
                    even in the government run, Diplomatic Store, was not particularly what you
                    wanted. The variety of food was very limited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have turnip salad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, yogurt was big, turnips were big. Potatoes and onions generally were
                    unavailable near the end of the winter, and you really never saw green
                    vegetables, even in the summer, when they were producing loads of it in
                    Bulgaria. Much of their best produce, and meat, went to the Soviet Union. Green
                    vegetables and fruit also were being exported to the West for hard currency.
                    They came on the market in Bulgaria just enough ahead of the produce of the Po
                    Valley [in Italy] that the Bulgarians could sell them handily, send them out to
                    Western European markets out in big 18-wheelers marked “Bulgarplod,” which means
                    “Bulgarian fruit”. The best vegetables and fruits were always shipped to Moscow,
                    the rest went to Western Europe, and the Bulgarian public could buy them only at
                    peak production periods when the volume of the crops exceeded their ability to
                    ship them out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Minister while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Eugenie Anderson was. She was the first woman to be appointed a Chief of
                    Mission in a communist country. She was appointed by President John Kennedy. She
                    left Bulgaria in the spring of 1965, about six to eight months after I got
                    there.</p>
                <p>The next Minister was Nathaniel Davis, a career Foreign Service Officer who had
                    just come out of an assignment to the White House staff. Nat was in Sofia only a
                    year because he had a very unfortunate accident. He and his two small daughters
                    had gone out on a cold, winter, Sunday afternoon. to a hill in Sofia which kids
                    used to slide down. When his kids got cold he headed back for his residence with
                    them in his van. As he was going down a steep hill with an ice slick on it, the
                    van went out of control, went through an intersection, and smashed into a bus
                    stop. One person was killed, and a second, a child, was badly injured.</p>
                <p>The Bulgarians, of course, in their “kindly” way, saw this as an opportunity to
                    “extort” the Americans. So the Department pulled Nat out real fast. His DCM
                    [Deputy Chief of Mission], Tom Tuck, was an “experiment,” a USIA officer serving
                    as a DCM. This was back when USIA officers were considered by he Department not
                    as qualified as “real” FSOs. Tom Tuch of course was and is a highly accomplished
                    diplomat, and went on to be one of the eminent “gray beards” of USIA.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>We were very lucky when we lost Nat Davis that we had Tom Tuck as Charg�
                    d'Affaires, because it was nearly a year before a successor to Nat was
                    named.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a Soviet hand at that time, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, he had had experience in both the Soviet Union and in Germany. About
                    the time Tom Tuck was leaving, we finally had an Ambassador accredited to
                    Bulgaria, John [Jack] McSweeney. Jack was initially assigned to Bulgaria as
                    Minister, but he had been lobbying to have the position raised to the level of
                    Ambassador, and the Department accepted his recommendation. I think that he had
                    been Political Counselor and then DCM in the Embassy in Moscow. He was assigned
                    as DCM in Belgium at the time he was appointed Minister in Bulgaria. Then the
                    Department raised the office to the level of an Embassy. This had already been
                    done in Hungary, which had the only other American Legation in the world.</p>
                <p>That was one of the first times that I really got in a “swivet” with my
                    Ambassador, although this was certainly not the last time.. When Minister
                    McSweeney arrived in Sofia, he got us all together and said that he wanted to
                    have all of our opinions on whether or not the Legation should be made an
                    Embassy. When he came to me, I gave him rather a long and stern lecture on all
                    of the concessions that we should get from the Bulgarians, because they
                    considered it very important to have an American Embassy in Sofia at that point.
                    I listed all of the things which, in my view, we should first demand before our
                    Mission in Sofia was raised to be an Embassy.</p>
                <p>I realized that I was in trouble because Jack McSweeney is a big, florid
                    Irishman. The color on his face began to get redder and redder. He let me say my
                    piece, and when I finished, he rasped out a “Thank you very much,” and adjourned
                    the meeting. Then they announced a week later that the Department was raising
                    the Legation in Sofia to Embassy status. He had already known that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wanted to be an Ambassador, that's all. You have to
                        take that into consideration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, he wanted to be an Ambassador. McSweeney and I laughed about this
                    incident later, once we got to know each other better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Eugenie Anderson as Minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>TICE: She was quite good. She was very professional and very solicitous of the
                    Legation staff. She honestly wanted to try to take care of us. She lived in a
                    rather grand house (by comparison to most of our apartments), but at the same
                    comfort level as the rest of us in terms of the difficulty of getting supplies.
                    She had official functions there, and members of the staff were invited over to
                    her residence or were invited to dinner, for example, more or less as “family”
                    members. So we got to see some “civilization” that way.</p>
                <p>She was very “political.” She had always been, and that was why she was
                    appointed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hadn't she been Chairman or something like that of the
                        Democratic National Committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I think that she had been. I liked her. She was a very interesting person.
                    Her husband, John Anderson, had a family connection with the Kellogg breakfast
                    cereal company and was quite a wealthy person. This was how she had had the
                    money to get into the Hubert Humphrey [former Senator from Minnesota and Vice
                    President of the United States] circle and climb up in the Democratic Party.
                    Anderson lived in Sofia most of the time. He was a photographer. That was his
                    hobby and his avocation. He was a very pleasant man, always sort of in the
                    background.</p>
                <p>At one point there were several, anti-American riots in Sofia, and he went out to
                    take pictures of them. These took place near the Legation. Eugenie was
                    absolutely furious with him for putting himself in what was potentially “harm's
                    way.” I felt very uncomfortable being present when at the residence she was
                    really “dressing him down” for having taken those pictures. This was the
                    Ambassador talking to him. [Laughter].</p>

                <p>TICE: I dealt with this in two ways. One way was to read the newspapers. We read
                    all seven newspapers published every day. I can still rattle off their names. We
                    read “Politika” first. This was the Communist Party newspaper. What we read
                    there was repeated in all of the other newspapers. “Politika” material accounted
                    for about three-fourths of the contents of the other newspapers, although the
                    other papers also carried other material. There were papers for agricultural,
                    youth, labor, sports, arts, and the so-called Fatherland Front, which was the
                    organization designed to involve the general populace who were not members of
                    the communist party in social and political activities..</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I used the material in the press as the basis for my reporting. Generally, we
                    couldn't get appointments with officials in the economic ministries. They just
                    wouldn't talk to you. So I collected information by word of mouth, on the
                    cocktail circuit. There weren't very many Bulgarians at any of the social
                    functions we attended. I talked to everybody I could and, of course, got a lot
                    of “disinformation,” bad information, and that kind of thing in the process.</p>
                <p>My wife and I found ourselves in an interesting situation because we both were
                    fluent in Bulgarian and spoke fairly fluent French. We were invited to a lot of
                    functions that other diplomats, primarily accredited Ambassadors, were giving
                    because by and large these diplomats didn't speak Bulgarian. If they invited
                    Bulgarians, they would invite us because they would use us as language bridges,
                    speaking three languages [English, French, and Bulgarian]. This got us into a
                    lot of things that we wouldn't have been into otherwise. Most of the dinners
                    hosted by Ambassadors were black tie. I attended more black tie functions in
                    Sofia than did in the rest of my career put togetheThe “downside” of this was
                    that we had something going on almost every night. You've been at small posts
                    like that. It can be pretty deadly.</p>
                <p>In fact, about the time that we got there, the Diplomatic Corps in Sofia made an
                    agreement that there would be no official functions on Friday evenings,
                    Saturdays, or Sundays, unless there were a visiting dignitary, a national
                    holiday, or something like that involved or there was a date that couldn't be
                    avoided. However, in general and even so, people would avoid ordinary, “social
                    entertaining” on Friday evening, Saturday, or Sunday. That was a godsend,
                    because we had three nights “off” the social round.</p>
                <p>The best information could not be collected in Sofia. You got it outside of
                    Sofia, but you had to have a travel permit to leave Sofia. We traveled to some
                    extent on the basis of consular work. A lot of Bulgarians had emigrated to the
                    United States during the period between World War I and World War II. Many of
                    these people had retired, were elderly, and wanted to spend their final years in
                    their land or origin.. During both world wars, and particularly World War I,
                    there had been a lot of Bulgarians who had gone to the U. S. in the immigration
                    wave in the early part of the 20th century and had served in the U. S. Army and
                    were still alive when I was in Bulgaria. They had veterans' pensions, social
                    security rights, and that kind of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>There was a Treasury embargo on U.S. dollars going into Bulgaria, with a few
                    exceptions. Some of those exceptions concerned pensions for elderly people.
                    These recipients couldn't get these pensions, however, unless a Consular Officer
                    went out and certified the “bona fides” of the person who was the claimant, and
                    could give some kind of assurance that the recipient would actually have the
                    benefit of the money received.. That practice got us into all sorts of places
                    and all sorts of mischief. I spent as much time as I could traveling around
                    Bulgaria and confirming eligibility for pension checks. I generally traveled
                    with a Consular Officer. If the Consular Officer was not be able to go, I would
                    go in his stead since I was experienced in consular work. We had such a small
                    staff at the Legation that more than two people from the core substantive staff
                    (economic, political, consular) couldn't travel at one time. The language
                    officer at the British Embassy was fluent in Bulgarian, and he frequently
                    accompanied me and perhaps one other Legation officer on week-long trips to
                    visit places which we had arranged to visit.</p>
                <p>We had to filed our travel plans in advance with the Bulgarian authorities, and
                    it often took some while to receive approval of the itinerary. Once we got
                    outside of Sofia, it was a different world. I was talking one night to a drunken
                    young worker in a bar in a Danube River Valley town. I said to him: “Aren't you
                    afraid to be seen with us? You just pointed out to me that those guys over at
                    the next table are from the Secret Police.” He replied: “Well, about the worst
                    thing that they can do to you here is exile you from Sofia, and I don't live in
                    Sofia anyway.” [Laughter] We traveled and pretty well covered everything but the
                    specifically “denied” areas in that country, during one trip or another. We
                    would go into our hotel, go down to the front desk, and then ask the equivalent
                    of: “Where's the action?” They would always just tell us, right out, where the
                    cafes, restaurants, and other places were which students and young workers
                    patronized and where they got drunk every night. That was the way they lived,
                    like the Russians.</p>
                <p>When we would go to one of these places, we'd always have our “security tail”
                    with us. However, these security people were all local residents, and the people
                    just weren't afraid of them, as they would have been if the security people,
                    “the heavies,” had come from Sofia. We would set ourselves up at a table, order
                    some wine, and make conversation. We would end up feeding and providing drinks
                    to a whole bunch of youngsters. They were surprisingly well informed on what was
                    going on in terms of the internal politics of Bulgaria, and they'd tell you
                    about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>One of the oddest experiences I had in that regard was in a town called Vidin
                    [northwestern Bulgaria], on the Danube River.. On this particular trip we had to
                    look up birth records in a church. When we got to Vidin, we found the church and
                    church offices locked, and n inquiry were told that the Orthodox priest had been
                    “exiled” from the church for a long time, and could be found in the provincial
                    capital of Tirnovo. We sought him out, and he obtained permission to go with us
                    because we were going to verify a birth record, and, therefore, money would come
                    into the country later on. When we got into the car with him, he said: “Have you
                    heard about the attempted coup d'etat?” We said: “What are you talking about?”
                    He said: “This happened in Sofia. The Todorov Gorunya faction tried to throw
                    Zhivkov out of power.” He added: “One man was killed when he jumped off the top
                    of a building, in downtown Sofia.” I quickly got on the telephone and called the
                    Embassy. This was just becoming known in Sofia, when I telephoned. The “word”
                    travels quickly in a country like that.</p>
                <p>That was an experience, too, because I think that the church we visited with the
                    priest was built in the 12th century, part of it underground. There was a
                    beautiful “ikonostasis” [a grouping of ikons on a screen which separates the
                    alter area from the rest of the church] but some of the ikons were missing. The
                    priest said: “Oh, they've been in here again. If you boys want any ikons, why
                    don't you take them because the communists are just going to take all of the
                    rest of them away.” I thanked him but I said: “Father, but I couldn't and
                    wouldn't do that to your church. Also, that would get me thrown out of this
                    country in a flash.” [Laughter] He laughed. I thought it over, and decided that
                    we didn't know whether he was working for the communists. He had obviously been
                    “briefed” before talking to us. You had to assume that anybody you talked to
                    might be working for the communists. This partly underground church was really
                    eerie, going back so far into history. We had a lot of experiences like
                    that.</p>
                <p>We had another experience in Varna, a beach resort town [on the Black Sea]. At
                    that time the Bulgarians were offering very low cost tours to Varna. They were
                    ready to do anything to get “hard currency.” The main customers at the time were
                    Germans and Scandinavians staying at these lovely looking hotels, with a view
                    over these beautiful beaches. However, nothing worked at the hotels. Anyway, our
                    Defense Attach� had come down to Varna separately and brought his wife and the
                    wife of one of the guys I was traveling with. We decided that we would all go
                    out to dinner together. We had two cars, both of them big, black Ford station
                    wagons which were about twice as big as anything but the “Chaikas” [Soviet built
                    automobiles used for high-level officials] you normally saw there. When the
                    Defense Attach� pulled away from the hotel, he entered a traffic circle, which
                    was in the center of Varna. As he started around that circle his “tail” car
                    filled in behind him, I fell in behind that, and my “tail” car filled in behind
                    me. The Defense Attach� saw what was happening. He rolled down his window and
                    let out a “Texas Yell.” We just kept driving around and around the circle. There
                    were four “goons” [secret police] in each of the “tail” cars. We were all
                    laughing like hell. The people on the sidewalks were standing and applauding as
                    we went around and around. We could have gotten into trouble with that kind of
                    silliness.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes it just “bubbles” out. I take it that local
                        security operations were not as sophisticated as in the Soviet Union. When
                        you went out in the evening in the Soviet Union, you really had to be
                        worried about being “compromised,” and so forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: It was that way. We had a firm rule that we never traveled alone, for
                    example. I was involved in two incidents. In one case two other guys from the
                    Embassy and I were up on the Danube River, near the “Iron Gates,” the Zhelesny
                    Vrati, a big, hydroelectric project which involved Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania,
                    and Bulgaria. . We checked into our hotel and then went to an outdoor restaurant
                    right on the banks of the Danube River. We “collected” our usual crew of young
                    people who joined our table. Midway in the evening a guy joined us who insisted
                    on buying the wine for the table. We weren't paying much attention and didn't
                    look to see whether the wine came corked or not. It probably wouldn't have made
                    any difference. Anyway, it had been drugged. Fortunately, in this case at least,
                    I have a very “sensitive” stomach. I began to feel “queasy” and said to my two
                    companions: “They put something in the wine. Let's get up and get out of here.”
                    We paid up and started back to the hotel, which was a couple of hundred yards
                    away. I went over to the seawall along the Danube River and threw up. It hadn't
                    hit the other guys yet. We got down to the hotel, and then it got to the other
                    two. Because I had gotten rid of whatever it was early enough, I never passed
                    out. The other two did. We were vomiting and suffering from diarrhea. It was
                    obvious that, whatever they gave us, they did not want us to continue doing what
                    we were doing. By about 3:00 a.m. we were over the worst effects of the drug and
                    decided to “fix their wagon.” We quietly packed up our stuff, went downstairs,
                    out the front door, and took off, which left our “tail” cars trying their
                    damnedest to catch up with us. They were driving Soviet-made “Volgas,” which are
                    not good cars to drive over rough roads. We took a non-surfaced road from the
                    Iron Gates to the “Friendship Bridge” at Ruse, downriver on the Bulgarian
                    [southern] side of the Danube River. We “fed them dirt” all the way on these
                    non-surfaced roads. That kind of thing could also have gotten us into trouble.
                    We probably should have behaved a little better, but you get “bored” under all
                    of this pressure. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting. Exactly at the same time, I was in
                        Yugoslavia, just across the border and in another communist country. I was
                        there from 1962 to 1967. One of my great joys was taking off, by myself, to
                        deliver Social Security checks. I did this again and again. By contrast with
                        your experience, I didn't have any trouble at all. The Yugoslavs just
                        weren't playing that “game.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: American aid to Yugoslavia was flooding in at that time, and they weren't
                    going to do anything to halt it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always checked with the local police. If I were
                        traveling, for example, up in the hills of Bosnia, I would always go to a
                        police station and say: “I'm the American Consul. I'm looking for such and
                        such,” so they knew exactly what I was doing and they could report back in
                        to their superiors. I made quite sure that I wasn't surprising them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: It was a very different atmosphere. I was there in Yugoslavia from 1972 to
                    1975. However, the Bulgarians officials were mean and nasty. There were all
                    sorts of sexual compromise attempts on us. As a matter of fact, occasionally I
                    would be warned to be particularly careful about what I was doing and where I
                    was, and to have somebody with me all the time for a while. I would say: “What's
                    this about?” The person warning me would say: “I can't tell you in detail, but
                    just be alert.”</p>
                <p>The only other, nasty incident while I was in Bulgaria was at a trade fair in
                    1964. We had a U.S. pavilion there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this at Plovdiv?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, the Plovdiv trade fair. We used to joke that we could have put the
                    American flag over the front end of the pavilion and put one of our USIA [United
                    States Information Agency] employees, who was originally Russian, outside to
                    greet the people, and we would have gotten the biggest crowd at the fair, just
                    by being there. The Bulgarian people were very quiescent and subdued,
                    politically. However, they loved America. They would turn out for anything
                    American.</p>
                <p>The incident I mentioned happened one evening when I had to go back to my hotel
                    to get something. It was toward evening closing time, and when I came back in
                    though the main gate, a couple of the “goons” jumped me. I didn't fight back. I
                    just “took the fall” [i.e., let them beat me up]. They whacked me a few times
                    and then ran off. I went into the pavilion and told Minister Anderson, who
                    happened to be visiting at the time, what had happened. She immediately began to
                    raise all sorts of hell with the authorities.</p>
                <p>They were evidently looking for some American to precipitate an incident.
                    Following along behind me was a Serbian-American named Nick Lalic. He was with
                    the U. S. Department of Commerce trade fair organization. When Nick came through
                    the gate, the “goons” jumped him. Nick was about 6'4” and weighed about 280
                    pounds, or something like that. He just turned around and splattered one of the
                    “goons” against a wall and slugged the other one. Then they put the regular cops
                    on him and arrested him on a charge of precipitating an “incident.” They had
                    apparently hoped to try that with me. I hadn't been there very long and would
                    have been a good “catch” because I was a language officer. They could have PNGed
                    [declaring him “Persona Non Grata”] me early on in my tour. We had to get Nick
                    out of the country fast.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>The Bulgarians did that kind of thing. You just had to be careful. The listening
                    “bugs” in our apartment were obvious. On occasion, when it was quiet in the
                    apartment, the surveillance folks would turn up the gain on their microphones so
                    that they would be sure of not missing anything. When they did this, our French
                    poodle would bark and point at the nearest listening device. We knew from this
                    where they were — under the living room couch, under the dining room table, in
                    the den by the telephone, and under the bed in the master bedroom.
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your relations with the Bulgarian ministries? Did
                        you go to the ministries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Only rarely. You would have to request an appointment, and it might take a
                    week for them to agree to the meeting, if they agreed at all. Except for
                    Minister Anderson. She could generally get an appointment whenever she wanted
                    one. By and large, in the case of more junior people in our Embassy, the
                    Bulgarians just didn't want the top level of their ministries to be dealing with
                    Westerners. So it was very difficult to arrange an appointment.</p>
                <p>The only contact I had, which I was able to maintain over a period of time, was
                    with Academician Dashkelov, who was the head of the Bulgarian Academy of
                    Agricultural Sciences. I got to know him because I had asked for an appointment
                    to call on him about something or other. He apparently took a liking to me and
                    felt that he was pretty well insulated from communist “retaliation” for
                    anything, because he was a very eminent man. He was known as the “tomato
                    professor” because he had developed a strain of tomatoes which both tasted good
                    and were hearty enough to be transported over long distances.</p>
                <p>We had no agricultural attach� at the Legation, so I filled that function, and
                    any time I could find an excuse I called Academician Dashkelov at the Bulgarian
                    Academy. This relationship took a sad turn, however, when we had a visiting
                    agricultural attach� who was posted to Moscow. I was able to organize a buffet
                    dinner at my apartment, and I invited Dashkelov, the Academy's Chief of Protocol
                    (with whom arranged the event) and a couple of other Bulgarian officials. It was
                    the only time that I had Bulgarian officials in my apartment during the three
                    years that I was in Bulgaria. They just wouldn't accept my invitations. The sad
                    turn of events involved the Chief of Protocol, a lovely man and an opera buff. I
                    had a new German “Grundig” stereo set and a recent record of Boris Kristoff, a
                    renowned Bulgarian basso, singing excerpts from the great Russian operas. The
                    Chief of Protocol sat with tears running down his face he was so moved by the
                    beauty of the singing and so proud that it was a Bulgarian singing it. When he
                    left at the end of the evening he thanked me profusely giving him the
                    opportunity to hear the beautiful record. I never saw him again after that
                    party. He just disappeared. He was no longer Chief of Protocol. I've always felt
                    very sad about that because I'm very sure that his involvement in getting a
                    bunch of people from the Bulgarian Academy to attend this reception at my house
                    was responsible for whatever happened to him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as Economic/Agricultural Officer did you ever get
                        involved in “attar of roses” in Bulgaria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Oh, yes. High-level visitors always wanted to visit the “Rose Valley.” The
                    main thing that I would do, on the agricultural side, was crop reporting,
                    particularly on the bean crop. When beans were in short supply in other places,
                    there were “export opportunities” for USDA [U. S. Department of Agriculture]
                    sales of agricultural surpluses. The USDA wanted at one point to know what the
                    bean crop looked like in the Danube River Valley, on the Bulgarian side of the
                    Danube. So I called up the Agricultural Attach� in Belgrade, and would and asked
                    how I could predict the green bean crop. He said: “Look, don't even try. Go ask
                    a peasant how the crop is, how it compares to last year and the year before. and
                    how he thinks the bean crop is going to be this year. Take any information that
                    he gives you, and give it to me. Then I can predict the crop.” I said: “OKAY.”
                    And I had fun doing that.</p>
                <p>This led to one of the more amusing conversations that I had in Bulgaria. I had
                    parked my car by the side of the road when I saw a peasant working in a bean
                    field. I walked up to him, greeted him, and we chatted for a little bit. He
                    said: “Where did you get your funny Bulgarian accent?” I said: “Well, I'm not a
                    Bulgarian, I'm an American.” He just laughed and laughed, then said: “Well, your
                    parents must be Bulgarian.” I said: “No, I'm just an American. I learned
                    Bulgarian before coming here so that I could talk to people like you.” He
                    thought that was just amazing. Then I glanced up and saw that the “tail car”
                    [secret police] was parked about a quarter of a mile back. They weren't very
                    subtle. The “goons” were out of the car, walking around. I said to the peasant:
                    “Do you see that car? That's my secret police 'tail.' Are you going to get into
                    trouble for talking to me?” He said: “Oh, no. Those are local boys, and I know
                    them. They won't do anything to me.” So I got the information for green bean
                    production. That was the kind of encounters I had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Green beans were the life of that whole area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes. Another time we were on a trip and stopped in a little village whose
                    name was Krulina Voda, which means clear water. right near the Danube River. We
                    needed to contact a man who had served in an Ammunition Wagon Company of the
                    Pennsylvania National Guard during World War I. Sure enough, he rolled out this
                    long picture of the whole unit which he still had from the Great War. He pointed
                    out who he was and gave the names of a number of the others. He was quite
                    elderly.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>When we had pulled into this little village, we noticed that it had rutted
                    streets. You had to drive carefully or you would take off the undercarriage of
                    your car. There were chickens and livestock wandering around. There were few
                    signs of electrification. It was colder than hell. We stopped and asked somebody
                    where Gatzo so-and-so lived. He told us. Everybody knew everybody. So we went up
                    and spent some time interviewing this one-time soldier in the U. S. Army. While
                    we were talking to this man and looking at his documents, there was a knock on
                    the door. A man came in to join the conversation. The lady of the house
                    whispered to me: “It's the head of the communist party.” The communist leader
                    was very jovial and said: “It's an honor for us to have you Americans visiting
                    us. Why don't you come over to the town council building? We'd like to invite
                    you to have a drink and a cup of coffee with us.”</p>
                <p>We said: “Sure.” So, after we had completed the interview with the old man, we
                    went over to the town council building. The communist leader had a half dozen
                    men gathered there, including one old peasant in traditional peasant dress, with
                    the little fur hat and that kind of thing. He had been an original “Partizan”
                    fighting against one thing or another for years and years. Most of the other men
                    had also been “partisans.” We sat there in our overcoats for about two hours,
                    drinking coffee and “mastika,” the Bulgarian version of absinthe. As they say:
                    “Absinthe makes the heart grow fonder.” It was getting dark. They had the
                    windows open in this room, and it was colder than hell. The Legation officer I
                    was with, Bud Williams, and I agreed later that people had come in looking dour.
                    A young lady was serving the absinthe and coffee. She was unremarkable when we
                    walked in, but by the time we left two hours later, as we discussed the matter
                    later, she had begun to look rather pretty.</p>
                <p>When we got up to go, the communist leader, who was getting well into his cups,”
                    said: “Well, listen, boys.” He called us “boys,” because we were both in our
                    early '30s and looked awfully young to them, I guess. He said: “Look, you don't
                    want to go all the way back to Vratza (one of the provincial capitals.) He said:
                    “It's a cold night. Why don't you just stay here? We'll slaughter a pig and have
                    a pig roast and a really good time. You can sleep in one of the houses here. We
                    don't have a hotel.” We were well aware of the Bulgarian peasant custom, which
                    allegedly was still maintained in some of the villages, that when an honored
                    guest came into town, the visitor not only got a bed but also got the services
                    of the lady of the house, who slept with him. We did not figure that that would
                    look good on our records, particularly as we were dealing with the local
                    communist leader. We gave them many thanks, and begged off the invitation,
                    staggered to our car and drove off into the night.</p>
                <p>I probably had more fun during that tour in Bulgaria than I had in any other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure that that was true. I always look back on
                        Yugoslavia as being the “high point” of my career. Speaking of Yugoslavia,
                        could you say something about what you were gathering from your side of the
                        Yugoslav border about Yugoslavia in general and how it looked? Also, how
                        about the situation in Macedonia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>TICE: Well, that was a big issue while I was in the Legation in Sofia. If you
                    just mentioned Macedonia or said anything about Macedonia, they would declare
                    “Macedonia is Bulgarian.” They said that there was no difference between
                    Macedonia and Bulgaria. Well, we would say: “What about the language
                    difference?” They would say: “No, there is no difference in the language.” So
                    there was real tension between Bulgarians and Yugoslavs on that issue.</p>
                <p>The tensions this historical issue were heightened over a religious issue,
                    Bulgarians considered the Patriarch of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, with his
                    seat at Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia, to be the leader of the church in
                    Yugoslav Macedonia as well. There was a big fuss, therefore, when the Macedonian
                    Orthodox bishop of Skopje, the capital of the Macedonian Province in Yugoslavia,
                    was declared “autocephalous”, and therefore independent of the church in
                    Bulgaria. The Bulgarian communist government joined the Bulgarian Orthodox
                    Church in condemning what both saw as a Yugoslav attempt to further tighten
                    their complete control of Macedonia as well as weaken the Bulgarian claim that
                    “Macedonia is Bulgarian” Any Bulgar that you met resented what had happened.</p>
                <p>An amusing side note, which was true I believe in much of the Balkans, was the
                    continuing strong reaction to anything having to do with Turkey, harking back to
                    the Ottoman Turk 500-year occupation of the Balkans, until near the end of the
                    19th century. For example, when you talked to Bulgarians, you would often find
                    reason to say, regarding one thing or another: “Why do you do it this way?” The
                    Bulgarian to whom you were talking would look at you very sadly and say “Pet
                    stotine godini Turskoto Robstvo,” which translates as “500 years of the Turkish
                    yoke.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that they said the same thing in Yugoslavia.

                <p>TICE:</p>
                <p>In terms of Yugoslavia in general, since Yugoslavia under Tito was not a member
                    of the “COMINFORM” [Communist Information Association, the successor to the
                    “COMINTERN,” the Communist International Organization of the 1930's], the
                    Bulgarians did not look on Yugoslavia as a friend, because the Yugoslavs had
                    broken off communist party relations with the Soviet Union.</p>

                <p>TICE: Yes, as a part of the overall Warsaw Pact defense strategy, it was pointed
                    at the Greek and Turkish borders. The area near those borders was a “denied
                    area” to foreigners. The Rhodopa Mountains run all the way across the southern
                    part of Bulgaria. You could go up into the foothills of the Rhodopas on the
                    northern side, but the rest of the mountains, the southern slope down to the
                    Greek and Turkish borders, were considered a “defense territory” by the
                    Bulgarians and were closed. You even had to request permission, at least a week
                    ahead of time, to take a road which went from Sofia down through that area into
                    northern Greece and Salonika. The Bulgarian authorities did not want any

                    Pact plans. For example, Bulgaria was given a significant role in producing
                    electronics for Soviet as well as Bulgarian and other Warsaw Pact weaponry.
                    Bulgaria was among the more prosperous of the Eastern European countries because
                    the Soviets favored them in many ways, giving them roles and missions, both
                    militarily and otherwise. For example, they had Soviet help in building steel
                    mills. It was crazy for Bulgaria to have a steel mill, as Bulgarian iron ore had
                    a very high, sulfur content.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TICE: Relations with Turkey were bad. About 10 percent of the population of
                    Bulgaria at that time was of Turkish descent. Bulgaria had gone through a
                    process of making all people of Turkish descent change their names to Bulgarian
                    names. For example, you couldn't be “Ali Mohammed” any more. Your name had to be
                    something like “Petrovitch”. The Bulgarians treated their Turkish minority very
                    badly.</p>
                <p>An educated Bulgarian, part of the ruling “establishment” once said to me: “We
                    understand the problem that you have with the blacks in the United States,
                    because we have our Turks,” thus illustrating both his prejudice and
                    misunderstanding of American societIt was really the worst kind of racial
                    prejudice. Of course, this feeling against the Turks would crop up even after
                    the communists were thrown out of power in Bulgaria. That's anther sad story
                    that we should be able to get in the oral history program by talking with people
                    who served there when the communists fell, like Ken Hill who was the Ambassador
                    there at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of the conditions that you are talking about in
                        Bulgaria, in fact quite a few of the conditions, did not exist in
                        Yugoslavia. Yugoslavs could travel around the country, and even abroad,
                        relatively freely. If the crops were bad, particularly during the winter,
                        you did not eat very well, but that was because of the crops. It wasn't
                        because of government officials “confiscating” the crops. I would have
                        thought that there would be a certain amount of jealousy or a certain
                        “longing” to be able to live like the Yugoslavs. Did you find any of that,
                        or was there much information about the Yugoslavs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: There wasn't a lot of information. However, the trouble was that the
                    general populace nobody could not get a permit to go to Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia
                    was just “there,” and was a “semi-enemy” because it had broken communist party
                    relations with Moscow. At the time we arrived in Bulgaria, some people from our
                    Embassy went to Nis, in Serbia, to buy meat. This practice had tapered off a
                    little, but we went there a couple of times ourselves. Where they shopped in Nis
                    was just an open air meat market, but it was worthwhile going there because
                    frequently you couldn't find any meat in Bulgaria.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that when you went from Belgrade to Nis, you
                        were going down to the “lower depths.” We in the Embassy in Belgrade heard
                        of people from our Embassy in Sofia going to Nis, for heaven's sake, to do
                        their shopping! This was almost unbelievable!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I used to make people mad in the Embassy in Belgrade when I would go There.
                    They would ask the reason for my visit, and I would say: “I'm on R&amp;R” [Rest
                    and Recreation]. [Laughter] There was some unhappiness because we would buy
                    things in the Belgrade Commissary and run their supplies down. Of course, for my
                    sins, years later I got to be President of the Commissary in the Embassy in
                    Belgrade and I was trying to get supplies from the U. S. military bases up in
                    Italy. They didn't like us because we'd go into the commissaries in Italy like a
                    bunch of “thieving magpies” and clean out their best stocks. Then they'd be
                    short of supplies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Bulgarian relations with Romania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: There was the usual, feigned, communist “friendship,” but that's about all
                    it was. They didn't have much to do with each other. Of course, under what I
                    believe was the Treaty of Berlin, part of the Dobrudja area, the estuary of the
                    Danube into the Black Sea, had been taken away from the Bulgarians and given to
                    the Romanians, so there was a natural “tension” between the two countries built
                    in there.</p>
                <p>However, there was a little suspicion about them, because Georghiu Dej, the
                    Romanian party and state leader at that time, began to liberalize Romanian
                    foreign policy, and this became a minor irritation to Moscow-oriented Bulgaria.
                    The Romanians lived better than the Bulgarians. We would go up to Bucharest,
                    which even had a little, six-hole golf course at the Diplomatic Club.</p>
                <p>By the way, to go back to relations between Bulgaria and Greece, I don't think
                    that I talked about this aspect of it. The Bulgarians also felt that everything
                    in Thracian Greece, down to and including Salonika, all a part of ancient
                    Macedonia, was really Bulgarian territory. At the time I was in Bulgaria,
                    Macedonian was still spoken fairly commonly in northern Greece, once you went
                    outside of Salonika to the East. We would go to the island of Thasos in the
                    Greek islands for a vacation. On the waterfront in Thasos, the northern-most of
                    the Greek Aegean island, I could speak Bulgarian to the people, and they would
                    understand me perfectly and reply in Macedonian, which I could understand. I
                    doubt that's the case now, however, in a subsequent generation</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I recall correctly, and now I'm speaking from the
                        Yugoslav perspective, every once in a while linguistic conferences would be
                        held, which practically started a Third Balkan War. The argument would be
                        over Macedonian and whether it is a separate language or not.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>TICE: The Bulgarians would show up at any international conference, particularly
                    on linguistics, with “red eyes and fangs bared.” They would defend the view that
                    Macedonian was not a separate language. It was Bulgarian!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember once talking to the Greek Consul in Belgrade. I
                        mentioned that I spoke some Macedonian, because I used to go down there all
                        the time. I was told that I was crazy. The Greek Consul said that there was
                        no such thing as a Macedonian language. If you really wanted to get tempers
                        going in the Balkans, the definition of what constitutes a language is sure
                        to cause problems.Back to your elderly, Bulgarian veterans of the U. S. Army
                        during World War I, were they doing as my Montenegrin World War I veterans
                        did? They all seemed to end up with very, very young wives, by whom they had
                        children. I don't know whether they really were the fathers or what. We were
                        paying out children's benefits based on their service during World War I.
                        This was back in the 1960's.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I think that this practice was probably less prevalent in Bulgaria. I know
                    of a couple of cases where there were young children from such unions but I
                    don't recall that this was very prevalent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave your tour in Bulgaria, did the Vietnam War
                        intrude at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Absolutely, both in Sofia and in Yugoslavia in the 1970's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stick to Bulgaria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: In Sofia, very much so. There were at least two, destructive demonstrations
                    against our Embassy which had to do with Vietnam. We “boycotted” a lot of
                    Bulgarian national day events and speeches by Zhivkov and this kind of thing
                    because of the anti-American rhetoric. Ambassador McSweeney was particular avid
                    in his desire to make our displeasure known. He sometimes puzzled over whether
                    it was a greater insult not to go at all to such an event, or to go and walk out
                    when they started ranting and raving about the “imperialist United States.” A
                    third option was to send a Third Secretary, which was why I got to go to some of
                    those events! [Laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>On one occasion when Khrushchev visited Bulgaria, he made “unfavorable comments”
                    about the United States and Vietnam in his speech and McSweeney walked out. So
                    when Khrushchev was leaving Bulgaria the next day and all Chiefs of Mission were
                    invited to see him off at the airport, Ambassador McSweeney sent me instead of
                    going himself for the “send off” from the Diplomatic Corps. Of course, as a
                    Third Secretary of Legation, I wound up at the very tail end of the Diplomatic
                    Corps at the airport, right next to a wire fence. Within the wire fence
                    enclosure was a whole bunch of workers and peasants who had been rolled out to
                    say good-bye to Khrushchev. He came down the line, shaking hands with the
                    various ambassadors and barely nodded to the man at the end, in this case, me.
                    The peasant next to me, behind the wire fence, embraced Khrushchev, who kissed
                    him on the mouth!</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about foreign students in Bulgaria while you were
                        there? Did they play any role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes. There were many black African students there. There were some Arabs,
                    but more from the sub-Saharan African countries. I think that this was an
                    example of how racial prejudice worked in the communist world. Since Bulgaria
                    was at the bottom of the European communist “pecking order,” they got the black
                    African students. It was really very sad. These youngsters would come to Sofia
                    to go to the university without having even the equivalent of a fourth grade
                    education. The “lucky ones” had been to missionary schools and might have had
                    the equivalent of an eighth grade education. The Bulgarians packed the African
                    students into quarters where, they told us, the living conditions were poor. On
                    the other hand, they were given more money than the Bulgarian students who,
                    therefore, resented the Africans. There were displays of open, racist prejudice
                    by the Bulgarian kids toward the black Africans.</p>
                <p>This situation led me to send in an airgram to the Department of State one time,
                    when we still had airgrams as a reporting vehicle. I proposed that we should
                    take some of our money and pay for more African students to go to Bulgarian
                    schools because this would turn them sharply against communism. There actually
                    was a program, which was very “hush hush” at the time, of encouraging these
                    African kids to come in to see us. They could use our USIS [United States
                    Information Service] library. The USIS Library was on the ground floor of the
                    Legation, and it generally had more African students in it than anybody else.
                    While there, they could talk to our Consular or USIA Officers. If they looked
                    like reasonable candidates, we would pass their names along to USIA in
                    Washington. If they could get out of Bulgaria and go to Western Europe, there
                    was a whole operation run out of Munich to divert these students to schools in
                    the West — some to U. S., schools but also to schools in Western Europe.</p>

                <p>TICE: No, I think that they were principally directed against our Vietnam
                    policies. There had been, before I arrived in Sofia, a very destructive
                    demonstration at the Legation related to accusations that a former Bulgarian
                    diplomat, named Assen Geogiev was a U.S. spy. Georgiev had been assigned to the
                    UN in New York. When he came back to Bulgaria, the Bulgarian security
                    authorities arrested him and accused him of being a spy for the U. S. When he
                    was being tried in a classic “show trial” popular in that era they implicated a
                    Legation staff member, who they photographed in what they claimed was a
                    compromising situation having to do with Georgiev. That riot took place while I
                    was nearing the end of Bulgarian language training. Georgiev was executed, as
                    was, years later, a medical doctor whose services were frequently employed by
                    members of the Diplomatic Corps. After I had left Bulgaria, he was arrested and
                    executed. Too much contact with Westerners was not a good thing for anybody in
                    Bulgaria at that time.</p>

                    was the first and only occasion, up until recent times, when there was an

                <p>It wasn't that Todorov-Gorunya was a raging liberal. It's just that he was the
                    other, main guerrilla leader, a rival of Zhivkov's. He had been relegated to
                    living a quiet life in Vratza on the other side of the mountains. He and his
                    supporters tried to take over Bulgaria. They had a part of the Bulgarian Army
                    with them, and that sort of thing. It was more of a musical comedy sort of event
                    than anything else, but it was significant.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I think that Todorov-Gorunya was executed. Several other people, including
                    a couple of Army commanders, were sacked from their positions and jailed. One
                    guy reportedly threw himself off the top of a building about two blocks from the
                    American Legation. That was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Bulgaria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: In the summer of 1967.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TICE: There was some “saber rattling” and that kind of thing, and some ranting
                    about the “fascist Greeks,” but nothing serious. We traveled down to Greece
                    shortly after that and had no problem crossing the border.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a good time to go, in fact. The tourists had been
                        pretty well “flushed out” of Greece. I went down there right after that.
                        What about the Soviets? Did you get any feel from the people you talked to
                        about the attitude of the Bulgarians toward the Russians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes. This attitude is historic in origin. Sofia was the only Eastern
                    European capital under communism where they still had a statue of a Russian
                    czar. I think that it was of Nicholas I, “the Czar Liberator.” In 1878 Russian
                    troops came into Bulgaria and ran the Turks out. Even when I was in Bulgaria,
                    the Bulgarians still had very warm feelings toward the Russians because they had
                    liberated Bulgaria from the “Turkish Yoke”. They were considered “our Russian
                    big brothers.” Now, the Bulgarian youth were beginning to say that a little
                    snidely. However, if you talked to anybody over 40 years old, it was clear that
                    they felt this attachment to the Russians deeply. So the Russians weren't
                    “resented” in the same way that they were in other Eastern European
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stop at this point. We'll pick up the interview in

                        at the end of the tape.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: In the summer of 1967 I went back to Washington. I had applied for and been
                    awarded an American Political Science Association Fellowship in Congressional
                    Operations. So, in effect, I was detached from duty at the Department of State,
                    although I continued to be paid by the Department, and was placed went to the
                    Hill under the auspices of the American Political Science Association. During my
                    year there I working for Senator Chuck Percy [Republican, Illinois] and
                    Congressman Don Rumsfeld [Republican, Illinois].</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 11, 1997. Don, it was in 1967 that you went
                        to Capitol Hill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: It was in the late summer of 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did this “fellowship” or detail involve?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>TICE: The American Political Science Association had had this arrangement for a
                    number of years. It was primarily intended for people from the private sector,
                    academicians, and journalists. However, they then started adding a few
                    government people. The State Department was a late entrant in this program
                    because, as I can remember the climate at that time, Capitol Hill was not
                    considered a place that was “friendly” toward the State Department. Not that
                    that's changed a whole lot since then.</p>
                <p>Q: It was the time of the Vietnam War. TICE: I think that I was the third person
                    who went up to Capitol Hill under this program. Dick Moose was one of my
                    predecessors, as was Hume Horan. I may have been the third Department officer
                    under this program. When we were briefed at the beginning of the program, we
                    were told by representatives of the Civil Service Commission (the CSC was a
                    joint sponsor of the program for the Federal fellows) we were supposed to remain
                    “non political” but work half a year in the House of Representatives and half a
                    year in the Senate.</p>
                <p>Well, 1967 was a very “political” year. That was the year that Richard M. Nixon
                    was headed for the Republican presidential nomination. Nelson Rockefeller was
                    “on and off” about whether he was going to run. Senator Chuck Percy had made a
                    lot of noise as the junior Senator from Illinois, with the highest profile and a
                    deep voice. He also had presidential aspirations. On the Democratic side Hubert
                    Humphrey was Vice President of the United States and looking to run for
                    President. So it was a big year on Capitol Hill. I decided that if I really
                    wanted to enjoy this, I wanted to be attached to somebody who was going to be in
                    the middle of the “political game.”</p>
                <p>What people under this program did was to interview at various Congressional
                    offices. You had to find your own place. So I went to several Senators' offices,
                    but Senator Percy was the one I really wanted to work for. I ended up “landing”
                    a slot there. I worked for a while as an assistant to the Legislative Assistant
                    on Senator Percy's staff, and on to work Percy's speech writer, a young man
                    named Cal Fentress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Senator Percy operate, from your point of
                        view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: He was accessible to all of his staff. Many of the people on his staff were
                    from Illinois and had come to Washington with him. So they all had known each
                    other for a long time. For example, Fentress, had been a boy friend of the Percy
                    daughter who was murdered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Senator Percy had twin daughters, one of whom was
                        murdered.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes. The other daughter is now married to Senator Jay Rockefeller
                    [Democrat, West Virginia]. Cal was the son of the heir to the General Motors
                    Acceptance Corporation, so I guess that he didn't exactly have to work to earn
                    money. As we got into the presidential campaign of 1968, I would go along with
                    Senator Percy on activities which had anything to do with foreign policy. Then I
                    began to get into domestic policy, too. I remember that I began to be active
                    during the “encampment” up on the Mall that year connected with and the
                    so-called “March on Washington.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in conjunction with what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Let me start with Senator Percy's committee assignments in the Senate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I meant the “encampment.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Oh, I'm trying to remember. The “March on Washington” and the “encampment”
                    on the Mall were a combination of activities in connection with promoting “Civil
                    Rights” and welfare legislation. I remember that we went to a rally being held
                    by one of the “March” leaders in a church on Capitol Hill. Fentress, Senator
                    Percy, and I went to that because the person who had organized this rally was a
                    then little-known Chicagoans named Jesse Jackson. When riots took place in the
                    cities earlier that summer of 1968, Senator Percy had gone back to Chicago and
                    hooked up with Jesse Jackson, trying to do something to quell the riots there at
                    the time of the Democratic Party convention and to establish some kind of
                    “dialogue.” So Percy knew Jackson already. This was an interesting thing for a
                    Foreign Service Officer who had just come out of an overseas assignment really
                    to be “thrown into the maw” of American domestic politics, and I really liked
                    this experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that this “March on Washington” was also known as
                        “The Poor People's March.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, I think you're right. And, the encampment was called “Resurrection
                    Village”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in writing foreign policy speeches,
                        or what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Senator Percy was a fairly junior member of the Senate Foreign Relations
                    Committee. I worked on pretty general stuff.</p>
                <p>It was not until the second half of the year, when I left Senator Percy's office
                    to go over to the House of Representatives that I really got into the “guts” of
                    writing political speeches. It was kind of an interesting thing. I went over to
                    the House of Representatives for the second half of the Fellowship year,
                    interviewed with the Republican Congressman from my district, the First District
                    in Kansas, named Robert Dole. Then I also interviewed with Congressman Don
                    Rumsfeld [Republican, Illinois], as well as other members of the House. However,
                    Rumsfeld was the one I was really interested in because he was very highly
                    regarded as a young Congressman. Rumsfeld is almost exactly the same age as I
                    am. I think that he's two months younger than I. “Rummy” was very highly
                    regarded as a political strategist and tactician. He had friends on “both sides
                    of the aisle” [i.e., in both Republican and Democratic Parties]. He was one of
                    the planners behind the Nixon campaign. So I figured that all of this couldn't
                    be bad.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>So Rumsfeld “hired” me to join his staff, primarily to work on foreign policy
                    issues. Then, Congressman Dole went to see him and said: “Don, I wanted Tice to
                    write speeches for my Senate campaign. You 'stole' him.” So Rumsfeld said:
                    “Well, for as much time as you need him, I'll loan him back to you.”</p>
                <p>So, without my having any “say” in it, Don Rumsfeld called me in and said: “Bob
                    Dole wants you to write some speeches for him.” Dole's office was just down the
                    hall from Rumsfeld's office. I knew Congressman Dole somewhat. My parents were
                    active in his campaigns. My brother was his finance manager on one occasion in
                    one of the northern counties of Kansas.</p>
                <p>Dole tossed me a lot of material which his “hired gun” speechwriter had prepared
                    for him. He said: “Look at these and see what you think of them.” I read it all
                    through and went to Dole's “Public Relations” woman, Trudie Messerve. I said:
                    “Trudie, this stuff is no good.” She said: “That's what I've been telling him.
                    You go and tell him that.” So Dole said to me: “What do you think of it?” I
                    said: “It's crap.” He said: “Can you do any better?” I said: “Yes. Let's sit
                    down and talk about what the issues are that you're running on.” He said: “There
                    are really only three issues. There's foreign policy, the economy, and the riots
                    in the cities. Those are the three 'buzz words.'”</p>
                <p>So I sat down with Senator Percy's speeches and the resource material I had used
                    to prepare them. Cal Fentress and I had done speeches for Senator Percy on all
                    three of these issues. I basically wrote three speeches: one on the cities and
                    social welfare, one on foreign policy, and one on the economy. Then, since I
                    grew up in Kansas and knew the state and the kind of audience Dole would have, I
                    did a “matrix,” both geographically and in terms of the kinds of audiences he
                    would be addressing. That is, large cities as opposed to county seats and rural
                    area; audiences he would be speaking to - businessmen, Kiwanis Club members,
                    church groups, youth organizations, labor unions, etc. I numbered paragraphs on
                    the three separate speeches I had prepared on the three different issues. Then I
                    prepared a guide. That is, for this kind of audience, use paragraph such and
                    such from speech one, paragraph such and such from speech two, and paragraph
                    such and such from speech three. So, for a given occasion, he had a basic
                    speech. He always, of course, delivered these speeches pretty much on an “ad
                    lib” basis. He would remember them and most of the details but he spoke
                    extemporaneously most of the time. What I wrote gave him a guide on the things
                    he should address. I then went back working for Congressman Rumsfeld. Dole used
                    that approach pretty well through most of the campaign. My only recompense for
                    that was seeing in the magazine “Congressional Quarterly” after Dole had been
                    elected to the Senate, a reference to “Robert Dole, former arch-conservative,
                    now turned moderate and even liberal in some instances.” [Laughter] That was the
                    impact of the speeches I had written for him. However, I think that what I was
                    writing probably hit closer to Bob Dole's real philosophy than did the
                    perception of him as a “Right Winger” and I think that that is probably still
                    true despite allegations during the 1996 presidential campaign and all of that
                    kind of thing.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Congressman Rumsfeld? Dole ultimately became
                        Senate Majority Leader and Republican candidate for President in 1996. But
                        what about Rumsfeld? He was Chief of Staff at the White House, Secretary of
                        Defense, and Secretary General of NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization]
                        at one time or another. How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: He was a real “kick.” Rumsfeld was first elected to Congress in the
                    Thirteenth District in Illinois, which covered Winnetka, a northern suburb of
                    Chicago, The lady incumbent of that seat had represented the Thirteenth District
                    for some 20 years, and had decided to retire. or something like that. Rumsfeld
                    decided run for the Republican nomination, knowing full well that he would be
                    running for the Republican nomination against entrenched interests — the
                    Republican establishment already had designated their candidate.. Rumsfeld had
                    been a staffer in Congress and, before that, he was a Navy pilot so he was not
                    well known politically in the district.</p>
                <p>Don organized his New Trier High School classmates. I don't know if you're
                    familiar with New Trier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My brothers went to New Trier.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: It was one of the best high schools in the United States at that time and
                    probably still is. My wife went there, as a matter of fact. Anyway, Rumsfeld
                    organized his classmates and all of his friends from New Trier High School. With
                    a nearly zero budget, they set up “kaffeeklatsch” in all of their homes, and
                    their parents' homes, and the homes of their friends and their parents' friends,
                    throughout the Thirteenth District. That was basically his campaign, and he won.
                    Once he'd won the primary, he was a “shu in.” Then he had money behind him and
                    could put on a real campaign. He had strong support in his district and he kept
                    this going. As a matter of fact, on a couple of occasions I went back to his
                    district with him. His mother was still driving her “getting around” car, a very
                    beat up Volkswagen “Beetle,” which Don Rumsfeld had used during his campaign. It
                    was his trademark. We would hop into that “Beetle” and charge around. Every 30
                    minutes there would be another “kaffeeklatsch,” and there would be a full house
                    of people to meet and talk with him. There were more women than men at these
                    events, but a lot of men would also show up too. He'd talk for 15 or 20 minutes,
                    answer questions, and have a cup of coffee. Then we'd scoot out to the car and
                    go around the corner to the next place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in foreign affairs questions at this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>TICE: Yes. He was on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the House Committee
                    on Appropriations. This was a key committee for the funding of foreign affairs
                    activities. He had me do quite a lot of research on that, and prepare floor
                    statements, and that kind of thing. Any House or Senate staffer should be the
                    “invisible person,” and the convention was that it was always the Representative
                    or Senator who did things. That's changed a lot by now. I did a lot on foreign
                    affairs in that context. I also did some bits and pieces on domestic policy,
                    too.</p>
                <p>My “payoff” on the whole year came in 1968, near the end of my Fellowship year.
                    Senator Percy had told me before I left his staff: “If I decide to make a run
                    for President at the Republican Convention in Miami, I'd like you to go along on
                    my staff”. I said: “Well, OKAY, but I have to clear my skirts on that, first
                    with Don Rumsfeld.” Percy said: “I'll talk to Don.” So I said: “I also have to
                    talk with the State Department.” I went down to the State Department with the
                    intention of talking to Idar Rimestad, who was the Under Secretary for
                    Management at the time. I didn't get to see him, but I saw his Special
                    Assistant, whose name I can't remember. I explained the situation and said: “You
                    know, if I let the Senator pay my way down to Miami, it could be against the law
                    for me, as a Foreign Service Officer, to have somebody pay my way to work on a
                    political campaign.” Rimestad's Special Assistant said: “Okay, we'll cut orders
                    for you. We'll pay your per diem and your transportation down there.” I said:
                    “Well, I'm going to be in the middle of politics.” He said: “Just stay 'off
                    camera' and keep your head down. This is good experience for you, and we need
                    people who know how to deal with this kind of thing. As long as you are not
                    caught out there visibly, it will be all right.”</p>
                <p>So I did it and had a ball. Percy's strategy at the convention was to work for
                    Rockefeller's nomination, but at the same time position himself as a alternative
                    candidate if Rockefeller and Nixon deadlocked. However, Richard Nixon had a
                    steamroller going, and was nominated on the first ballot.. At that point, the
                    people on the Percy campaign worked with the Rockefeller forces trying to get
                    Percy nominated for vice president. When Nixon chose Maryland Governor Spiro
                    Agnew, some of the younger people on Percy's staff, most of whom were from
                    Chicago, and I got hooked up with the John Lindsay forces, trying to get a
                    band-wagon behind Lindsay to block the choice of Agnew..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean John Lindsay, the former Republican Mayor of New
                        York.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes. Lindsay, instead of Spiro Agnew, the Governor of Maryland. We lost in
                    both cases. However, I've always had a satisfying feeling that I was on the
                    “right side” of the issue, both in terms of Nixon, as presidential candidate,
                    and Agnew, as vice presidential candidate.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, Don, things have changed so much that one has the
                        feeling today that often much of foreign policy is dictated by Congress.
                        This is called “micromanagement,” in the sense that the Administration in
                        office is required by resolution or legislation to do this or that. Often
                        these dictations come more from Congressional staffs, who often have their
                        own, particular points of view, rather than from their principals, the
                        Congressmen or the Senators. Could you comment on your impression of
                        Congressional staffs during this period, 1967 to 1968?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, the Congressional staffs during that period were supposed to be
                    neither seen nor heard. The Staffs at that time were much smaller than they are
                    now. There were exceptions, the three most prominent ones being those of
                    Senators Percy, Bobby Kennedy [Democrat, New York] and of Ed Brooke [Republican,
                    Massachusetts]. Some of these staffers, particularly for Kennedy and Brooke,
                    became known personalities in their own right. Of course, on the Committee
                    staffs there were people who were well known, like Carl Marcy, but they were
                    virtual “institutions.” Otherwise, Congressional staffers kept a pretty “low
                    profile.” Senator Percy tried to keep his staff profile low, although he had a
                    big staff.</p>
                <p>However, there wasn't this abomination then which is now called the “Staff Del”
                    [Congressional staff delegation] where you have Congressional staffers who go on
                    taxpayer-funded fact-finding trips acting as if they were Members or Senators,
                    and demanding all the same perks as if they were. I encountered plenty of those
                    later when I was an arms control negotiator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left this Congressional detail in 1968. Where did you
                        go next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I was assigned as Special Assistant to the Director General of the Foreign
                    Service and to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Personnel, in the State
                    Department. At that time the Director General was John Steeves, and the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary for Personnel was Howard Mace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You held this position from 1968 until...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about the two people you
                        mentioned, John Steeves and Howard Mace? Could you talk about each one of
                        those at that time, what the Director General and the Chief of Personnel
                        did? Then we can talk about your duties.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>TICE: OKAY. At that time the Director General of the Foreign Service, while seen
                    by many as almost a “ceremonial” figure, had a significant amount of say over
                    what happened in the career service. He directly supervised the Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Personnel, Howard Mace, who managed the day-by day
                    operations of the personnel system.. However, John Steeves got into operational
                    matters only to a small extent.</p>
                <p>As Director General, Steeves interviewed all of the Ambassadors who passed
                    through the Department or were going out to their posts, and so forth. He
                    represented the State Department as a former Ambassador and as the Director
                    General on many occasions. However, where Steeves had real influence was in the
                    selection of Ambassadors and other high-level personnel in the Department and
                    Foreign Service. These selections, or at least the people put forward by the
                    career service for positions, were made by a small group of senior officers,
                    former Ambassadors generally, under Director General Steeves' chairmanship. It
                    was sort of an old-boys' club, and was so viewed by many.</p>
                <p>However, winds of change were already blowing in the Department, in good measure
                    generated by the events in Vietnam</p>
                <p>For example, Steeves chaired a group which considered any disciplinary measures
                    that came up. It consisted at the time Howard Mace, Ed Lyerly - the Deputy Legal
                    Adviser for Administration, the Director of the Office of Medical Services, and
                    the Assistant Secretary in charge of Security. I used to sit in on meetings of
                    this group as the note taker and reporter and I observed the interaction of
                    these people and how things were going. This was an interesting period in that
                    regard because this was when Foreign Service Officers, you might say, began to
                    realize that they actually had “rights.” The way the Foreign Service had worked
                    up until that time was that if someone, he or she, and most of the time, he,
                    didn't want to go to a particular post, he would be offered a last chance to go
                    to that post or resign from the Foreign Service. And he would resign, if he
                    really didn't want to go to that post.</p>
                <p>And, when a Foreign Service Officer wanted to get married...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To a foreign national.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: To a foreign national, he submitted the required application for permission
                    to marry, along with his resignation. One or the other was then approved. I said
                    “he”, because there were few women in the Foreign Service, a married woman could
                    not be appointed a Foreign Service Officer, and a single female FSO who married
                    had to resign her commission.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>Those rules began to be challenged during the period I was there, and the
                    frustration on the part of the Board of the Foreign Service, members of which
                    were from the “old Foreign Service,” over the changes were very obvious. And, of
                    course, this was the time of the Vietnam War. This was the time when President
                    Lyndon Johnson made the decision to “force” Foreign Service Officers to accept
                    assignment to the CORDS [Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support]
                    office in Vietnam. The Department had asked for volunteers for such assignments
                    and had run through all of them. The Department had looked for volunteers in the
                    other, civilian agencies of the U. S. Government, but that well had run dry. The
                    Department was running out of people to be assigned to CORDS/Vietnam. At that
                    point, by direction from the White House, a successful candidate for appointment
                    to the Foreign Service could not be appointed unless he agreed to spend his
                    first tour of duty in Vietnamese language training and then a year or more in
                    CORDS/Vietnam.</p>
                <p>This ruling was eventually overturned, but not before a significant percentage of
                    the junior foreign service had served in CORDS. It was a pretty “defining” in
                    the Foreign Service. What it did, and I think that a lot of people may not even
                    realize this, is that this practice built a kind of “Mafia” of people who served
                    in CORDS, both voluntarily and involuntarily (if they wanted to get into the
                    Foreign Service) These officers, with their common experience “hung together”
                    and have been sitting on these...</p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Side B of Tape 2 of the interview with Donald
                        Tice. Don, you were saying that the group of officers who served in Vietnam
                        was a tight-knit club.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: It was a tight-knit club. The members “stood up” for each other. It turned
                    out that this was not good for the Foreign Service in the sense that many
                    people, who would have come into the Foreign Service, declined to go to Vietnam,
                    and we “lost” them. Many others came into the Foreign Service and went on to
                    Vietnam. Then, as they saw it, a year or 18 months later, other people came into
                    the Foreign Service but did not have to go to Vietnam. These people then “turned
                    on the Department” and caused a lot of turmoil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you actually see the “forced assignment” of people to
                        Vietnam at that time? I'm not talking about people who were just coming into
                        the Foreign Service but who were at a more senior or “mid career” level. Was
                        this really an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>TICE: I wouldn't say that they were “forced” to serve in Vietnam. They were
                    “pressured” to do so. Depending on the level, say, below the level of FSO-3,
                    which is now FSO-1 in the newer system, there was a lot of resistance on the
                    part of people who had small children, and this kind of thing. They were being
                    asked or “pressured” to go into a war zone. At the FSO-3 level it was a little
                    different because this was an opportunity to go to Vietnam and serve as a
                    Province Senior Adviser, have your own helicopter, your own platoon guarding
                    you, and that kind of thing. This could be “fun stuff” at the command level.
                    There was a difference there, depending on what level you were at.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any extensive opposition to service in
                        Vietnam on the part of other Foreign Service Officers? Well, there was the
                        “open letter” to the President signed by some 50 Foreign Service Officers
                        protesting the Cambodian “incursion” in 1970. Were you aware of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, I was just leaving that job in the Director General's office at the
                    time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the spring of 1970 there was the “incursion” into

                <p>TICE: That is precisely what I was thinking of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe what you saw and how that played out,

                </p>
                <p>TICE: From my perspective there appeared to be a lot of officers opposed to that
                    action in the Foreign Service, including some people that I knew. In fact, at
                    the time, I was “Co-Chairman,” along with David Bilchik, of the organization of
                    younger Foreign Service Officers called the Open Forum Panel (OFP), which had
                    been formed in the latter part of the Johnson Administration and then flourished
                    under the tutelage of Elliot Richardson, who came in as Deputy Secretary.</p>
                <p>The OFP was the organization set up to try to get policy thinking and ideas to
                    the top of the State Department, without their being “beaten to death” along the
                    way. In this day of dissent channels and all that, which were outgrowths, by the
                    way, of the OFP, it is hard to remember the degree to which policy ideas created
                    down in the bureaus by more junior officers rarely saw the light of day. Bill
                    Luers was one of the key people who started that. David Bilchik and I were the
                    Co-Chairmen of it at the time of the Cambodian “incursion” in the spring of
                    1970. At that time I was on a week's trip as a member of a BEX [Board of

                <p>When I returned to Washington, the “Open Forum” panel was basically split. One
                    faction, led by David Bilchik, said that we should oppose the Cambodian
                    “incursion” as a matter of principle and oppose the Secretary of State. I was
                    the leader of the other faction. My feeling was that we could be more effective
                    if we didn't break with the Secretary of State and worked within the system.
                    Bilchik “won,” and I went off to be Yugoslav Desk Officer and backed out of the
                    controversy at that point. Yes, the Vietnam War was a very tendentious
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Howard Mace was the Director of Personnel? Was he under
                        the Director General, John Steeves?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes. In fact, he reported to Steeves, but he reported to Idar Rimestad, the
                    Deputy Under Secretary for Management. Basically, Idar tried to “ignore” John
                    Steeves, which created a rather tense situation at the top of the Administrative
                    pyramid</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your perspective, could you talk a bit about
                        Rimestad? He was one of those figures about whom people have rather strong
                        opinions. How did you see him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: It depends on what you want from an Under Secretary for Management. If you
                    want an Under Secretary for Management who was “totally wired into” the Congress
                    and who could go up to Capitol Hill and “cut a deal” with Committee chairmen,
                    Rimestad was your man. If the deal which he cut with the Committee chairmen and
                    the ranking minority figures on those committees was the deal which you got, I
                    would say that Rimestad was a superb Under Secretary for Management. True, he
                    may have cut some deals that we didn't want. However, we didn't then have the
                    kinds of “raids” on State Department funding and the kind of “free lancing”
                    activities that you now have on the part of individual Senators and Congressmen
                    who “screw up” the State Department because they can willfully do things. He
                    displayed solid leadership before his time, and there were a lot of people who
                    thought that he was very good.</p>
                <p>Yes, I know that there were a lot of people who didn't like Rimestad. He had a
                    kind of rough and gruff manner, but with Idar Rimestad you got what you paid
                    for. With him in office you got the Department fully funded and Congress off our
                    backs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Personnel, did you see any reflection of a desire to

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>TICE: There was some “push” on this, but not a lot. It wasn't a big issue. At
                    that time the Department started to go out and recruit and get people from
                    minority groups to take the Foreign Service written exam. However, at the time
                    the Foreign Service hadn't yet been altered in ways which took societal
                    experience into account in terms of how you judge people. The Foreign Service
                    was still pretty much a male, Caucasian group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to Vietnam, were we getting very many resignations

                </p>
                <p>TICE: There were some resignations, but there was no “wave” of them. However,
                    there were individual resignations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the Cambodian “incursion” in 1970 a group of
                        essentially junior officers signed an letter to Secretary of State Rusk
                        which was “leaked” to the press, protesting our military operations in
                        Cambodia. According to some accounts, President Nixon was “livid” about this
                        and said: “Fire all of them.” Secretary of State Rusk sort of “hid them
                        away.” Did you get involved in any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Personnel, how about issues of “justice”? I put it this
                        way because, when somebody is accused of something, often in the government
                        there is a tendency to believe the accusation. It almost seems to be easier
                        for the government to avoid looking at all of the facts and simply “ease”
                        the person out of the Foreign Service and so get rid of the problem. Did you
                        see any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: No, not really. My recollection is that both John Steeves and Howard Mace,
                    who were at the top of the Foreign Service, were “honorable men.” In fact, if I
                    recall anything, it is some instances of quite the opposite. For example, when
                    someone was “unfairly treated,” they would try to get them out of the post where
                    they weren't getting a “fair shake” or their job was taken away. John Steeves
                    and Howard Mace tried to “get them away” from the source of the problem and give
                    them another chance in a different context. That was the way that kind of thing
                    seemed to be treated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1970 where did you move?</hi>

                <p>TICE: I was moved to the Yugoslav Desk.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TICE: 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Yugoslavia during the period
                        1970-1972?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Tito was still riding high. Of course in the late 1940's he had made his
                    break with Stalin. There had been a decade of U. S. aid to Yugoslavia. The
                    Yugoslav economy was good and improving. Yugoslavia had a sort of
                    “semi-convertible” currency. Most Yugoslavs could get passports and travel to
                    the West without any problems. So Yugoslavia acted in many ways like a Western
                    country. At the time the interest of the Nixon administration was to try to see
                    what they could do to “bolster” the arrangements which Tito had put in place so
                    that Titoism would survive Tito. For example, that was one of the things that I
                    got involved in when I was on the Yugoslav Desk. A request had come down from
                    the NSC [National Security Council] for recommendations on what the United
                    States Government could do to improve the chances for stability in the Balkans
                    after Tito passed from the scene.</p>
                <p>I had made several trips out to Yugoslavia and was monitoring all the reporting
                    traffic, so I was fairly conversant with what was happening there. We knew that
                    there was real resentment in Yugoslavia on the part of the Bosnians and Slovenes
                    because we had closed Consulates in Sarajevo and in Ljubljana. So the Yugoslav
                    desk officer in USIA [United States Information Agency], Bruce Jackson, another
                    middle grade officer, and I sat down and discussed this issue. We came up with
                    the idea of putting USIS [United States Information Service] offices in each of
                    the capitals of the Federation of Yugoslavia. This would include offices in
                    Skopje in Macedonia, Titograd in Montenegro, Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
                    Ljubljana in Slovenia, and Novi Sad in the Voivodina, and Pristina in the
                    Kosovo. We already had a good, separately housed (from the Embassy Chancery)
                    USIS center in the heart of the university area in Belgrade, and co-located with
                    our Consulate General in Zagreb.</p>
                <p>So we wrote up a recommendation to this effect. It really was a case of the “man
                    with a memo” theory making policy. That memo went whistling right through the
                    bureaucratic layers in State and on to the NSC. The first thing I knew was that
                    I had USIA “mad” at me because suddenly, by White House “fiat,” their budget was
                    being drawn on to fund the opening of additional USIS centers in Yugoslavia.
                    This happened during the first year I was on the Yugoslav desk. By the time I
                    left there at the end of two years, we had already opened the first additional
                    USIS center in Sarajevo. I left the desk and went to Belgrade as Political
                    Counselor. During my tour there, we installed Centers in Ljubljana and Skopje,
                    and plans were progressing for Titograd. The centers in Pristina and Novi Sad
                    were put on hold because of questions raised about their somewhat different
                    status as “semi autonomous” parts of the Republic of Serbia.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>The whole thrust of U. S. policy was how could we make sure that Yugoslavia would
                    not fall apart when Tito died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to say that at one point George Kennan, while he
                        was Ambassador to Yugoslavia, asked me, as the chief of the Consular Section
                        in Belgrade, for my views on whether we should close the Consulate in
                        Sarajevo. I said: “Well, from the purely consular point of view, why not?”
                        So he closed the Consulate in Sarajevo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: So you “undid” my work! [Laughter] Well, my comment would be: “So, now
                    we've got Embassies in other countries, all over the place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time that you were on the Yugoslav desk, this
                        was still fairly early on during Nixon's first term as President. Nixon was
                        certainly a creature of California politics. What about the Artukovic case?
                        Did that case come up at all while you were on the Yugoslav desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: No. That came later, although of course there was ongoing agitation on the
                    part of �migr� groups, especially Serbians, to have him extradited to Yugoslavia
                    for prosecutionQ: Explain who he was...</p>
                <p>TICE: Artukovic had been the Minister of the Interior of the fascist, Ustashi
                    regime, a Nazi, “puppet” dictatorship in Croatia during World War II.
                    Pavelic...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that Pavelic was the “Prime Minister” of the
                        Ustashi regime. Artukovic was the “Heinrich Himmler” [head of the Gestapo in
                        Germany during World War II] of Croatia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Artukovic was a “mass murderer.” There's no question about that. He learned
                    from the Nazis the techniques that enabled him to kill more people, more
                    quickly. It wasn't just Jews, either. There weren't enough of them in Croatia to
                    make it worthwhile. Mainly, it was Serbs that Artukovic arranged to have killed.
                    The Pavelic regime was a Croatian, anti-Serb dictatorship, which is something
                    which a lot of American people who look at this period do not understand. These
                    Americans tend to say: “Oh, well, aren't the Croatians the 'good guys' and the
                    Serbs the 'bad guys?'” It just ain't that simple.</p>
                <p>Now what was the thrust of your question?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Efforts had been made, from time to time, to send
                        Artukovic back to Yugoslavia to be tried. Artukovic was “protected” because
                        he was the brother of a wealthy, Republican contractor in California. This
                        has always been a point of contention in Yugoslav-American relations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>TICE: Artukovic wasn't extradited to Yugoslavia until a number of years later.
                    However, this issue wasn't really “ticking over” during my time on the Yugoslav
                    desk.</p>
                <p>The problems which I got into and which were “ticking over” involved two groups
                    in the United States which were always making “demarches” on the Yugoslav desk
                    officer in the State Department. One of them, obviously, was the old “Ustashi”
                    faction centered primarily around Cincinnati, OH.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were a lot of Croatians in Cincinnati. Was Senator
                        Frank Lausche [Republican, OH] still around? He had a Croatian or Slovenian
                        background, I'm not sure which.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I think that Senator Lausche was of Croatian ancestry.</p>
                <p>The other Yugoslav group consisted of the old “Chetnik” faction of Right Wing
                    Serbs, which was centered mainly in Chicago. For the Yugoslav desk officer, it
                    was a “damned if you do” and “damned if you don't” situation. For example, for
                    years many of the mayors of cities all over the United States had been persuaded
                    by Croatians living in the U. S. to issue declarations in favor of Croatia and
                    flying the Croatian flag over city halls or governor's mansions on May 10, which
                    was “Ustashi Day,” Tito's Government and Embassy in Washington was giving the
                    State Department “fits” about that.</p>
                <p>I had a list of all of the mayors and governors who had agreed to Croatian
                    requests to honor the May 10 holiday. I wrote a letter to them, as Yugoslav desk
                    officer, cleared it through the Office of the Legal Adviser in the State
                    Department, and also had it cleared by the Assistant Secretary of State for
                    European Affairs. The letter said, more or less:</p>
                <p>“Dear Mr. Mayor: Far be it from me to tell you what you should do and whom you
                    should honor in your city. However, you might want to consider whether taking
                    part in celebrations which have the appearance, at least, of celebrating a
                    fascist dictatorship which was involved in genocide during World War II. You may
                    not want to do that.”</p>
                <p>Well, I had stunning success. The Mayors of Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and Los
                    Angeles, to name the “big ones,” all declined to take part in the following
                    year's celebration of “Ustashi Day.” I had some gun-carrying Ustashi in front of
                    my desk within a matter of days after I sent that letter out. The letter made
                    the papers, and there was a big hullabaloo. Everybody was running for cover, and
                    Congressmen were pontificating on the matter. To the Department's credit, they
                    protected me on the letter and didn't give an inch on it. The Department could
                    have “fed me to the wolves” on this issue, if they'd wanted to. [Laughter]</p>

                    Ambassador to Yugoslavia about six months after I went on the Yugoslav desk, I
                    think. I don't remember exactly. He had been Ambassador to Yugoslavia for nearly

                <p>TICE: No, but I was aware of it. After the “blow up,” following which Tom Enders
                    left Belgrade, I was on a visit to Yugoslavia, and Ambassador Leonhart seemed to
                    have the air of being “embattled.” He left Belgrade not long after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how the Embassy in Belgrade
                        and the Consulate General in Zagreb kept you informed through their
                        reporting and so forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: The reporting was good. Both offices were very active. The Consulate
                    General in Zagreb at one point had “gotten a little bit out in front of the
                    Embassy,” not from my point of view but from the point of view of Ambassador
                    Toon. In 1971, I guess it was, there was a political “upheaval” in Zagreb, a
                    belated sort of “Prague Spring” kind of thing. [A reference to the uprising in
                    Prague, Czechoslovakia, in May, 1968, which the Soviets ultimately put down by
                    force.] The Croatians were not really badly off, but politically Yugoslavia was
                    still a communist country, even though it was relatively “free.” We had some
                    young Political Officers who got very much involved in reporting, based on what
                    the “anti-Tito types” were doing in Croatia. This caused some unhappiness in
                    Belgrade because the interpretation of these events was somewhat different from
                    the two posts.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>I remember that when Ambassador Toon was getting read into the situation in
                    Belgrade, he was “livid” because this reporting was going directly to the
                    Department from the Consulate General in Zagreb, without first going through the
                    Embassy in Belgrade. The Embassy was just getting information copies of this
                    reporting. When Toon went out to Belgrade, one of the first things that he did
                    was to order all reporting from the Consulate General in Zagreb to go through
                    the Embassy in Belgrade before going to the Department. However, I think that,
                    by and large, the Political Officers in Zagreb were doing a good job. My
                    predecessor as Political Counselor in Belgrade was Clayton Mudd. Clayton had
                    been in Yugoslavia as an OSS [Office of Strategic Services, a foreign
                    intelligence agency during World War II] officer during World War II. At the end
                    of World War II he was up in Trieste, Italy. He apparently had a few “flies” on
                    him which bothered some people but he knew Serbo-Croat and he knew people...</p>

                        arrived in Belgrade in 1972? By the way, you were in Belgrade from 1972
                        to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: 1975. In 1975 I was assigned to the National War College.</p>
                <p>Regarding the political situation in Yugoslavia in 1972, it seemed “stable.” Even
                    in retrospect, it would be hard to say that we should have spotted what was to
                    come, although I would have to say in hind-sight that we should have anticipated
                    it. Tensions were beginning to be apparent over the transfer of wealth from the
                    North to the South of Yugoslavia. That is, Croatia and Slovenia were the two
                    “wealthiest” of the Yugoslav republics. Serbia was somewhere in between.
                    Voivodina was as wealthy as Slovenia but always a little bit “off on its own.”
                    Then when you went South and got into southern Serbia and Kosovo, the Albanian
                    area, the poverty level declined very fast, as did the development level.
                    Macedonia was little better than Kosovo, and Montenegro was sort of a
                    “privileged appendage” of Serbia. When Serbia did all right, Montenegro was
                    OKAY.</p>
                <p>Tito was trying to arrange a major, incremental “wealth transfer” from the
                    northern to the southern part of Yugoslavia, for development purposes. This was
                    causing unhappiness among the Croatians and Slovenes, in particular. We saw
                    that. Tito was handling this situation at that time. He was still a vital,
                    vigorous man. Every time there were rumors that Tito was ill, not doing well, or
                    ailing, the next thing you would see was a picture of Tito with a big, fat grin
                    on his face, looking down at a boar he had just shot. It was something like
                    that. It was real theater.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Tito was very much in charge. He had set up collective, rotating Presidencies,
                    both of the country and of the Communist Party. They worked as long as he was
                    around. In fact, it took a number of years for these collective Presidencies to
                    deteriorate and finally break down. following his death in 1980. However, the
                    underlying tensions at the time and the underlying causes for what happened
                    later were economic in nature.</p>
                <p>That situation accelerated when things finally fell apart as a result of an
                    economic downturn in Western Europe. The main source of hard currency for
                    Yugoslavia came from Yugoslav “guest workers” up in Western Europe. Principally
                    Germany, but also in the Low Countries, some in France, and a lot of them in
                    Switzerland and Scandinavia. A sort of “normal” family in Yugoslavia had the
                    father working in a Western European country, making money and driving back to
                    Yugoslavia every six months in a car which he would sell back home and make
                    money on the sale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure of the timing, but at one point Tito
                        apparently felt that things were getting out of control on the nationalistic
                        side, particularly in Croatia. I think that this was when Franjo Tudjman was
                        put in jail. Did this happen around that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I think that this happened after I left Yugoslavia in 1975. That action
                    marked the beginning of deeper problems in Yugoslavia. However, as long as he
                    was alive, Tito kept these problems pretty much “under the surface.” I must say
                    that when I was in Yugoslavia, we were going almost every night during the week
                    to one kind of social function or another. That was how you got information. You
                    could go down to the Writers' Club or the Cultural Workers' Club at 11:00 PM,
                    have dinner, drink slivovitz until 2:00 AM, and pick up information that way.
                    Politicians, members of Parliament, members of the Tito administration, and
                    students and intellectuals were all at one of those places. It was a wonderful
                    time to be a political reporting officer. It was hard on the liver but it was
                    lots of fun.</p>
                <p>For example, you would be sitting at a table with a mixture of Serbs, Croats, and
                    Bosnians. They treated each other with civility. There were always jokes back
                    and forth and that kind of thing. You didn't have a sense of deeply felt
                    animosity and hostility. I guess that hostilities were lurking there, under the
                    surface. However, it took a different political climate for them to come
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At least my impression is that it took “really nasty,”
                        political leadership to bring Yugoslavia down the way it came down.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>TICE: I think that that's a very accurate way of putting it. I think that you had
                    “really nasty” political leadership on the part of two people: Franjo Tudjman
                    [of Croatia] and Slobodan Milosevic [of Serbia]. Q: Absolutely. How did we look
                    at Yugoslavia from 1970 to 1975, both from Belgrade and when you were on the
                    Yugoslav desk? This was a time of slowly rising tensions. The “Cold War” was
                    still on. Where did we see Yugoslavia?</p>
                <p>TICE: We saw Yugoslavia as an asset and not a problem. During the 1950's we were
                    providing Yugoslavs with most of its military supplies, their training, and all
                    of this kind of thing.</p>
                <p>Then, in the 1960's that began to “tail off.” The Soviets began to cultivate the
                    Yugoslavs more intensively and began to provide them with some of their military
                    supplies and develop closer ties with them. I think that Tito felt that things
                    had gone too far in one direction. So there began to be some real questions in
                    the U. S. Government over what Tito really was. That is, whether he was a
                    “stalking horse” for the Soviets or whether he was really trying to stay in the
                    middle. Of course, Tito was one of the leaders of the “Non Aligned Movement”
                    [NAM], which was creating public relations problems for the Yugoslavs in the
                    U.S. as politicians leapt on Yugoslav activities in the NAM to make points.</p>
                <p>During the period I was in Yugoslavia and dealing intensively with that country
                    for more than five years, both in Washington and then in Belgrade, I don't think
                    that anybody in a position to know in detail what was going on there, ever
                    really thought that the Yugoslavs were working for the Soviets. I think that our
                    impression was that the Yugoslavs were honestly trying to “balance” relations
                    between both sides. Sometimes, to reach that “balance,” they would shift the
                    other way for a time, and this would irritate people. However, I don't think
                    that the Yugoslavs were ever seen as anything but a potential ally.</p>
                <p>Among other things, if you looked at the various war games and land scenarios
                    that we played back in those days, we always knew that if the Russians ever set
                    foot in Yugoslavia, Tito had his “arms caches” and his Yugoslav National Army.
                    They would go back into the hills, and the Russians would meet the same fate
                    that the Germans did during World War II. However, they would be facing a better
                    trained and better armed adversary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Vietnam issue? It “played out” during the
                        time that you were in the Balkans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes. It began when I was in Bulgaria and continued while I was in
                    Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Government officially played the “sanctimonious” game
                    of referring to their “great Vietnamese allies,” meaning the Vietnamese
                    communists, and all of that stuff. It irritated the hell out of all of us that
                    way. However, when you got into a private conversation with the Yugoslavs, the
                    issue never came up. If it did, they would say: “We understand your problem and
                    are glad it's yours and not ours.” [Laughter]</p>

                </p>
                <p>TICE: No, we weren't dealing with it as a real issue, except insofar as Yugoslav

                        proclamations issued by the Governor of Pennsylvania and that sort of
                        thing.</hi>

                    Chetnik leader, on the grounds of the U. S. Capitol. Every damned year he
                    introduced a bill authorizing putting up this statue, and all hell broke loose
                    every year because, as you know, both personally as well as politically,
                    Mikhailovic and Tito were rabid adversaries.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TICE: He was a Chicago “ethnic politician.” I guess that I got to know “Big Ed”
                    Derwinski pretty well when I was on the Yugoslav desk in the State Department.
                    He also came out to Yugoslavia several times when I was in Belgrade. Derwinski
                    was a member of the U. S. Delegation to the Inter- Parliamentary Union (IPU,
                    came to with the U.S. IPU Delegation when they were having their world meeting
                    in Belgrade. He had asked us in advance: “Do you think that I'll have a
                    problem?” Ambassador Toon said: “Of course not. Just come out here.” Well, when
                    Derwinski arrived in Belgrade, he was being “hit up” from every side by
                    Yugoslavs, giving him “fits” about his bill to erect a statue to Mikhailovic. He
                    finally came to me and said basically: “Look, would you tell the Yugoslavs to
                    call these guys off? I have to put in that bill every year because that is what
                    I need to do for my constituency. If this bill ever came to the floor of the
                    House of Representatives for a vote, I'd probably have to vote against it. But

                <p>TICE: They were generally pretty good because the Consul General in Zagreb was
                    Orme Wilson. He had been my predecessor as Yugoslav desk officer in the
                    Department of State. He was an “old Yugoslav hand” and belonged to an old

                    knew a lot about Yugoslavia. He'd previously served in Belgrade and Zagreb and
                    then returned to Zagreb as Consul General when he left the Yugoslav desk in
                    Washington. He was there for five years, so he was there during the better part
                    of the time that I was in Belgrade as Political Counselor.</p>
                <p>Previously, when the reporting from Zagreb got a little “out of hand,” the Consul
                    General was someone else. That Consul General and the people assigned to the

                    Political Section of six officers, as I recall, and somebody had to stay in
                    Belgrade and attend the meetings. So I didn't travel as much as I liked. I

                    Ambassador Toon) to the Republic of Kosovo, in southern Yugoslavia. There wasn't
                    any “easy living” in Kosovo. The best hotel there was pretty “seedy.” [Laughter]
                    You were lucky if you got a shower, never mind whether it had hot or cold
                    running water!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see a problem in Kosovo at that time? Were you able
                        to talk to members of the Albanian ethnic group there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>TICE: Yes. The problem there was literally growing rapidly, because the people of
                    Kosovo had the highest birth rate of any area on the European continent. This
                    was a problem that the Serbs were anguishing over. One of the last rulers of
                    Serbia had died fighting the Turks, but “the holy fields of Kosovo,” as this
                    period of Serbia was recalled, were becoming an enclave of Albanians, whom the
                    Serbs considered were an “inferior people.” The prejudice of the Serbs against
                    the Albanians is difficult to believe, even compared to feelings which both you
                    and I have observed expressed, right here in the United States. This Serb
                    feeling expressed the most “vicious” discrimination against a minority group
                    which I have ever seen. The Serbs considered the Albanians “animals.” At that
                    time, of course, the Serb working man was often up in Germany making money in
                    German factories, while a good part of the unskilled work in the Republic of
                    Serbia, certainly in Belgrade, was done by people of Albanian ancestry from
                    Kosovo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Albanians from Kosovo wore distinctive, white skull
                        caps. Any time there was any hauling to be done, it was done by people
                        wearing white skull caps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: That's right. It was a festering problem. Everyone knew that it was a
                    problem and that it wasn't going to go away, though the Serbs were trying to
                    ignore it. Tito was trying to assuage or diminish the problem by encouraging
                    development in Kosovo, but he was meeting with resistance from the Serbs and the
                    northern republics, none of whom wanted to see wealth they were creating go to
                    the Albanians in the Kosovo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time were we “cultivating” the Albanian minority,
                        if that is the right term?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Well, we opened a USIS Information Center in Skopje in Macedonia, the
                    republic adjoining Kosovo, which had a large Albanian minority. While I was in
                    Yugoslavia, there was a marvelous American named George Forner, George had been
                    a Presbyterian minister, then joined the Peace Corps, and then worked for USIA.
                    He was one of those people whom you would call on if you needed some kind of
                    missionary in the wilds of Brazil. He just thrived on going into a place like
                    Kosovo.. When they rebuilt the part of Skopje which had been hardest hit by the
                    1963 earthquake, what they called the “gradski zid,” the “city wall,” which
                    enclosed the old city, had completely fallen down. On the old foundations they
                    built the new “city wall,” consisting of buildings about seven or eight stories
                    high. There were residences on the upper floors, with shops and offices on the
                    lower floors.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>So we put our USIS Information Center in one of the ground floor areas of the new
                    city wall. Well, the building was going along very slowly. Forner, virtually
                    single-handed, “ramroded” getting the construction done, ordering material, and
                    getting workers to keep working instead of going off to drink “slivovitz” [plum
                    brandy, a popular alcoholic drink in Yugoslavia]. While everything else was sort
                    of a “shell,” the USIS Information Center was a “bright spot of light” in this
                    desolate area. Forner was known as “the American” in Macedonia, and he traveled
                    a lot into the “Shiptar” area of Kosovo, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Shiptar” is the Serb word for the Albanians. How were
                        relations, as we saw them, between Greece and Yugoslavia in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: They were “proper” and “correct” and presented no big problems because,
                    while the Greeks have always considered Macedonia to be Greek, there was no
                    attempt to mount “incursions” into Yugoslav Macedonia or that kind of thing. If
                    there were any problems with Greece, they were referred to as “problems with
                    Greece and Bulgaria.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Yugoslav problems with Bulgaria, your old
                        “stamping ground”? TICE: Well, they were sort of like a “fly on the butt.”
                        The Bulgarians would “bite” at Yugoslavia occasionally, and Tito would
                        “swat” at them. That was all. There were never any military actions. A
                        couple of times a year there would be eruptions or exchanges of accusations,
                        and that kind of thing. As far as Tito's Yugoslavia was concerned, Macedonia
                        was an integral part of Yugoslavia. The Bulgarians always said that
                        Macedonia is Bulgarian.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Balkans the Western Embassies are much closer to
                        each other than, say, Western Embassies in London and Paris. You really felt
                        that you were “together.” Was there any particular “differences of view”
                        between, say, the French, the British, the Germans, and the Americans? Or
                        were we all pretty much on the same wavelength during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I think that we were pretty much on the same wavelength. There were NATO
                    [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] groups in Belgrade which met regularly,
                    There was a NATO Ambassadors' group which, I think, met once a month, and a NATO
                    Defense Attach�s group which met once a month. Of course, the Defense Attach�s
                    group was pretty much on the intelligence side.</p>
                <p>The military attach�s, I think, were more subject to Yugoslav harassment than we
                    were. This was because the attach�s were out, looking at various military
                    installations. They traveled to collect intelligence on and in Yugoslavia.
                    Travel by Embassy officers was to get to know people and that kind of thing.
                    This also involved gathering intelligence, but it was of a different kind.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Certainly, I don't recall any major differences among the NATO allies while we
                    were in Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that you had six officers in the Political
                        Section, beside yourself. I'm speaking now as a non-political officer, but
                        Yugoslavia is not that big a country. When I was in Yugoslavia, I often
                        thought that we were reporting on developments at the equivalent of the
                        county level. I wondered if we were getting our money's worth by reporting
                        in that much detail. Now, Yugoslavia is a great country to work in. However,
                        couldn't we have done as good reporting with fewer people? What did you feel
                        about this, at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Looking at the matter in retrospect, I suppose that we could have gotten
                    along with fewer people. One of the Political Officers was a young guy named
                    Chuck Smith. Chuck sort of “went to ground” in the university community. His
                    girl friend was a Yugoslav Serb. They later married and had a family.</p>
                <p>—</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Side A of Tape 3 of the interview with Don

                </p>
                <p>TICE: I used to think that it was fine that Chuck didn't show up at the Embassy,
                    wearing a tie and looking like most Foreign Service Officers, most of the time.
                    That was at a time when there was a low-level dissident group, called the
                    “Belgrade 8,” consisting of eight professors at the university who were having
                    philosophical differences with Tito. This was causing quite a lot of furor among
                    the equivalent of “Kremlinologists” or “Yugoslav watchers” and that kind of
                    thing. If I remember correctly, one of the “Belgrade 8” was the elder brother of
                    Chuck Smith's girl friend. So he had total access to this group. By that time
                    his Serbian was so good that he was virtually “one of the gang.” He did great
                    reporting from that vantage point.</p>
                <p>You had a question. What was that worth? Well, at the time it seemed to be worth
                    quite a lot. In the long sweep of history it probably wasn't worth a “hill of
                    beans.” However, you never know.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Another junior Political Officer was Dick Miles. Dick was Ambassador to
                    Azerbaijan, and then DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission] in Moscow. He left that
                    position and is now Chief of Mission in Belgrade. He is not called Ambassador,
                    because we don't have formal relations with Serbia at the ambassadorial level.
                    When I was political counselor, Dick sat half a level down from me in that
                    crumby old office building we had in Belgrade. His office, in fact, was sort of
                    an overgrown broom closet. He literally read every newspaper and other
                    publication put out in Yugoslavia. He would come up with absolutely amazing
                    information from the provincial press that you would never find sitting in
                    Belgrade or even making trips to these areas. We did, of course, go out and make
                    visits and calls throughout Yugoslavia, and we got good insights into what
                    attitudes were like through this travel. But we were very lucky to have a guy
                    like Dick on the Embassy staff, who garnered a lot of excellent insights simply
                    by reading all the provincial press..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the Political Section, and the Embassy
                        as a whole, served as a “resource” for other, friendly Embassies and for
                        foreign correspondents in Belgrade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Oh, yes. We were very close to the press and were constantly being asked
                    questions by friendly Embassies. A significant part of our job involved
                    providing information to friendly Embassies. This also, of course, gave us a
                    certain leverage. The symbiotic relationship with the resident foreign also was
                    useful in instances when we might want to know something about this or that but
                    didn't want to go and ask the question directly of some government official. We
                    could put a friendly reporter up to asking the question. We were Dusko Dodor was
                    there for the “Washington Post”, as was Strobe Talbott [formerly “Time Magazine”
                    correspondent and now Deputy Secretary of State]. He apparently was based in
                    Belgrade while he was editing “Khrushchev Remembers” [Khrushchev's memoirs], but
                    on sight strategically should Tito die. Another excellent reporter was Roy
                    Gutman, who then worked for Reuters, but subsequently moved to “Newsday”, where
                    he subsequently won a Pulitzer Prize for his early reporting on genocide in
                    Bosnia</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say that you would “use” the foreign journalists
                        or had a “symbiotic relationship” with them, what do you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Well, you might know through intelligence sources that something or other
                    had probably happened. A foreign journalist might come to you and say: “Have you
                    heard anything about this or that?” If you wanted to warn him off the subject
                    you could say: “No, never heard of it.” However, if you wanted a matter to come
                    to public notice or thought the journalist might be able to smoke something out,
                    you could stimulate your journalist colleague to look into it further. This was,
                    of course, a two-way street, because it provided the Journalist had the benefit
                    of being tipped off or guided in the right direction to get a story. This is a
                    classic journalist-diplomat relationship worldwide.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The journalists could ask about such a subject without
                        “ruffling feathers,” which might be the case if an Embassy officer did
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Oh, yes. The journalists sometimes came up with information which we hadn't
                    come across. We could then check out this information through our intelligence
                    sources. Occasionally, the result of the check would be that the information was
                    accurate and might provide some further details regarding a development. Then
                    you could get some guidance on what you could and couldn't say about the
                    subject. That was the other side of this relationship.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget that there were rumors about a Right Wing, communist “cell”
                    down on the Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia, led by a guy that Tito had thrown out
                    of the Communist Party years before. One of the reporters came to me and said:
                    “I've got very good and detailed information on this. I don't want to look like
                    a fool. I don't know whether to report this or not.” I said: “Well, if I were
                    you, I would run it.” He said: “Thank you.” [Laughter] We wanted this story to
                    get out. Once it was out in public, we could collect more information on it. So
                    that was a useful relationship.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the “Watergate Affair.” What impact

                </p>
                <p>TICE: The Yugoslavs weren't terribly interested. They regarded President Richard
                    Nixon and Secretary of State Kissinger as “friends” and supporters of theirs.
                    This was because Nixon was the first President to invite Marshal Tito to enter
                    the front door of the White House. He had made a previous visit to the White
                    House but was “smuggled in” by dark of night during the administration of
                    President Kennedy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in 1963.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes. However, this was the first time that Tito came into the White House
                    in his full regalia. I was on the Yugoslav desk then and was involved in all of
                    that.</p>
                <p>When the Watergate affair began to unravel, I think that the Yugoslavs basically
                    didn't understand it. I happened to be having a reception at my house the day
                    that President Nixon resigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been in the summer of 1974.</hi>

                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>TICE: Right. I had an old, black and white, Sears television set, which I had
                    rewired to receive the local Belgrade stations. When something big was happening
                    in world news, the local Belgrade stations would pick up international coverage,
                    and the stations were carrying the resignation story direct from Washington. So,
                    I set the TV on a central pedestal in the entry hall of my residence and I
                    turned it on so this reception featured coverage of the story that the President
                    of the United States had resigned.</p>
                <p>A number of Yugoslavs came up to me and said: “You Americans are the strangest
                    people! Why would you show this to us?” My answer was simple: “Because that's
                    what democracy is all about. That's how we change our leadership. You people
                    should know that.” However, in the larger sense, the Yugoslav public wasn't
                    terribly interested in the Watergate Affair. They didn't consider it a “big
                    deal.” They felt that our leaders changed all the time, so what was the “big
                    fuss”?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1975 you left Yugoslavia. Where did you go
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: In 1975 I came back to the United States to attend the National War
                    College.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This must have been a rather traumatic time, because of
                        the collapse of the Republic of Vietnam. Can you give us a feel for the
                        attitude of our military leaders and where they felt they were going at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I can give you something of a feel for that. You're quite right. Most of my
                    classmates at the National War College were lieutenant colonels, colonels, and
                    their Navy equivalents, commanders and captains. They were almost all products
                    of the Vietnam era. They had served one, two, and three tours of duty in
                    Vietnam. Many of them were combat veterans. They had done well, which is why
                    they were sent to the most senior of the war colleges. Some of them had a very
                    broad perspective. Some of them had obtained advanced degrees and had done
                    things like assignments in the State Department working on political-military
                    affairs. However, I would say that the majority of my classmates tended to be
                    pretty narrowly focused military officers. It was as if they were coming up out
                    of the water to take a deep breath, and here they were in the National War
                    College.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>I'll never forget one guy, a Navy Commander, who, during about the second week of
                    the course, was visibly frustrated when we left a meeting. He was snarling. I
                    said: “John, what's wrong?” He said: “Why am I listening to this stuff? What
                    does this have to do with people? I'm trained to kill efficiently. Why do I need
                    to know this stuff?” So we went off and talked about that for a while. It was
                    interesting to watch John and several others of my classmates, who had been
                    pretty narrowly focused on the technical aspects of how best to defeat the
                    enemy, sort of “blossom” as they began to see what they had been doing in the
                    context of the larger world situation.</p>
                <p>We were the Class of 1976 at the National War College. We had a goodly number of
                    “war heroes” in that class, including then Colonel Colin Powell [later Chairman
                    of the Joint Chiefs of Staff], of course. I saw my Navy classmate, Commander
                    John, at our tenth anniversary party in 1986. He was still on active duty and,
                    by now, was wearing three stars on his shoulders [Vice Admiral]. I walked up to
                    him, grinned, and said: “Vice Admiral, eh?” We laughed. He said: “I know what
                    you're thinking, Don.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>It was a very interesting class. When the course started, I didn't know whether I
                    would enjoy it very much, but I certainly did. Prior to this assignment, my
                    experience with the military had been very limited. I only served in the
                    military for two years, but that involved writing textbooks at Lackland Air
                    Force Base, so I didn't have much experience. I found that my classmates were
                    every bit the intellectual equivalents of my Foreign Service colleagues. They
                    had just had a different life experience and training. There were some really
                    fine people in that class. Every five years we have an anniversary “get
                    together.” We had one this year [1997]. Most of the class showed up, those of us
                    who are still alive.</p>
                <p>I came away from this experience very impressed with our military colleagues, and
                    I looked at military officers very differently after that. For me it was a very
                    different exposure to people who had led a different kind of life and who had
                    had a different professional life experience than I had had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling of your classmates about the state of
                        our military forces during this period, 1975-1976? South Vietnam had fallen
                        to the communists in 1975. Although our forces were out of there at the
                        time, I don't know what the feeling was among our military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: A lot of the focus of what we did during that year was away from Southeast
                    Asia. These guys had had their bellies full of Southeast Asia. In fact, each
                    National War College class at that time, and I suppose they still do, what was
                    called a “class trip.” That meant that groups of would go to one or another of
                    the regions of the world. You could take a trip to Europe, Russia, East Asia,
                    Latin America, or Africa, plus a domestic trip. Only five of us took the East
                    Asia trip. Everybody else had enough of Southeast Asia, and preferred to go
                    elsewhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>The focus of our studies at the National War College was on the Soviet Union,
                    which, of course, was then very much alive. In some ways, perhaps, it was at the
                    zenith of its power. The question was what was going to happen there, how would
                    we guard against that, and all of that kind of thing. The feeling seemed to be
                    that the “diversion” of Vietnam was now behind us. It was now time to look at
                    the larger conflict with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then where did you go in 1976?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: In 1976 I went to work for Chuck Robinson, who was Deputy Secretary of
                    State - Henry Kissinger's deputy, as it were. This was the last year of the
                    administration of President Ford.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you worked there from 1976 until...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Until January, 1977. I was the senior political adviser for Chuck Robinson.
                    A guy named Rud Poats was his senior economic adviser. Previously, Chuck
                    Robinson had been Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, before he
                    became Deputy Secretary of the Department of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Robinson's basic background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: He was a businessman, a marine engineer. He had designed and built cargo
                    containers and extraction equipment for taking ores of various kinds out of
                    countries around the “Pacific Rim,” from Chile all the way around to the “black
                    sands” of New Zealand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like an “odd” appointment for someone to work in
                        conjunction with Henry Kissinger, who was a sort of political creature “par
                        excellence.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Well, Henry Kissinger had neither an interest nor, I would say, a deep
                    background on the economic side of things, and he wanted somebody to run this
                    for him. Then he also wanted someone who would handle the “ceremonial aspect” of
                    being Secretary of State and not squawk about it. So Chuck Robinson had to see
                    every foreign Ambassador who wanted to come into the State Department and make a
                    “demarche” about something. Secretary Kissinger would almost never see foreign
                    Ambassadors, unless the Ambassadors were from Israel, the Soviet Union, the
                    United Kingdom, France, and countries like that. Nobody else got in to see
                    Kissinger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Chuck Robinson, in a way, was the “flak catcher”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>TICE: He was the “flak catcher.” He was also a very interesting guy. He had made
                    I don't know how many millions of dollars. He was a very wealthy man. They were
                    an odd couple, but the generally go on well. However, Kissinger on one occasion
                    had asked him to take charge of a particular issue, and then without telling
                    Robinson took an action and “under cut” him. Now, this wasn't unusual for
                    Kissinger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did Robinson and you, as his political adviser,
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Well, what I spent most of my time doing was following arms control and
                    nuclear proliferation issues. This was the point when the French and the
                    Germans, respectively, were trying to export sensitive, nuclear weapons
                    materials and “know how” to Pakistan and Brazil. We were trying to work, behind
                    the scenes, without irritating either the Pakistani or Brazilian Governments,
                    or, for that matter, the French and German Governments, to put a stop to that
                    effort. We were trying to get interim agreements on that subject.</p>
                <p>Winston Lord was then the head of Kissinger's Policy Planning Staff. Reginald
                    Bartholomew was in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. Chuck Robinson was
                    charged with taking action on that matter, and I was his “action officer.” So
                    basically I worked with Lord and Bartholomew and their staffs on persuading the
                    French and the Germans not to transfer nuclear technology to Pakistan and
                    Brazil. I was the day-by-day action guy keeping Robinson involved and informed.
                    It was an interesting area which I hadn't been into before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the French and German attitudes on this issue?
                        What were we up against? Was this a strictly commercial matter or something
                        more?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I think that it was probably a little of both. I think that this was a case
                    of “outreach” on the part of the French in particular. They like to have
                    influence in other countries, as we know. I think that was one of the main
                    points. However, there was also money in it for the French, as they saw it. The
                    question of making money was probably the principal consideration for the
                    French. The Germans have an historical interest in Latin America, and I am sure
                    their objective was to tighten relations with the American hemisphere colossus
                    of the south</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>TICE: Well, I think that nothing much happened at the time. The result of our
                    efforts was to slow down what the French and Germans wanted to do. In the case
                    of Brazil, I think that the Brazilians, earlier on than the Pakistanis, finally
                    decided that it wasn't in their interest to become a “nuclear nation.” The issue
                    sort of “withered away” in the case of Brazil. Nuclear development in Pakistan
                    obviously is still an issue. As you will recall, the French were successful in
                    transferring enough nuclear technology to Iraq so that the Israelis ultimately
                    went in and blew up the Iraqi nuclear facilities. I think that it is now
                    conceded that the Pakistanis have the potential capability of exploding a
                    nuclear weapon, though it may not be clear whether they do have this ability. I
                    suppose that the efforts we made slowed down the process of the transfer of
                    nuclear technology to Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the use of the Policy Planning
                        Staff and Winston Lord's management of it during the latter part of
                        Kissinger's service as Secretary of State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: This was probably the period when the Policy Planning Staff had its
                    greatest influence since the days of George Kennan [original director of Policy
                    Planning]. I wasn't in the Department during the Kennan days, but this
                    conclusion is based on what I read of it. Lord was very close to Kissinger. He
                    was in and out of Kissinger's office all the time. So the Policy Planning Staff
                    had a real impact. U. S. foreign policy was very much “run” by Kissinger when he
                    was Secretary of State. The NSC [National Security Council] had nowhere near the
                    power he had. When Kissinger moved over from being Director of the National
                    Security Council staff to being Secretary of State, he brought that power with
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other issues that you were involved in,
                        particularly with Chuck Robinson, during this year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Not really. However, one event that I was able to “sit in” on illustrates
                    something that is not well known. That is, much as Henry Kissinger tended to
                    belittled U. S. diplomats and the Foreign Service in his public statements, in
                    fact, I think that he used the Foreign Service to greater advantage in terms of
                    U. S. foreign policy than any other Secretary of State that I am aware of.</p>
                <p>After the 1976 presidential elections were held, and President Ford had been
                    defeated, Secretary Kissinger was a “lame duck.” He held a meeting with all of
                    the Assistant Secretaries in the Department of State. However, as Chuck Robinson
                    used to say: “There are the Assistant Secretaries, and then there are the 'real'
                    Assistant Secretaries.” That is, the people who didn't just have the title of
                    Assistant Secretary because they were appointed for political reasons, but
                    rather because they really “ran” something. He was referring to all of the “real
                    policy types.”</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>Anyway, Kissinger met with all of the “real policy types.” The meeting was held
                    in Chuck Robinson's conference room, a little chamber behind his office.
                    Kissinger came in and said: “I want you to look around. You will notice that
                    there aren't any political appointees here. You are all 'career people.' You are
                    the people who run the Foreign Service and the State Department. You all are
                    going to lose your jobs. That's a foregone conclusion. However, you're going to
                    have to run American foreign policy until they actually bring in successors for
                    you. That may take a long time.” Then Kissinger gave them a very straightforward
                    “pep talk” on doing what was in the interests of the nation, not trying to “put
                    down” the new leaders but trying to work with them, and trying to make the
                    “transition” function as well as possible. To paraphrase, as closely as I can
                    recall, he said: “Basically, this is in your hands. The incoming administration
                    is going to have people who will be learning their jobs. Until they complete
                    this process, it's up to you, meanwhile, to run American foreign policy. It's no
                    accident that you are all career people.” This was a very interesting series of
                    comments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to you? You lost your job, obviously...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Well, when the election of 1976 was over, when Jimmy Carter was elected
                    President, we were all looking around for something to do. At that time Phil
                    Habib was the Under Secretary for Political Affairs. Phil had been appointed to
                    this position at the same time that Chuck Robinson was appointed Deputy
                    Secretary of State. Phil Habib knew Robinson from the time when Phil was
                    Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, from which position he
                    was appointed Under Secretary for Political Affairs.</p>
                <p>Dan O'Donohue was Executive Assistant to Phil Habib. Dan said that Phil had
                    watched me work with Chuck Robinson, liked what he saw, and knew that I was a
                    specialist on communist affairs. O'Donohue said that one of the first people who
                    would be “booted out the door” of the State Department at the end of the Ford
                    administration was the person who really ran Soviet policy for Kissinger. That
                    was Hal Sonnenfeldt [who had the position of Counselor of the Department]. Phil
                    had told O'Donohue that he needed to have someone who was knowledgeable about
                    Soviet affairs and that Phil needed to reestablish his contacts with Eastern
                    Europe. Art Hartman was the Assistant Secretary for European Affairs at that
                    time. Art was a very experienced officer but, at that time, he didn't have a
                    deep background in Soviet affairs.</p>
                <p>So on January 20. 1977, I moved 50 yards down the hall and set up shop in Phil
                    Habib's office to be his adviser on arms control, the Soviet Union, and Eastern
                    Europe. Phil had an East Asian specialist, an African specialist, and a Middle
                    East specialist on his staff, but he didn't have a specialist on Eastern Europe
                    and Latin America. Phil asked me if I knew anything about Latin America. I said:
                    “Not really.” Phil said: “Well, I know something about that, so why don't you be
                    my specialist on Latin America, too?” So I picked up the portfolios on Latin
                    America and Eastern Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Then, when Dan O'Donohue left Habib's office some six months later [summer of
                    1977], I moved up to be Phil's Executive Assistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you served under Phil Habib as Under Secretary for
                        Political Affairs from 1977 until...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: From 1977 until Phil Habib left that job early in 1979. Phil had a heart
                    attack, I think, in 1978. I was in Phil's office for a little less than two
                    years. It was a fascinating job because, when the Carter administration came
                    into office, there were a lot of former junior Foreign Service Officers who had
                    gone out to make their way in the big political world and came back to the
                    Department as Assistant Secretaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They included Dick Holbrooke, Dick Moose, Tony Lake, and
                        Pat Derian, in the human rights field, as well as others. These were
                        essentially people who had resigned from the Department over the issue of
                        Vietnam policy. So these were the “outs” coming back “in.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Right. And there were a lot of other diversions and attractions at the
                    Assistant Secretary level. I won't start naming names, because many of these
                    people are still around. Pat Derian, Assistant Secretary for Human Rights, was a
                    real force in the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm interviewing her now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Good. She'll have a very interesting perspective on events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She really does. How she got into the State Department is
                        very interesting. At least according to her version, she was picked to be
                        “Miss Human Rights” and to go and “kick some butts” around there. She says
                        that the job grew with time. She was offered Protocol or Human Rights. She
                        sort of defined her own job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: She was a “power” in the Department. So this was a very interesting
                    time.</p>
                <p>However, as I observed from seeing administrations come into office, and I seemed
                    to be in Washington during those periods, Republican administrations bring in
                    “managers.” They want to make things “run right.” Democratic administrations
                    tend to bring in people who are policy-oriented and have “objectives.” This is
                    the same in both domestic and foreign policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>In foreign policy many of these new Assistant Secretaries had their own personal
                    agendas and objectives. They started running off to do it. Phil Habib was the
                    senior foreign policy official in office at the time that Secretary of State
                    Cyrus Vance came into office. Vance had a lot of “getting up to speed” to do.
                    Vance's Deputy Secretary, Warren Christopher, did not get appointed and
                    confirmed for some weeks, and he had not previously been in a foreign policy
                    position like this at all. So there was a real “learning curve” to be followed
                    and a time lag involved. To all intents and purposes, Phil Habib was Secretary
                    of State, at least for the first couple of months of the Carter
                    administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe how Phil Habib operated during this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: What Phil Habib wanted to know was who was holding meetings and who was
                    going to attend. He wanted to know of, and be able to influence decisions. There
                    were seven of us on his staff. One of our duties was to get that information.
                    Then, at Phil's 7:00 AM meeting, before he went to the Secretary of State's
                    staff meeting, he wanted to know what meetings were being held in the Department
                    at the Assistant Secretary level and in the NSC [National Security Council]. He
                    would either pick up the phone and call an Assistant Secretary and say: “Look,
                    you're having this meeting on thus and so, and I think you had better have so
                    and so there. I've called them and asked them to attend.” Then he'd have us take
                    care of making the arrangements. His frequent remark on who was going to be at
                    this meeting was: “Oh, there isn't anybody there who could find that country on
                    the map!”</p>
                <p>Phil also had a direct line to the Secretary of State. He would pick up the phone
                    and say: “Cy, so and so is having this meeting on such and such. There isn't
                    anybody scheduled to be there who really understands this issue. I think that
                    you should have so and so and so and so there.” It was a subtle approach to the
                    problem, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was not just pushing a particular policy. It was aimed
                        at making sure that the people at these meetings didn't get “off the
                        reservation” [i.e., changed established policy without full consideration of
                        the consequences]. There were many new people at these meetings, they were
                        very eager, and they could go charging off in all directions. So it was up
                        to the Under Secretary for Political Affairs to make sure that there was
                        some coherence in our policies.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>TICE: And some of these issues, such as on foreign assistance policy, involved
                    Tony Lake, who was the Director of Policy Planning. He was the “point man” on
                    foreign assistance. Phil Habib had very basic disagreements with Tony Lake on
                    this issue. Tony was a firm proponent of the idea that foreign aid should only
                    go to those countries defined under the United Nations rules as the “most
                    needy.” Phil's view was that we have to give some aid above that level because,
                    if you don't, they may go “down the drain.” His case in point was the Caribbean,
                    where the British had just pulled out their budget support for all of the newly
                    independent governments of the Leeward and Windward Islands, Jamaica, and all
                    the way around to Belize [in Central America]. Phil wanted to continue our aid
                    and budget assistance programs there during the transition to independence. Tony
                    Lake didn't want to do this. I remember Phil saying: “Tony, if we leave them to
                    their own devices, in a few years you're going to be having communist or leftist
                    governments there. They'll be below the poverty level, all right, under your
                    formula, but it will cost us a lot more.” Tony won on that issue, and it wound
                    up costing us a lot more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your perspective, how did Secretary of State Cyrus
                        Vance use the Policy Planning Staff? Was it any different from the way
                        Secretary Kissinger used it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Very frankly, I think that Tony Lake was acting more like a functional
                    Assistant Secretary of State in certain areas. In effect, he “ran” policy in
                    those areas, rather than providing advice to the Secretary and the regional
                    Assistant Secretary of State concerned. I say that, although I have never sat in
                    on any of Tony Lake's meetings or anything like that. I don't want to be unkind
                    or unfair to him. The Policy Planning Staff has played different roles in
                    different Administrations, sometimes looking at broad policy issues and
                    sometimes directly focusing on specific issues. I don't think that Tony himself
                    had the “standing” which Win Lord had when he was Director of Policy Planning
                    under Secretary Kissinger, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On disarmament matters and Eastern Europe, for example,
                        wasn't there an ill-fated trip by Secretary Cyrus Vance to Moscow? He was
                        allegedly going to try to persuade the Soviets to accede to some form of
                        disarmament or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I was not involved in that matter, so I don't know anything about it. Also,
                    that happened after Phil Habib left his position as Under Secretary for
                    Political Affairs. Then we had the “Desert One” debacle [abortive attempt at
                    rescuing the American hostages in Tehran]. But that was also after I left that
                    office.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>One other thing that was clear, however, was that Zbigniew Brzezinski [then
                    National Security Adviser to President Carter] was very influential and tended
                    to “go around” the Secretary of State. This is one of the classic “clashes”
                    within an administration. If you have to speak of “winners” and “losers,” I
                    think that you would have to say that Brzezinski “won.” He was in favor of the
                    attempted rescue of the Embassy Tehran hostages. The failure of this attempt
                    resulted in Cyrus Vance's resignation as Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about an attempted rescue of American
                        Embassy personnel in Tehran after the seizure of our Embassy in November,
                        1979. So we're talking about events in 1980 when you were no longer in that
                        office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Right. Phil had his heart attack, I think that was either December 1977 or
                    January 1978, and he stayed on until it became clear his health would not allow
                    him to work under such pressure, at which time he was replaced by David Newsom,
                    in April 1978. I stayed on another year with Newsom as his Exec, until June of
                    1979. However, I continued to stay in close touch for some time with the staff I
                    had worked with, which included some real stars, among them George Moose,
                    Phyllis Oakley, Dick Jackson, and Tom Miller</p>
                <p>There was quite a lot of “bad feeling” between the Department of State and the
                    NSC during that period. Brzezinski declined to include Department
                    representatives in meetings at the NSC of which, in earlier times, they would
                    have been an integral part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how Cyrus Vance dealt with
                        issues when he was Secretary of State, from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: He was very gentlemanly and very quiet. He ran a fairly “tight” meeting and
                    wanted to hear from all concerned. I didn't attend a lot of his staff meetings.
                    I always found him to be the ultimate in courtesy, acting like a gentleman with
                    me and with other people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Phil Habib involved at all in events in Lebanon during
                        this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: As Under Secretary for Political Affairs he was involved to the degree that
                    any Under Secretary would be in such matters. However, the Assistant Secretary
                    for Near Eastern Affairs at that time was Roy Atherton. Then Atherton went out
                    as Ambassador to Egypt, and the officer who had been Director of INR [Bureau of
                    Intelligence Research], Hal Saunders, became Assistant Secretary for NEA. Phil
                    was kept informed of developments, but they were both strong personalities, and
                    Phil was not nearly as deeply into Lebanese affairs as he was to be later
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Regarding your hand in Latin American affairs, did you
                        keep that for very long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, I kept it for as long as I was in that job. Terry Todman came in as
                    Assistant Secretary for American Republics Affairs [ARA] at the beginning of the
                    Carter Administration. He was distracted a lot, however, because of the White
                    House interest in, and involvement in policies toward Latin America. Todman
                    traveled a lot to Latin America with Mrs. Rosalynn Carter [President Carter's
                    wife]. He was gone from his office a good part of the time, and didn't seem to
                    get around to appointing his Deputy Assistant Secretaries. So Bill Luers, who
                    was appointed in the Ford administration as a Deputy Assistant Secretary, wound
                    up as the principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for more than seven months. Bill
                    is a good officer, but he was not seen as a member of Todman's team, and rather
                    than building that team Todman was off traveling and was not getting
                    replacements for the other Deputy Assistant Secretaries. The Deputy Assistant
                    Secretaries left over from the Ford administration were sort of “lame ducks.” My
                    principal contact in ARA was a Special Assistant to Terry Todman, Charley
                    Jacobini.</p>
                <p>One day, about two months into the Carter administration, I went in to see Phil
                    Habib and said: “Phil, do you know who's running Latin American policy?” Phil
                    said: “Who?” I said: “Me and Charley Jacobini.” Phil said: “But you don't know a
                    damned thing about it!” I said: “That's why I'm telling you!” So Phil put
                    pressure on Terry Todman to arrange for the appointment of his Deputy Assistant
                    Secretaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the problems that were
                        beginning to develop over the overthrow of Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua? Or
                        did that happen “on your watch”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: No, that pretty much happened afterwards. There were some developments
                    going on, but this was pretty early in this connection. I wasn't involved in and
                    had no knowledge of most of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With further reference to Latin American affairs, the
                        Nixon administration was credited, probably given too much credit, with the
                        overthrow of Salvador Allende in Chile and all of that. Did you feel that
                        there was an effort on the part of the Carter administration to show that it
                        really wasn't like those “Nixon types” who were ready to overthrow any “Left
                        Wing” government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I think that in Latin America Carter administration policy was primarily
                    expressed in the human rights area. Pat Derian was very much involved in that,
                    and she was very effective in that respect.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Try to capture the mood of the times. What were the
                        attitudes of both Phil Habib and David Newsom toward Pat Derian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: That's hard to characterize. They understood what her “agenda” was. At
                    times they would be concerned about how this “agenda” would affect policy. On
                    the other hand, neither one of them ever sought “to put Pat down.” Not in the
                    least. They would bring her into various issues, when others might have tried to
                    keep her out. They both understood that human rights were an important issue. At
                    times they had to sit down fairly heavily on other Department officers who
                    didn't agree with Pat Derian and who felt that she was primarily a “destructive”
                    element.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, of course, was a classic conflict between Pat
                        Derian, trying to “push through” her human rights agenda, and the geographic
                        bureaus which said: “Of course, human rights are important, but...” And
                        there's always a reason why there's a “but.” For example, we might have a
                        treaty with a given country, a “tricky” relationship with that country, or
                        something like that. However, at the top of the Department of State there
                        was essentially support for human rights.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself in the position of going down to the
                        next rung below the Secretary of State and saying: “Don't try to undercut
                        this policy of concern for human rights.” Did you get involved in doing
                        something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: In a very limited way. When you are in one of these Special Assistant
                    positions, you have to be careful about getting between an Assistant Secretary
                    of State and an Under Secretary of State. But informally you could do things
                    such as saying to an Assistant Secretary: “You know, you should be aware that
                    Pat Derian will probably 'win' on this issue.” You could start from this point
                    of view.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Side B of Tape 3 of the interview with Don Tice.
                        Was there any progress made in U. S. relations with the Soviet Union during
                        this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Relations between the two countries were pretty much on an “even keel.”
                    This was a period when we reached agreement on SALT II [the second Strategic
                    Arms Limitation Treaty].</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>As a sideline, while I was working for Phil Habib and David Newsom, I became
                    involved as a “SALT seller.” I was one of a group of people in the government
                    who were trained and then went out on the “rubber chicken” circuit [gave talks
                    on the subject to a variety of community groups in various parts of the U. S.].
                    I also appeared on morning TV “talk shows” in Keokuk, Iowa, for example. I did
                    that because I was interested in it. I also did the same kind of thing on Panama
                    Canal treaty issues. I told the people in Public Affairs who were planning these
                    appearances that I would give them two days a month to go out and give
                    speeches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was what we might call a “full court press”
                        effort.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, it was a major effort. I enjoyed doing it because I went all over the
                    United States, visiting places that I had never visited before and have never
                    visited since. I spoke to Kiwanis and other, civic clubs, university groups, and
                    all that kind of stuff. That was “fun,” as far as I was concerned. However, this
                    was a “full court press” on ratification of the SALT II treaty. Of course, the
                    Senate did not agree to ratification of this treaty. This was part of the
                    background which later got me into arms negotiations.</p>
                <p>When I finished my tour in the office of the Under Secretary for Political
                    Affairs, I was fairly exhausted. I had spent more than two years in that job.
                    The job had involved long hours in the office, and I wanted something else. I
                    was offered one of the top jobs in Personnel but decided that I wanted something
                    that was a little less “taxing” for a while. I went off to be a Foreign Service
                    Inspector for two and a half years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TICE: No, I was not.</p>

                <p>TICE: Yes, that's about right. I was a Foreign Service Inspector from
                    1979-1981.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 4, 1997. Don, could you talk about the role
                        of the Foreign Service Inspectors during the period from 1979 to 1981? This
                        was a period of change in the role of the inspectors, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I guess so, yes. We were moving away from the “old time inspection,” which
                    was almost totally policy oriented. The Department began to bring in people who
                    had “auditing training” from the GAO [General Accounting Office] and from other
                    parts of the government, but primarily from the GAO. These people “knew the
                    books,” knew the technical side of management, and that kind of thing. So there
                    was some “tension” about this. However, I think that that is a trend which has
                    continued since my time as an inspector.</p>
                <p>There was still the traditional function of doing a basic, management audit of an
                    Embassy or Consulate or a Bureau in the State Department, for that matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Inspector General when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Bob Brewster was the Inspector General for most of the time. He was
                    replaced by Bob (Robert L.) Brown, a former Administrative Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role did you play as a Foreign Service
                        Inspector?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I dealt with the political aspect of the inspections. On all of the
                    inspection teams that I went out on, I was the deputy chief of the team. I
                    generally inspected the Political Section and relationships with other U. S.
                    Government agencies, particularly in large Embassies, where there are numerous
                    agencies represented. I reviewed relationships with the DAO [Defense Attach�
                    Office] in particular. Sometimes I got into an inspection of the relationship
                    with the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] unit. However, that generally was
                    handled personally by the Ambassador who headed the inspection team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give us an idea of some of the inspections which
                        you participated in, perhaps by geographic areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes. I was probably very fortunate in terms of “creature comforts” in
                    connection with the inspections I participated in, because I inspected our posts
                    in the United Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland, the Soviet Union, Japan, and Panama,
                    plus brief review of the narcotics function in Colombia and the Passport Office
                    in the Department of State,</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's pick out a couple of those which you have named.
                        What was your impression of the situation affecting our Embassy in the
                        Soviet Union while you were there? It had some problems, didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes. Mac Toon was the Ambassador. The Embassy was constantly under a lot of
                    pressure. They had had one very bad fire which had disrupted the place. The new
                    Chancery and associated housing complex was in the beginning phase of
                    construction. They had completed the excavation and were beginning to pour
                    concrete. That construction job had brought in a large number of administrative
                    and management people, overloading the Embassy's ability to maintain its focus
                    and equilibrium. It had more people than the facilities community could easily
                    support.</p>
                <p>The Embassy was tightly run. Mac Toon was a good but tough Ambassador. He pushed
                    his staff continuously. I knew him very well because I was his Political
                    Counselor in Belgrade. On the whole, the Embassy in Moscow was a pretty “up
                    tight” place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Soviets doing? Were the pressures on the
                        Embassy coming mainly from the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, the pressures on the Embassy came from the Soviets. This was not an
                    “easy” period in the Cold War. The nuclear threat continued to grow. The Soviets
                    maintained very close “control” over the Embassy. For example, one of our
                    Foreign Service Inspectors was working on the ground floor of the Embassy office
                    building. There were Soviet guards stationed just outside the gate of the
                    property.</p>
                <p>One day this inspector was inspecting the B&amp;F [Budget and Fiscal] office when
                    he heard a woman screaming. He dashed out into one of the underpasses which led
                    from the street under the Embassy office building and internal courtyard. He
                    found a couple of the big “Militia Guards” [Soviet police], beating the heck out
                    of a middle-aged woman. She was screaming, as I said. My inspector went charging
                    in to do something about this. Someone grabbed him by the coattails and hauled
                    him back, just as he was about to throw a “haymaker” at one of the militiamen
                    administering the beating to the woman. But that kind of thing happened all the
                    time. It's a good thing that somebody caught Tom by the coattails because
                    otherwise we would probably have had to “fish him out of jail.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point had the cases of Sergeant Lonetree and all
                        of that happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: No. Those cases came up after that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the narcotics situation? You were on the team
                        inspecting the narcotics situation as it affected the Embassy in
                        Colombia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: This special inspection took place early on in the escalation of our
                    anti-narcotics in Colombia. The narcotics “cartels” had not really taken over
                    the country at that point. We were under close protection and had armed guards
                    wherever we went. It wasn't as it was later on, when I was there during another
                    period. The situation was a little tense, but we felt free in the evening, when
                    we weren't in an official car. We could walk around because there were plenty of
                    “Norteamericanos” down in Colombia.</p>
                <p>The anti-narcotics program was encountering some problems already. There had been
                    some complaints about the DEA [Drug Enforcement Agency] unit in the Embassy not
                    cooperating fully with the Ambassador. There were also complaints from some of
                    the Embassy officers who felt that they should be kept informed about what the
                    DEA unit was doing. We did a “work out” of the DEA unit itself and then of the
                    narcotics liaison unit in the Embassy.</p>
                <p>I remember that the inspector traveling with me was not long on “mincing words.”
                    When we met with the Ambassador during the first week we were there, the
                    Ambassador was very proud of the cooperation which he had worked out with the
                    Colombian Government and all of that. What we found was that US military
                    equipment was coming in under the military cooperation program and going to
                    airfields on the Caribbean coast of Colombia, where they didn't allow our DEA
                    people to go. The Colombian military was generally helping with the anti-drug
                    program, but we wanted to make sure that this equipment was going into the
                    narcotics interdiction effort. The problem was that this equipment would never
                    be seen again after it arrived in Colombia. We had fairly strong suspicions that
                    it was going to the “wrong side.” The problem was that there was no verification
                    of what was happening with a large amount of equipment.</p>
                <p>When my colleague Tom and I went in to see the Ambassador, and he rather
                    expansively asked us what we thought of how the anti-narcotics effort was going,
                    Tom said: “Well, Mr. Ambassador, it's going along, but unless some controls are
                    put in, you and some other people are probably going to go to jail!” [Laughter]
                    This got the Ambassador's attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in the Inspection Corps when the new Foreign
                        Service Act [of 1980] came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: No, I was not. That came after my time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That changed some aspects of the situation. How did you
                        feel about the effectiveness of the Inspection Corps when you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>TICE: Well, I felt that it was quite good, in general. It depended pretty much on
                    the quality of the Foreign Service Inspectors themselves. We had “team leaders”
                    who were good and we had some who were only “So-so.” However, I think that, in
                    general, the inspections were quite effective. The approach that I always took
                    was that a successful inspection was one where you would identify problems and
                    then identify solutions with the people who had the problems. The inspection
                    report referred to problems that were on the way to solution, rather than mere
                    cases of “gotcha. We went in with the intent of trying to “fix” what you see
                    that can be fixed or helped. I would say that most of the real complaints or
                    findings that we made that involved serious problems resulted from Department
                    itself not holding up its end of the situation in supporting the post. That was
                    a thread that ran through every inspection that I was involved in.</p>

                <p>TICE: I had already been nearly two and a half years in the Inspection business
                    when Personnel called me in and asked if I would consider a detail to ACDA to be
                    Executive Secretary to the newly forming Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START)
                    delegation, headed by retired Army Lt. Gen. Edward Rowny. It should be
                    remembered that Gen. Rowny had been the representative of the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff [JCS] on the U.S. Delegation for the SALT II negotiations. After that
                    treaty was concluded and signed by President Carter in Vienna, Gen. Rowny
                    resigned from the U.S. Delegation to the SALT II negotiations, retired from the
                    U.S. Army, and came out publicly against the SALT II Treaty. He said that this
                    agreement was not verifiable, allowed too much “throw weight” on large missiles,
                    and a whole raft of other things. He joined the conservative wing of the arms
                    control community as one of the chief opponents of the SALT II Treaty.</p>
                <p>Then, when President Reagan was elected [in November, 1980], Gen. Rowny was
                    brought in to handle the job of further arms reduction negotiations with the
                    Soviet Union. It was a rather messy situation, because Gen. Rowny believed that
                    he had been offered the job of ACDA Director by President-elect Ronald Reagan.
                    However, that post went to Eugene Rostow, and General Rowny then was to be the
                    chief negotiator with the Soviets on disarmament issues. However, it was agreed
                    with the Soviets that the arms negotiations would be divided into two parts —
                    strategic and intermediate — and the Rostow, with White House backing, brought
                    in Paul Nitze to handled the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF)
                    negotiations. The end result was that Rowny got only the Strategic portion of
                    the negotiations, which did not leave him a very happy camper. I mention all of
                    this because the tensions within ACDA, and most especially between Rowny and
                    Nitze, had an effect on the politics of both negotiations.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, I was asked by the State Department to go to work for
                    Gen. Rowny. I said that I thought that this would be an interesting job, but
                    that they should be aware that when I was working for Phil I was one of the
                    “SALT Sellers,” one of the people who went out on the “rubber chicken” circuit
                    and got on early morning talk shows with local comedians and cows, trying to
                    convince the public that SALT II I mentioned this previously. I said that I
                    didn't know whether Gen. Rowny would want to touch me with a “10-foot pole”
                    because he was on the other side of the argument over SALT II. They told me: “Go
                    try.” So I went to see Gen. Rowny. I introduced myself and said: “There is
                    something that you should know about me,” and I explained what I had done with
                    regard to SALT II. He said: “Well, do you have any problem being 'tough' on the
                    Soviets?” I said: “No, because I served for six years in communist countries,
                    particularly Bulgaria, which was pretty tightly controlled by the Soviets. The
                    Bulgarians abused me in one way or another, including drugging me once and
                    beating me up once.” I said that I didn't think that I would have any trouble in
                    being hard on the Soviets. He said: “You'll do for this assignment.”
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Reagan administration came into office on January
                        20, 1981. You had this START negotiation. What was the genesis of the name,
                        START and how did it stand at the time you joined our delegation to
                        START?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: The purpose of START was to pick up after the signed but unratified SALT II
                    treaty. The objective was to move ahead on trying to control what the U. S. saw
                    as a dangerous asymmetry in the weapons systems of the U. S. and the Soviet
                    Union. The Soviets had a large number of very large and very powerful missiles,
                    specifically the SS-18 missile, which could carry up to something like 15
                    warheads.</p>
                <p>The whole business of independently targeting these separate warheads had just
                    begun to emerge and was theoretically possible. At the time we had a missile on
                    the drawing board but actually had no deployed missile that could do this. This
                    subject was debated endlessly in the newspapers and magazines, in Congress, in
                    the bars, and that kind of thing. Our missile which can do this is now called
                    the “Peacekeeper.” Our “Peacekeeper” was still on the drawing board, and we
                    hadn't fired a single one. The Soviets already had the SS-18 produced and
                    deployed. We had more warheads than the Soviets did by a substantial margin.
                    However, we didn't have the ability of getting the “bang for the buck” which
                    they did with these huge missiles. That was seen as a danger to the U.S., and we
                    wanted to get some kind of agreement which would start getting rid of what we
                    called “these asymmetries.”</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>On the other hand the Soviets felt that our cruise missiles were a great danger
                    to them because we had all of these long range airplanes which they didn't have.
                    We had a much larger strategic air force than they had. With our cruise
                    missiles, we could do “stand off” deliveries of nuclear warheads without
                    endangering our flight crews and that sort of thing. These cruise missiles would
                    be much harder to track than aircraft. Then, when the whole issue of “stealth”
                    aircraft leaked out, the Soviets went “berserk”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain what “stealth” aircraft are?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: “Stealth” technology uses both materials and configurations of aircraft to
                    reduce or even, in some cases, eliminate the radar “image” of an airplane or
                    cruise missile, The Soviets probably feared this technology more than they
                    needed to, but we “pumped this up” [publicized it] more than it really amounted
                    to, just to “scare” them. Once reports of this technology leaked out, the Soviet
                    view was that “stealth” technology could make an aircraft or missile invisible
                    to their radar. That was when we caught them building a huge, “phased array”
                    radar near Krasnoyarsk [in Siberia]. They were trying to “catch up” on the
                    possibilities of “stealth” technology so that they could “see” these “stealth”
                    aircraft. It was a very “combative” period. Of course, President Reagan had
                    referred to the Soviet Union as the “Evil Empire,” and the Secretary of Defense
                    referred to President Jaruzelski of Poland as nothing but a Russian in a Polish
                    uniform.</p>
                <p>There were very bad feelings between the U.S. and the Soviet Union at the time,
                    so the negotiations that I went into in the spring of 1981 were far from
                    affable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did these negotiations go, and what were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I was the Executive Secretary of the U. S. Delegation and one of the seven
                    “Members” on the Delegation made up of Gen. Rowny, as the Chairman, five Members
                    representing each of the entities involved in the negotiation (State Department,
                    Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Defense Department,
                    and CIA), and a seventh Member who was the Executive Secretary and day-to-day
                    manager of the delegation.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>As Executive Secretary, I played a rather strange role in all of this. I acted in
                    most senses as A Deputy to General Rowny. The State Department representative
                    was Ambassador Jim Goodby, who was the titular “deputy” to Rowny” on the
                    delegation. However, Rowny apparently felt Jim was a “liberal” and was willing
                    to negotiate away too much to the Soviets. So I was both the “manager” of the
                    delegation and “acted” as deputy to Rowny in many instances. I had a lieutenant
                    colonel and a couple of other people working for me. In effect, I was the chief
                    management officer of the Delegation to the START talks. Rowny turned to me in
                    this role, rather than to Goodby, except on formal occasions. For example, when
                    Rowny was not present for some reason, Goodby chaired delegation meetings. My
                    other principal responsibility, a traditional role of the Executive Secretary,
                    was to chair of the policy working groups which we convened. These consisted of
                    the professional staffs of each of the other Members: civilians at the GS-15 [a
                    CSC, or Civil Service Commission rank] level, and military/naval officers at the
                    colonel or lieutenant colonel level. These delegation “Advisors,” as they were
                    called, wrote the drafts of issue papers, plenary statements, and delegation
                    reports, and other documents which were then discussed and, if possible, agreed
                    upon by the Advisors group under my chairmanship. Agreement was by no means
                    assured, however, because each of the Advisors represented his or her own Agency
                    views, and the uniformed Advisors often pushed their individual Service
                    positions. In addition, there was a tendency on the part of the Advisors to
                    re-open issues which had been resolved or fought to a stalemate in the
                    interagency arena in Washington. This happened at the Members' level also.</p>
                <p>We had at least one Advisors meeting virtually every morning, except when we were
                    having a “plenary meeting” with the Soviets. Plenaries were on Tuesdays and
                    Thursdays I'll get to the “plenaries” in a minute. So three days a week we would
                    have at least one meeting of the policy group, and sometimes two..</p>
                <p>The problem was that this was the period when the “two “Richard's” were fighting
                    it out on arms control policy in Washington. That is, Richard Perle, Department
                    of Defense] and Richard Burt [Department of State]. Richard Perle was Assistant
                    Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. Richard Burt started
                    out as Director of Political-Military Affairs in the State Department, but later
                    moved over as Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs. The two
                    “Richard's” were at each other all the time. It wasn't that they were that far
                    apart on policy, but it was a question of how to go at it and who was going to
                    be “first.” It was a “bloody” struggle. Another twist was that the professionals
                    in State and ACDA by and large tended to be more liberal or flexible than
                    General Rowny and the Defense Department professionals. That situation, of
                    course, “rolled off” on us at the Delegation meetings, particularly in the
                    policy meetings.</p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Side A of Tape 4 of the interview with Don Tice.
                        You were saying that policy meetings within the U. S. Delegation, in
                        preparation for plenary meetings with the Soviets, became very
                        “bloody.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes, these were the meetings of the policy advisory committee. At first the
                    meetings would go on endlessly because we couldn't get agreement. Finally I
                    imposed a rule that no meeting would last more than one hour, and we wouldn't
                    have more than two of these meetings a day. If they did not come to a consensus
                    on language and issues to be forwarded to Delegation Principals by the end of
                    the hour, then I, as Executive Secretary, would take the issues forward to the
                    Principals meeting where I would explain the various positions and
                    disagreements, and then the fight could take place among the Principals..
                    However, Gen. Rowny knew that the Principals themselves did not like to have
                    decisions handed back to them. They wanted something that had already been
                    worked out at a lower level. That tactic worked, and I got the experts group
                    into the mode of either agreeing or agreeing to disagree, and then moving the
                    issue on to the “principals.” It was the only way to avoid sitting in that room
                    for I don't know how many hours a day. A side note: we were then still in the
                    “naive” days of what one knew about electronic surveillance. We met in a
                    supposedly “secure” room. In retrospect, have my doubts about the room's
                    “security”, but that was a long time ago.</p>
                <p>It was a very “tense” time. We had secure phones s our Members and Advisors could
                    contact their Agencies back in Washington. I think we originally had two secure
                    phones and then we got a third one, because it was impossible to operate with
                    only two secure phones. The State and Defense Departments always had to get back
                    in contact with their bosses for guidance. Rowny also wanted a secure phone to
                    talk to ACDA or to Richard Perle in Defense, with whom he had a long-standing
                    relationship dating back to SALT negotiations.. The JCS representative also
                    wanted to use a secure phone to contact the Joint Staff Service to clear
                    positions and get research done. There just weren't enough secure telephones. So
                    whenever the Members' meeting ended, they would all head for the secure
                    telephones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was this meeting taking place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: This was in Geneva in a building located on Rue de Lausanne, on the
                    waterfront of Lake Geneva.. It was a pleasant place. This building that had been
                    constructed by Berney Kornfeld, the owner of IOS, Investors' Overseas Services.
                    He had built the building and planned the top floor as his “bunny pad” [place
                    for assignations with women] or something like that. He got in trouble with the
                    law before he finished the building. At some point ACDA picked up the building
                    on a lease. We had our plenary meetings on the top floor [that is, the “bunny
                    pad”] of what had been the IOS building.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Congress play a sort of “over the horizon” role in
                        this negotiation with the Soviets? I'm thinking in particular of some
                        Members of Congress and Senators who felt very strongly about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Some of them weren't just “over the horizon.” They were right in our
                    knickers. They came to Geneva and wanted to “sit in” on the negotiations. That
                    presented a problem, because a Senator or Congressman coming to Geneva to
                    “attend the negotiations” would insist on sitting in on Plenary Sessions. Rowny
                    held his ground on this, even when it involved his good friends on Capitol Hill.
                    He said: “We cannot do that, because if we do, we'll have demands from the
                    Soviets to do the same kind of thing, and things will get out of hand. So we
                    just can't break that line. Members of Congress can sit in on our delegation
                    meetings and on the meetings of our advisers. We'll arrange for Members of
                    Congress to have conversations with Viktor Karpov, the Chairman of the Soviet
                    Delegation. However, they can't sit in on plenary meetings with the Soviets.”
                    Once the Members of Congress learned that they couldn't sit in on the
                    negotiations, making it possible for them to say: “As I was sitting in on the
                    negotiations in Geneva...” that paled for most of them.</p>
                <p>There were a few Members of Congress who still would come over to Geneva and
                    spend several days with us. We always made it clear to them that we didn't run
                    an Embassy in Geneva and didn't have people to take care of them. We said that
                    we would make hotel reservations for them and would get them passes to our
                    building. However, we told them that that was it, and they were on their own
                    from that point on. The Congressmen and Senators who did come to Geneva, unless
                    they brought their own infrastructure, would have to depend on the American
                    Embassy farther up the hill from our office. This Embassy was headed by an
                    Ambassador and was known as our Mission to the United Nations Offices in Geneva.
                    This Ambassador would receive them, but the Members of Congress and Senators had
                    come to Geneva to talk about the arms control negotiations, which the Ambassador
                    had nothing to do with. We tried to have as little to do with these
                    Congressional visitors as we could. And for very good reasons.</p>
                <p>What really irritated us was that this was the genesis or the early period of the
                    so-called “Staffdels” [Congressional Staff Delegation]. This has come to plague
                    everybody in the Foreign Service. That is, senior or even some junior staff
                    members of individual Congressmen, Senators, or committees travel as if they
                    were members of Congress, using Congressional appropriations. They would insist
                    on getting into everything. That was a pain in the neck. We had people from
                    “Staffdels” around our necks a lot of the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Soviets? How did they
                        negotiate and what were they after?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>TICE: Well, they were trying to limit our technology. They wanted limits on
                    cruise missiles, on bombers, and on our development of certain other
                    technologies in the missile field. They wanted limits on certain types of
                    testing because they knew that we could do a lot more than they could do. Our
                    whole nuclear and rocket program was a lot more sophisticated than theirs was.
                    They tried to keep up with us by employing “brute force and size.” We kept up
                    our end much more by employing advanced technology and finesse.</p>
                <p>This was their objective. They sort of had a “mirror image” of our delegation,
                    although they had a lot more military and KGB [Soviet secret police] members in
                    it. Of course, we could never be sure “who was what.” They knew who our CIA guy
                    was, because he was not from the clandestine side of CIA. He was a civil servant
                    in Washington who had been working in this area for years. So they knew who he
                    was. We suspected and, in some areas, knew who their KGB people were, but that
                    wasn't general knowledge, even among the U. S. Delegation. The Soviets varied a
                    lot in quality but, by and large, they had high quality people. Indeed, they had
                    very, very bright and dedicated people.</p>
                <p>Viktor Karpov, the Chairman of the Soviet Delegation, was a rather “rambunctious,
                    hard-nosed bully of a man.” He and Rowny were well matched. Rowny would not take
                    any guff from him, and they would occasionally exchange “sharp words. However,
                    the negotiations themselves were “choreographed” in advance. I use this word on
                    purpose. They were arranged in a very interesting way. We had two “plenary
                    sessions” a week, one on Tuesday and one on Thursday. These plenary sessions
                    were very carefully “scripted.” One would be at our facility and the next one
                    would be at the Soviet facility. We alternated on days. These sessions would
                    normally start at 11:00 AM. The host delegation for that day, Members and
                    Advisors, would line up, and would shake hands with every Member and Advisor of
                    the visiting delegation as they came in. The Soviets would sit on one side of a
                    long table, with their Ambassador in the middle. Then we would sit on the
                    opposite side of the table, with our Ambassador opposite the Soviet Ambassador.
                    The host Ambassador for the day would welcome the “visiting Delegation” and
                    offer the visiting Ambassador the courtesy of making the first statement in the
                    plenary session. At this point the visiting Ambassador would read the plenary
                    statement, which would be simultaneously interpreted into the other language.
                    Each side brought their own interpreter.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>After the statements by the two Ambassadors were finished, the host Ambassador
                    would ask the visiting Ambassador if he and his Delegation could join the host
                    Delegation for refreshments. All present would have a stretch, pick up whatever
                    was being served that day to eat along with a non-alcoholic beverage, and that
                    was when the negotiating began. We would split up into six, different groups,
                    that is, the Delegation Chiefs, Defense Group, Military Group, the Diplomatic
                    Group, Arms Control Group, and Executive Secretaries.. One of the curious things
                    about this arrangement was that, by tradition, all of these groups had
                    interpreters except for the Executive Secretaries, who sat “one on one.” It was
                    always arranged so that the Executive Secretaries had a language in common. In
                    my case, while I spoke Bulgarian and Serbian, I didn't speak Russian. So they
                    always had an English-speaking person opposite me. I only dealt with two
                    different Soviets during the entire, three years that I was there. Note that
                    there was not an “intelligence” group, since nobody could admit to being
                    intelligence. Therefore, our CIA Member and Advisor sat with other groups,
                    depending on the topics of the day and their interests.</p>
                <p>In the Executive Secretaries group, we always first talk about any arrangements
                    which need agreement, and then would get into substance, which could cover
                    matters clear across the board. The interesting thing for me in that arrangement
                    was that this was in response to a desire expressed by the Soviets. Since there
                    were always multiple people and interpreters in the other groups, you didn't
                    have “deniability” for anything you said in them. The only group in which you
                    could raise a “what if” question and have deniability was that of the Executive
                    Secretaries. In addition, we suspected that the Soviets wanted this so that the
                    Soviet delegation chairman would have a place he could float ideas or make
                    inquiries where his own KGB would not be a party to the exchange.</p>
                <p>So I was used by my Ambassador and my opposite number on the Soviet side was used
                    by his Ambassador to raise issues that we absolutely wanted to be able to deny
                    had ever been discussed, if it came to that. It was a kind of curious
                    arrangement. These talks and “post plenary bilaterals,” as they were called,
                    would generally start at about 11:45 AM. Sometimes they would run until 5:00 PM.
                    It was really “brutal,” because you ran out of things to say and you just
                    “chewed” on each other. This was particularly the case at this time. We were
                    really so far apart on most issues that we would just sit and “growl” at each
                    other. It was particularly painful for me and my Soviet counterpart. we'd just
                    start talking about anything, including literature, books, travel, and
                    whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You began these sessions during this 1981-1983 period,
                        when the Reagan administration was just entering office. As with many
                        administrations, particularly with an “ideological” President like Ronald
                        Reagan, I would assume that it would take most of the first term for him to
                        appreciate that negotiations on these issues, particularly with the Soviets,
                        had to get practical and not remain ideological, if we were going to deal
                        with them effectively. Did you have the feeling that all of you on the
                        Delegation were just “holding the line” and keeping the lines of
                        communication open?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: That's very much what one of the military members of the Delegation said.
                    He put it very well when he said: “This is primarily an underbrush clearing
                    operation.” There were so many questions to be resolved about the definitions of
                    things. For example, there were the characteristics that did or didn't have an
                    impact on a particular definition, in terms of weaponry and so forth. I loved
                    some of the terminology. For example, there was a “FROD,” which was a
                    Functionally Related Observable Detail.. A “FROD” was not just an irrelevant
                    detail. It related to some function that gave the aircraft a specific
                    capability. There was even agreement that on some aircraft the functions that
                    provided its capabilities had to be “observable,” so that you knew that a given
                    aircraft had a given capability. We got into a lot of that. What this meant was
                    that, in terms of identifying this kind of thing, a lot of the work that was
                    done was useful. When the time came for real negotiations, this kind of detail
                    had already been taken care of, and we didn't have to hold everything up while
                    all of this was done. After the initial “shock” of sitting down and “chewing on”
                    each other, we all began to realize this. This was the way things went for the
                    better part of three years.</p>
                <p>Now you will probably remember what was referred to as “the walk in the
                    woods.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: That was in the summer of 1983. Paul Nitze thought that he had agreement
                    with the interagency group and President Reagan to try to make a “breakthrough”
                    on the intermediate range negotiations. We very much wanted to get the Soviet
                    intermediate range, nuclear weapons “off the board.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those were the SS-20 missiles, which were targeted on
                        Western Europe from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: That's right. It was the SS-20 missiles that we wanted to get “off the
                    board.” The Soviets also saw us coming up with our own missiles, which we hadn't
                    yet deployed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Pershing II rocket and the Ground Launched Cruise
                        Missiles.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>TICE: Yes. The cruise missile, also known as GLCM [Ground Launched Cruise
                    Missile], was always there in the background. The Soviets considered the cruise
                    missiles “strategic” and insisted that they should be handled in the strategic
                    missile, or START, negotiations, instead of the INF, or Intermediate Nuclear
                    Force negotiations, in which Paul Nitze headed the U. S. Delegation.</p>
                <p>In an attempt to “break through,” and he thought that he had interagency
                    agreement to do this, Nitze basically went off “blind” with Yuri Kvitzinski.
                    Nitze and Kvitzinski just told the two delegations to continue to sit and talk,
                    while they literally went off mountain climbing and for a “walk in the woods.”
                    They talked about “what if's” and “how could we's,” and They came up with a
                    draft agreement between them which cut through the major issues and would have
                    led to a fairly rapid conclusion of the INF negotiations.</p>
                <p>That draft agreement was brought back to Washington at the end of our summer
                    session in 1983. Its existence was “very closely held.” I remember that even my
                    boss, Rowny, wasn't privy to it. He knew that something was going on, but he
                    couldn't put his finger on it. He was calling up and “pumping” Richard Perle in
                    the Defense Department to try to find out what was going on. I'm not sure that
                    Perle was fully aware of what was involved in this draft agreement. The two
                    delegations [that is, for the START talks and the INF negotiations] were
                    simultaneously in Geneva and came back to Washington at the same time, because
                    the two sets of negotiations were interrelated. Washington wanted to make sure
                    that they were kept synchronized.</p>
                <p>When the two U.S. Delegation came back to Washington, the opposition to this
                    agreement was centered around people like Richard Perle and people that he
                    represented in the more conservative side of the arms control community. As I
                    understand it, Perle went straight to President Reagan. I don't know this from
                    my own, first hand knowledge, but this is what I have been told. Perle was the
                    instrument in getting the draft INF agreement “killed.”</p>
                <p>When we returned to Geneva in the fall of 1983, the Soviets did not want to
                    negotiate any further on the INF side. They had gotten “fed up” on the strategic
                    side as well. So when we came up to the end of the negotiating session, in late
                    November or early in December, 1983, we wanted an agreement on a starting date
                    for the next session. However, the Soviets declined to set a date. That was it.
                    Basically, they walked out on the negotiations. That ended that phase of the
                    negotiations on START and a possible INF agreement.</p>
                <p>The ironic thing is that more than two years later, after many more negotiating
                    sessions and a significant change on the part of the Reagan administration in
                    how it viewed this process, basically the draft agreement which Paul Nitze and
                    Yuri Kvitzinski had negotiated in the walk in the woods was what we got. That
                    is, the INF treaty. You asked whether there was ever any time when we saw some
                    progress. That was the only time in that whole, three-year period that we saw
                    any progress.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think of this as an “intense” type of negotiations. This
                        may be the wrong term, but this sounds almost like the “Stockholm Hostage
                        Syndrome,” with all of you together with your Soviet counterparts working on
                        this issue. Did you begin to think that you were all part of something and
                        that everybody else was against you, or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Well, no, we didn't see all that much of our Soviet counterparts outside of
                    the formal negotiating sessions. We had sort of “set piece” receptions and that
                    kind of thing. However, at that time they were not all of that much ready to go
                    out with us socially. They could never go “one on one.” There always had to be
                    at least two of them. Many of the Soviets didn't bring their wives. We tended to
                    have our wives there. As a result, there wasn't a lot of social inter-action
                    between the delegations. I probably saw as much of them socially when I went out
                    jogging in the early mornings along the shores of Lake Geneva, as I did at
                    evening events.</p>
                <p>What we in the American Delegation got tired of was each other. We were jammed
                    into tiny offices. There were about 45 official Americans on the START
                    Delegation and a like number on the INF Delegation. We had two floors in this
                    IOS building. All of us tended to live at the same hotels and all of that. We
                    got pretty bored, frankly. After the first START session, actually at the
                    beginning of the second session, I went to Gen. Rowny and said: “Look, General,
                    right now we're holding everybody to five day work weeks. Let's set up a Duty
                    Officer system. We have plenary sessions with the Soviets on Tuesdays and
                    Thursdays. We prepare for them on Mondays and Wednesdays, and we use Fridays for
                    a 'wrap up' session. We don't need to have everybody hanging around to wrap up
                    the week's activity. Let's set up a rotation system so that most people can get
                    a three-day weekend now and then. We work very long hours and very intensively.
                    Let's let people get out of town.”</p>
                <p>Rowny agreed. He said: “Okay, set it up, but I have to be sure that I have the
                    principal or the deputy of each agency on hand. You or your deputy, Colonel
                    Chernay has to be available. I must be sure of that.” I said: “We'll work it
                    out.” So we did that, and I think that the INF Delegation had already begun to
                    move toward that kind of arrangement. They were a little more “laid back” than
                    the START Delegation. That arrangement helped take the tension off. As a
                    “principal” on the START Delegation, I had a car and driver assigned to me. When
                    the driver left at 6:00 PM, he dropped the keys to the car on my desk, so I had
                    a car available which I could drive in the evenings and on weekends. It was a
                    rental car with no mileage limitations, so my wife and I would go out of Geneva
                    on most weekends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then at the end of 1983 you left that assignment. The
                        START negotiations were not continued. So what happened then?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>TICE: That was when I went to the “satellite negotiations.” These covered much of
                    1984 and 1985. We had a preparatory conference in the summer of 1984 for the
                    1985 administrative radio conference. The Soviets had “walked out” of the START
                    negotiations in December, 1983, so it was January or February, 1984, when I
                    joined our delegation to the WARC [World Administrative Radio Conference]
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>I could have stayed around with the START delegation, but when we were in
                    Washington, Rowny got very restive. He was sometimes a difficult man to work
                    for, although I've got a lot of respect for him. When he didn't have enough to
                    do, he could drive his staff “nuts.” I really didn't want to sit around on
                    detail to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency [ACDA] for a long period of
                    time. So I moved on to the WARC negotiations.</p>
                <p>As I said, we held the preparatory conference in 1984 and then the space WARC
                    itself in the summer of 1985. I then stayed around in the fall of 1985, “writing
                    up” and polishing the final report and getting interagency clearances on it,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it is now 1985, and you are leaving the START
                        delegation. What happened next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: About the time I had decided to look for another assignment, an old friend
                    of mine from my inspecting days called and said “Hey, how would you like to go
                    into international telecommunications?” I said: “I don't know anything about
                    international telecommunications.” He said: “Never mind, we need somebody at the
                    senior level to be the chief policy person on a delegation a year from now.” At
                    this point preparations were already under way for our participation in the
                    conference of the International Telecommunications Union [ITU]. This was a World
                    Administrative Radio Conference, better known as a WARC, at which and issues
                    regarding the use of the, geostationary satellite orbit and the radio
                    frequencies associated with it were sorted out.</p>
                <p>The Geostationary Satellite Orbit or “GSO” is a band about 10 miles wide circling
                    the globe some 2,300 miles above the equator. These satellites basically stay in
                    one place in relation to the earth if they are inserted into orbit the correct
                    speed and positioning. That is why these satellites are called
                    “geostationary.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get the dates when you were dealing with this
                        matter, and then we'll go into the particular issues. You were in that
                        office from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I was there from March of 1984 until the late fall of 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the team working on this, when
                        you were preparing for this conference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: The interagency team was just in the process of being formed. The person
                    who had been brought in to be the overall and technical leader for this
                    negotiating effort was Harold Kimball, an aerospace and frequency engineer from
                    NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]. Hal Kimball was one of the
                    top frequency and satellite “gurus” [experts] in the U. S. Government. I joined
                    him as the senior foreign policy adviser to the effort.</p>
                <p>Interestingly enough, the person who was made Chairman of the U.S. Delegation was
                    Dean Burch, who may be remembered as former Chairman of the Federal
                    Communications Commission (FCC), appointed by President Nixon. A one-time
                    Congressional staffer, Burch was Barry Goldwater's campaign manger when
                    Goldwater ran for President. Under Nixon, in addition to being FCC Chairman, he
                    served on two occasions on the Nixon White House staff as one of the
                    “Counselors,” one of the cabinet level people. The first such assignment was
                    very early in the Nixon administration. Then he was brought back in as a
                    “trouble shooter” during the Watergate Affair. An amusing sidelight, when person
                    of Cabinet rank leaves that office, he or she traditionally is given the chair
                    which he or she used at formal cabinet meetings. Since he was Counselor twice,
                    Burch received two such chairs, which he had sitting in his office. When he was
                    appointed Chairman of the U.S. Delegation to this international conference, he
                    was a senior partner in Pearson, Ball, and Dowd, one of the big law firms in
                    Washington, D. C., which deals in communications matters, among other
                    things.</p>
                <p>Burch, who died of cancer in the early 1990s, was a “legend in his own time. He
                    grew up in Texas and on Alcatraz [prison on an island in San Francisco Bay],
                    where his father was a guard. So, as he said, “I learned my English sort of
                    backing into being polite.” [Laughter] He was very much a “no nonsense” kind of
                    guy. For the WARC delegation, Burch picked an “inner group” (from the larger,
                    formal inter-agency group), which included representatives from the Department
                    of Commerce (represented by the NTIA [National Telecommunications Information
                    Administration, one of the major Commerce Bureaus]); the FCC, the Department of
                    State, and from the U. S. military, a huge user of radio frequencies. Also
                    included were a couple of representatives of industry, who were chosen not so
                    much for the companies they represented as for their personal, broad knowledge
                    of the technologies involved, the international telecom negotiating arena, and
                    the views of the telecommunications industry. This group, which was Burch called
                    his “cabinet,” did most of the skull work on planning for this international
                    conference. Hal Kimball and I were both key members, and we generally met
                    privately with Burch to map strategy in dealing with the “cabinet.” We also did
                    quite a lot of traveling around the world, visiting the governments of various
                    countries that we wanted to line up on our side in the battle over radio
                    frequencies that was shaping up.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>The principal issue, briefly, was that some Third World nations had decided the
                    geostationary satellite orbit was a “resource” for all mankind, just like the
                    floor of the oceans. They were pushing a system which would give the Third World
                    in general, and equatorial countries in particular, a large measure of control
                    over the assignment of orbital slots on the GSO, and allocation of frequencies
                    associated with them. This, of course, was absolutely ridiculous, because it
                    would have been the perfect way to stop “dead in its tracks” the development of
                    this resource. That was the battle which was joined at this international
                    conference which took place in Geneva [Switzerland] in the summer of 1985. It
                    was officially called, common term of reference for the conference was “Space
                    WARC”.</p>
                <p>The conference ran for nine weeks, and it was nine long, hard weeks of work
                    because we were constantly trying to influence other countries to amend their
                    positions and to keep some cohesion in the Western bloc. Of course, the Soviet
                    bloc was just that, at that time. Curiously, though, while the Soviets always
                    wanted to figure out ways of making life difficult for us, fundamentally their
                    interests were exactly the same as ours. They didn't want a bunch of Third World
                    countries telling them how to use radio frequencies. So this was an interesting
                    experience in that regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with Third World countries? Were
                        they gratuitously “difficult”? They had no satellites to put up and they had
                        no real control over satellites. In effect, they were laying claim to a
                        piece of space.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Their position was ridiculous from the start. Even some of the Third World
                    countries recognized this, but they didn't want to break “Third World
                    solidarity,” although we finally managed to lever in and begin to break that up.
                    One of the leading Third World countries in this was Algeria, which appeared
                    “hell bent” on causing as many problems as possible for the Western European
                    countries and the United States. At times this involved very “tense” discussions
                    and sometimes considerable “tacking” in terms of the tactics that were used.</p>
                <p>However, WARC conference finally came out to a basic “stand off” with results
                    which could be interpreted by either side in the way it wanted. The U. S. and
                    the developed countries were left free to go right ahead and pretty much do what
                    they wanted to do. However, it was a real fight. If we hadn't had that outcome,
                    it could have been disastrous, either raising the price of, or limiting access
                    to one of the primary resources available at that time for international
                    non-wired communications</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>This conference made it possible for me to see the U.S., with the right kind of
                    leadership, could take decisive action taken in a difficult situation. It became
                    clear as the conference neared its end that the then Secretary General was not
                    prepared to force the kind of votes that he could lead to an outcome even
                    minimally acceptable to the developed countries. Just three days before the
                    conference was to end, Dean Burch called him up and said: “I have to come and
                    see you.” He went to see him and said: “Dick, this is the position that we're
                    taking. You'd better see that we prevail in it, or we're going to walk out, and
                    this conference is going to fail. Responsibility for this outcome is going to be
                    right on your doorstep. You've got one choice. Either you go with us, the
                    British, the French, and the Germans or the conference fails, and it will be on
                    your shoulders.” We received a report later on that when Burch walked out of the
                    Secretary General's office, the Secretary General burst into tears! However,
                    this tactic worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the chairman of the conference from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: From Australia. I haven't used his name because he is a nice guy and is
                    still active in the satellite business world. His mistake was not understanding
                    that the developed nations, with many billions of dollars invested in satellite
                    communications, would have to walk away from the treaty and the ITU if the
                    compromise he was heading for prevailed. It was one of those instances where, if
                    we had had a non political type as Chairman of our delegation, we wouldn't have
                    had that outcome. Burch simply had the authority, and the confidence in his own
                    authority, to do something like that. He just did it and reported back to
                    Washington. There wasn't any question of “asking” Washington for guidance. He
                    also did not seek consensus of the other major Western players. He just told
                    them what he had done after the fact. They, in the main, were quite relieved to
                    have had their chestnuts pulled from the fire without having had to be exposed
                    to the heat. Before he went to see the ITU head, Burch had meeting with the
                    ranking person from all of the U.S. Government agencies represented on the
                    delegation. He told them what he was going to do, said that he didn't want any
                    of them reporting back or telling their agencies in Washington until after he
                    had done it and had the results in his hand; and he would do the reporting. He
                    told them that they would be “off the delegation” if they did not follow his
                    instructions. [Laughter] This was effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Otherwise, somebody could start “crossing” you and...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>TICE: Yes. We had one instance of a person with one of the U. S. Government
                    agencies going back and “pumping up” his agency head about a position that Burch
                    was taking. That agency head went to the White House. The White House called
                    Burch, who explained to the White House “where they could go” or get themselves
                    a new Ambassador. They had hired him and were stuck with him. Then Burch backed
                    that agency representative into a corner and told him that that was the only
                    mistake that he would be allowed. He would be immediately sent home if he did
                    anything like that again. A report of that got around, and we didn't have any
                    more problems like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the U. S. military? I speak with a great deal
                        of confidence, having heard something about frequencies on National Public
                        Radio yesterday afternoon while driving home. So I speak with a great deal
                        of expertise! However, apparently, the American military has “staked out” a
                        certain spectrum of frequencies which is particularly good for “digital”
                        transmissions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apparently, the spectrum which we have left for digital
                        transmissions in the United States doesn't go around buildings, or something
                        like that. However, apparently the Europeans have taken what we call a
                        “military spectrum” and given it to civilians. Was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: It is a problem. I think that it's one which is on the way to being solved.
                    It was more of a problem, say, five to 10 years ago than I think it is now. The
                    U. S. military is now beginning to give up some of the spectrum down at the
                    lower end of the scale, down in the 360 to 500 megahertz range. They are more
                    accommodating, both because they are under pressure and because they are
                    basically “trading up” to reserved chunks of the spectrum in the higher
                    frequency ranges.</p>
                <p>The U. S. military will be all right. One of the key issues involving the use of
                    the radio spectrum is that our ability to find ways to “reuse” or “compress” all
                    of those military frequencies and to make greater use of the spectrum available
                    has always moved up and out ahead faster than the requirements for it. It isn't
                    as if anybody is being deprived of spectrum. Now, it is true that in the lower
                    ranges, where you are now getting requirements for digital telephone use, and
                    all that kind of thing, this is creating a limit on the number of people,
                    companies, or entities that you can allow to put up a satellite and go into the
                    telephone business.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>The currently-emerging “Lower Earth Orbit” or LEO technology, for satellite also
                    is easing the pressure on frequencies. These are “little guys” which are in
                    elliptical orbits much closer to Earth. Their area of coverage is smaller.
                    However, if you put up a bunch of them, you can ensure relatively full coverage.
                    I believe that Motorola's initial system, called the “Iridium System,” is
                    planned for something like 80 satellites, which will overlap coverage on various
                    orbits around the world. As a result, when this system is in place and up and
                    running, you will be able to pull out your “hand held” receiver any place in the
                    world, hit the “transmit button,” and, with a little “whip antenna,” be within
                    reach of a satellite that can pick you up and connect you with anyplace in the
                    world That's what will eventually lead to having a telephone number like a
                    Social Security Number which you'll use wherever you go and have for the rest of
                    your life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period, was there an organization that
                        everyone, including other countries, reported to when you were putting up a
                        satellite? Do you say that you want this satellite up in “X” sector or
                        something like that? Do you have to get clearance for sending up a satellite
                        in this way? Otherwise, I think that you'd have a “space problem.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Permission to launch a communications satellite on the GSO is coordinated
                    by the ITU. It has become one of its more important functions. Before you put up
                    a satellite, you have to describe to the ITU its various characteristics in
                    terms of power, the frequencies used, the intended service area, all of the
                    things that it would be doing, and what they call “antenna rolloff.” In other
                    words, when you are focusing your antenna for a particular service area, you are
                    required to state how much of the transmissions using the satellite “creep out”
                    to one side or another or “leaks off” in a way that would interfere with
                    something else. When you put in the request to the ITU to register that
                    satellite, the ITU circulates it to all other countries and satellite operators
                    and asks: “Will this proposed satellite, using this much power and in these
                    frequencies harm your existing interests?”</p>
                <p>As a result of this kind of coordination it sometimes happens that somebody will
                    say: “Yes, it will harm us.” Then you have to define what the service areas are,
                    how to change the antenna characteristics, and all of those things which need to
                    be worked out to ensure that there is no interference. Sometimes, you are told
                    by the ITU: “You simply can't have that orbital 'slot' because it is
                    incompatible with other things there. You will have to move down from that
                    point.” Your answer might be: “Well, when you look at that spot along the
                    horizon of our service area, it will require greater power,” and all of that. So
                    it is “too bad” or “too sad” for the proposed satellite. The ITU will conclude:
                    “If you want to service that area, this is the spectrum that you can have.” So
                    that's a very complex and high intensity issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the people in the ITU who run
                        this? I assume that they belong to a sort of international civil
                        service.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>TICE: Yes, they do. Its reputation as a specialized agency in the United Nations
                    system is that it's probably the best managed and organized entity in this
                    system. You simply cannot have people in the ITU who don't know what they're
                    doing. So the ITU is mainly managed and staffed by people from countries all
                    over the world who are knowledgeable in the telecommunications area. They are
                    pretty good.</p>
                <p>However, later on, after I had retired from the Foreign Service, I went to work
                    for Booz-Allen, and Hamilton. I sort of led the way on a proposal to do a
                    management review of the ITU. Booz-Allen won a competitive bid to conduct this
                    management review. I spent most of a year, part of the time in Geneva and part
                    of the time back in Washington, working on that project. We recommended some
                    fundamental changes in how the ITU was organized. What the ITU did first was to
                    appoint a high-level commission of the representatives of 20 countries to hire a
                    consultant. They were the ones who hired Booz-Allen, and Hamilton. We worked
                    with the high-level commission and not with the ITU itself, although it
                    eventually turned out that we worked very closely with Dr. Pekka Tarjanne, the
                    man who was just coming in and is now the Secretary General of the
                    organization.</p>
                <p>As I said, we worked in cooperation with the high-level commission, which had a
                    lot of its own ideas, too. We were able to put substance to many of the ideas
                    and how to proceed in doing this in the context of a comprehensive management
                    audit. Then we dealt with the “business process re-engineering” phase. We were
                    doing this before “re-engineering” had become a popular term. This study
                    resulted in some fundamental changes and reorganizations in the ITU.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what happened in 1985?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Just at the point when I was wrapping up the final draft of the U.S.
                    Delegation report on the Space WARC, I believe it was in November of 1995, I was
                    standing by an elevator one day in the State Department and Bob Lamb, who'd just
                    been named Assistant Secretary for the newly created Bureau of Diplomatic
                    Security, walked by. He was an old friend of mine. He said: “What are you
                    doing?” I said: “Oh, well, I'm going to start looking for a job.” He said: “I've
                    got a job for you.” I said: “Doing what?” He said: “Come to see me, and we'll
                    talk about it.”</p>
                <p>Bob was trying to put together this broadened entity called the Bureau of
                    Diplomatic Security, pulling in disparate elements from around the State
                    Department. However, the core of it was the old Office of Security. He wanted to
                    change the whole nature of that. Up till then many of the people assigned, and
                    it's always unfair to generalize, had been Security Officers. They were very
                    police-oriented and very direct. Culturally, many of them didn't “fit” changing
                    the Foreign Service very well.</p>
                <p>When I went to see Bob, he said: “Tice, I want you for my 'cultural interface'
                    with the rest of the Department.” [Laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was this called, the Office of Diplomatic
                        Security?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: It was called the Bureau of Diplomatic Security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were with them from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: A little less than a year. In the fall of 1986 I undertook a special
                    assignment for Ron Spiers [Under Secretary of State for Management] having to do
                    with technology transfer, that continued until I went to the National Security
                    Council early in 1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point, while you had lots of responsibility in
                        these last two jobs, they were sort of “out of the mainstream of the career
                        Foreign Service.” Therefore, you weren't developing the connections with a
                        geographic bureau and all of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: In part, this was by design. When I took the job as a Foreign Service
                    Inspector, I knew that this was going to be the first of this kind of special
                    assignment. My wife was ill, could not be assigned overseas, and would probably
                    not be so assignable again. So I really couldn't look to take an overseas
                    assignment. I could take temporary assignments and, in fact, she traveled with
                    me a good part of the time in the Inspection Corps and when I went to Geneva, as
                    her health allowed. However, she had periodic relapses and couldn't be cleared
                    for assigned overseas. Taking a posting unaccompanied was not an option so,
                    basically, my career in the traditional Foreign Service was over, and I was
                    merely “riding it out” till I decided to retire, or until I reached
                    Time-in-Class. That was the reason why I took a series of assignments like
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, how did you
                        work as “cultural interface” with the rest of the Department, as Bob Lamb
                        described the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I was put in charge of the Intelligence Unit. Bob used me as a “trouble
                    shooter” and as an “interface” with the rest of the Department. I was the guy
                    whose name he gave to people who would call up and say to him: “Do you know what
                    those security people have done now?” Then he would say: “See Don Tice.”
                    [Laughter] So I was the “flak catcher.” It was a rather interesting job and at
                    an interesting time.</p>
                <p>I left the Bureau of Diplomatic Security just as the “big problem” erupted. That
                    was when the Department found out that our new Embassy Chancery in Moscow had
                    become, in effect, a “tuning fork” for the KGB. Its very structure was turned
                    into a “radio receiver” and, therefore, was inherently insecure. That issue blew
                    up just about the time that I was leaving there..</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>I also “worked Capitol Hill” for Lamb. I went up to committee hearings with him,
                    befriended Congressional staffers, and that kind of stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that problems concerning the new construction
                        of our embassies were sort of turning them into “fortresses” because of the
                        fear of terrorism? There were other consequences. Our embassies no longer
                        were “user friendly.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: That was a big issue. DS [the Bureau of Diplomatic Security] was pushed
                    very hard to turn out embassies into fortresses. Others were pushing very hard
                    to avoid making embassies into fortresses. There was a constant “pull and haul”
                    between those in the traditional Foreign Service and those, with a lot of
                    Congressional backing and pressure, who said: “You have to take care of our
                    people serving abroad.” For a lot of reasons, not the least of which was the
                    bombing of our Embassy in Beirut, it was not a happy time. As I said, we were
                    being pulled and hauled on this issue. We were designing some “pretty awful”
                    embassy buildings but we were being forced to do that, because Congress
                    appropriated $500 million to improve the security of our diplomatic offices
                    overseas. A number of Congressmen said: “By God, you're going to spend that
                    money, not on people, but on buildings.”</p>
                <p>Fortunately, a it turned out, much of that money was never spent. But that wasn't
                    something that we could tell Congress. By the time I had been in DS for about a
                    year, I felt that I had probably outlived my usefulness there.</p>
                <p>Then an interesting thing came along that caused a transition for me. This was
                    during the second Reagan term. The Reagan administration had a lot of
                    businessmen serving it, and business interests were one of our primary concerns.
                    We had an export control policy which had been devised back in the 1950's. It
                    had bureaucratic mechanisms in it, set up in the 1940's and 1950's, when the
                    Cold War began.</p>
                <p>The Secretary of State received an “Eyes Only” telegram from our Ambassador to
                    Belgium, and which was also signed by our Ambassadors to the United Kingdom,
                    France, Germany, and Italy. The thrust of this telegram was: “Why doesn't the
                    State Department start running this export licensing procedure? Export licensing
                    policy is supposed to be in the State Department, but in fact it is being run by
                    the Defense Department. The Defense Department 'browbeats' the Commerce
                    Department, which has the other 'say' in it. Therefore, there's no rationality
                    in it, and American business interests are suffering.”</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>I got a phone call from Ron Spiers, whom I had known for years and who was then
                    the Under Secretary for Management. He said: “Don, can you come down to my
                    office and look at something?” So I went down and read through this telegram,
                    which was really vitriolic. We had lost some big business deals which were under
                    consideration. This particularly affected Belgium, which was why our Ambassador
                    to Belgium wrote this cable. The Ambassadors who signed this cable were all
                    “high powered,” politically appointed Ambassadors.</p>
                <p>Ron Spiers said: “What do you think? Is there anything to this?” I said: “Oh,
                    yes, there is.” He said: “How long would it take you and how much money would
                    you need to get to the bottom of it and come up with some recommendations?” This
                    was in November, 1985. I said: “Well, half of December is about all that you can
                    work, because Europe 'dies' for the Christmas and New Year holidays. Give me
                    till mid-February, [1986].” Ron said: “How much money do you need?” I said:
                    “Well, I need one professional staffer and a secretary. I need to make at least
                    one if not two trips to talk to these Ambassadors and members of their staffs in
                    these Western European Embassies.” And Spiers said: “You've got the job! Go
                    ahead and take care of it.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>That job was great fun. I got all tangled up with Richard Perle again. He was
                    Assistant Secretary of Defense, there was a Perle sympathizer in the Department
                    of Commerce, and the Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Economics and
                    Business (EB) was a Perle prot�g�. They had this whole issue all tangled up. You
                    simply could not export something from the United States if Perle and his
                    friends did not want it exported. They, and the people around them, took the
                    most restrictive approach, particularly when it came to the export of
                    electronics equipment. The U.S. electronics industry was being totally
                    “hamstrung. It could not export its products. Yet the Japanese were “cloning”
                    [copying] our technology, and we had no control over them. That was just one of
                    the reasons that they were just “burying” us in the trade field. This problem
                    involved a lot of other, technical matters, but the primary area of concern was
                    communications, electronics, computers, and so forth.</p>
                <p>So I worked with Capitol Hill, worked with other U. S. Government agencies,
                    talked with people in EB, and then the people EB's Export Control Unit, headed
                    by the Perle acolyte mentioned previously. So Perle had the whole thing “sewn
                    up,” just like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Richard Perle was the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
                        International Security Affairs at the Pentagon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was also a prot�g� of the late Senator “Scoop” Jackson
                        [Democrat, State of Washington].</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>TICE: Yes, he had been a staffer for Senator Jackson, when Jackson was the “big
                    man” in the arms control area. In effect, Richard Perle was Senator Jackson's
                    “think tank.” Perle is a man of great intellect who is very skilled at
                    persuading and reasoning with people, as well as manipulating them. He made his
                    own “agenda” the U. S. “agenda” in the arms control area, to a very large
                    degree. He was an amazingly successful person. I always admired him, even though
                    I disagreed with him a lot.</p>
                <p>At the end of this inquiry I came up with a report. I took it to Ron Spiers and
                    asked him: “Do you want me to 'pull any punches'?” He said: “No, let it all hang
                    out.” So I did this and made recommendations on the reorganization of the Export
                    Control Unit in EB. I proposed the unit be separated completely from EB and be
                    headed by a person with the rank of Ambassador and an appropriate staff, who
                    would report directly to the Deputy Secretary. He had to have ambassadorial or
                    assistant secretary rank to be able to deal with the people like Perle and
                    others, across interagency lines. I documented this recommendation with all of
                    the interviews which I had had in this connection. It was really a lot of fun.
                    The report is about two inches thick. It is an interesting document and
                    bureaucratic study.</p>
                <p>After I dropped this study on Ron Spiers' desk, he went direct to John Whitehead,
                    then Deputy Secretary of State. The routing of this report, sort of the “Tinker
                    to Evers to Chance” [reference to Chicago Cubs infield which recorded numerous
                    “double plays” in baseball] route, was Secretary Shultz to John Whitehead to Ron
                    Spiers. Then Secretary Shultz said: “Whitehead, you take care of this.” So
                    Whitehead took care of it. I briefed him on it and then he read the report. He
                    said: “Okay, I want you to head up a committee to put these recommendations into
                    effect.” So I worked with John Whitehead and with Ron Spiers, the Assistant
                    Secretaries of EB. and EUR [Bureau of European Affairs], as well as the security
                    people, setting up a system for implementing the recommendations I had made. I
                    set up the Ambassador level position and all that kind of stuff. I think that
                    this report resulted in some change in how we got “rolled,” at least.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What Ambassador was appointed to that job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: Bob Dean, then a Deputy Director of the Bureau of Political-Military
                    Affairs, was given the rank of Ambassador and assigned to the slot. He later
                    moved over to the White House, and I worked for him there. He was a political
                    appointee. I think that he did a pretty effective job. That position has
                    probably been long-since abolished. This was a transition arrangement to “clean
                    out” the problems in that I identified.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>At that point I had decided that I was going to retire from the State Department.
                    I think that I had a couple of more years before I would have reached the limit
                    of my time in class as a Foreign Service Officer. One of the things that I had
                    tried to do was to focus the things that I did on matters such as arms control,
                    the world of satellites, the Office of Diplomatic Security, and then this export
                    control program. Experience with these matters would provide good background for
                    later employment. By my lights I would still be a relatively “young man” by the
                    time I left the Foreign Service. I wanted to have something else to do, and that
                    process of preparation “paid off.”</p>
                <p>As I say, I was planning to retire, and was filling out the various papers
                    involved and applying for job search seminar, when the Iran-Contra Affair
                    reached its zenith and Admiral Poindexter and the majority of the professionals
                    on the NSC staff, including Ollie North, were sacked. Frank Carlucci was named
                    to replace Poindexter as National Security Advisor, and he persuaded Colin
                    Powell to return from his three-star job in Europe and become Deputy National
                    Security Advisor. I think something like 50 professionals on the staff were
                    either immediately let go or eventually sent on to other work. Some of them were
                    “escorted out of their offices.” It may have taken a little longer. Carlucci and
                    Powell looking madly for senior Foreign Service, Military, and CIA officers,
                    with known track records to replace them and help put the whole operation
                    together again.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TICE: I went over to the White House staff in February, 1987, and I left there in
                    January, 1989, when the Bush administration came into office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing on the NSC staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I went there nominally to be the deputy, under Bob Dean, in the area
                    handling technology transfer. I did do some of that, but also was asked to
                    handle monitoring and actions with regard to overall foreign affairs funding,
                    also known as the “150 Account.” That was the Office of Management and Budget
                    number for foreign affairs activity. I was asked to handle the “150 Account” in
                    the sense of being the action officer on the NSC staff who would handle problems
                    of conflict among the foreign affairs agencies, or “staff them,” at least, over
                    the allocation of budget funds in the “150 Account.”</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>Since I had recently been working in the interagency arena on international
                    telecommunications policy, I was well aware that, following abolishment of the
                    White House Office of Telecommunications Policy, there was a three-way,
                    interagency battle going on among the Departments of State and Commerce and the
                    FCC [Federal Communications Commission over who would determined
                    telecommunications policy. That was an issue which hadn't been resolved, even
                    with the appointment of an Ambassador to head a bureau to determine
                    telecommunications policy in the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me stop here to turnover the tape.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Side B of Tape 4 of the interview with Donald
                        Tice. Please continue, Don.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: I had observed this conflict first hand during my Space WARC experience,
                    and knew that it was still going on and was destructive t our policy process in
                    the telecommunications area.</p>
                <p>So, I will agreed to handle the '150 Account' but said I would also like to
                    handle International Telecommunications Policy.” They said: “Fine. You're it!”
                    [Laughter] I had a staff of three people, including one military officer. That
                    is, I had a staff of two civilians and a couple of secretaries, plus one
                    military officer. One of the civilians with me was a senior USIA [United States
                    Information Agency] officer. During the earlier Reagan years there had been a
                    USIA, or information policy person, who had gotten tangled up in the “Iran
                    Contra” controversy. I think that, in effect, he became a “Disinformation
                    Policy” person. I won't name the incumbent in that job, whose office I took. In
                    effect, he had more CIA than USIA in his background. By that time he had become
                    a problem. So they moved him out (literally — he declined to give up his office
                    and had to have his pass lifted and be escorted from the building). His
                    replacement, also a USIA officer, was placed under me under me. And then I also
                    had a couple of Army officers. One of them, then a Major, was extremely bright.
                    I expect that he is general by now.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>We had a good unit there, and I enjoyed that two years. I was, however, glad to
                    give up the “beeper” and the White House pass when the two years were up. We did
                    a lot of interesting stuff, much of it in the budget area. At that time the
                    whole foreign affairs budget was something in the range of $15-19 billion. It
                    was going up from one year to the next. By the time you applied all of the
                    “earmarks to this budget, there wasn't much left. You started out with applying
                    “earmarks” for the Israeli-Egyptian aid programs. However much you gave the
                    Israelis, you had to give the Egyptians a percentage of that figure. The Israeli
                    earmark kept going up each year, and we were advised that this was
                    non-negotiable. Then you had the Greek and Turkish “earmarks.” These were all so
                    highly political that, as I learned once after I got my fingers “burned,” you
                    didn't go into them. Then there were all of the Congressional “earmarks.” It
                    seemed that each Congressman and Senator who was on a committee where he could
                    have any “say” on it, would get his particular, pet “cow” taken care of. It got
                    so bad that you really didn't have any leeway. If you needed $200,000 to take
                    care of a flash fire or emergency of some kind, it simply wasn't available. You
                    had to “break it out of some place.”</p>
                <p>The Defense Department was always the “cash cow” in that connection. They were
                    very tired of that role. So it was a little “hair raising” and fast-paced
                    because, when you start talking about money, it quickly escalates to the cabinet
                    rank, and so I had to be damned careful about what I did.</p>
                <p>I think that one of the funniest things that happened to me was that, at one
                    point, we were really “low” on usable cash and needed some money for something
                    in Africa, I think. The Major in my office and I sat down with one of our
                    colleagues over in the OMB [Office of Management and Budget]. We figured that if
                    we could get a 1% reduction in all of the “earmarks,” that would “free up” a lot
                    of money and would give us some real “elbow room.”</p>
                <p>We were talking about this, and I think that we actually had some language on
                    paper. We had sworn that nobody would talk outside of the three of us until we
                    were ready to take it to Colin Powell. Then, one day, I had a phone call from
                    Colin. He said: “Don, come over and see me.” So I trotted across West Executive
                    Avenue and went into the White House to his office. Powell said: “Don, do you
                    know anything about a proposal to cut the 'earmarks' by 1%?” I said to myself:
                    “Oh, [four letter word].” Colin was laughing at that point. He said: “Good try,
                    but no cigar. I just got a call from Tom Dine.” Dine was then the head of the
                    American Israeli Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC. I guess that I had turned
                    pretty red in the face. I said: “Colin, there were only supposed to be three of
                    us who were even thinking about it, and you would be the fourth to know.” He
                    said: “Well, I guess you included one too many because there it is.” He added:
                    “Good try, but that's finished.” I said: “Okay. We'll go back to the drawing
                    board.”</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>Another time that I had an interesting experience involved one of the most
                    contentious issues in the U. S. Government, refugee policy. Everybody has an ox
                    that can be gored in that connection. There is a whole panoply of organizations,
                    including NGO's or non governmental organizations, which support or are involved
                    with refugees. There was a point at which we were having a problem finding money
                    for processing refugees coming out of the Soviet Union. These were primarily
                    Jews and Armenians. The Soviets had opened up the floodgates, and these refugees
                    were coming out. They all had to go through this tortuous path of going to the
                    American Embassy in Moscow and getting a “false visa” so that they could exit
                    the Soviet Union. The Soviets knew exactly what we were doing. These people,
                    with their “false American visa” could exit the Soviet Union and fly to Vienna,
                    where they were then transferred. Some went directly to the U. S., some went to
                    Israel, some went to other places, and there were whole camps set up in various
                    places which were receiving these people. All in all, it was a huge
                    industry.</p>
                <p>This “pipeline” of Soviet refugees was chugging along. Then our Ambassador to the
                    Soviet Union, Jack Matlock, stuck a big stick in the spokes. For a number of
                    complex reasons the flow of refugees could not continue at that rate, and nobody
                    in Washington was coming to grips with the problem. So, Ambassador Matlock
                    precipitated a crisis by cut off the flow: the Embassy in Moscow stopped issuing
                    visas to these refugees. In the Soviet Union at that time, when somebody applied
                    to the Soviet authorities to get an exit permit, one of three things happened.
                    Either they were immediately sent to jail, they were told “No,” or they were
                    told: “All right, you can have the permit. Now, here's the date when you will go
                    to Moscow. By that time you must give up all of your worldly possessions, except
                    what you can carry with you, you forego everything you own, go to Moscow, get
                    your visa, and leave the Soviet Union.” This arrangement applied to both
                    Armenians and Jews.</p>
                <p>Because these people had divested themselves of all of their worldly goods and
                    were moving in the direction of Moscow or were in the process of doing that,
                    When we stopped issuing visas, the refugees began to “stack up” on the sidewalk
                    in front of the Embassy in Moscow. Of course, television news coverage was
                    already with us, and that was what was showing up in the evening and morning
                    news on Soviet TV.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>Unfortunately, the guy who handled refugees was out of the country at the time.
                    And, the problem was one of money. I got a call from Colin Powell, who had just
                    come back from his 9:00 AM meeting with President Reagan. He said: “Don, have
                    you heard the news about people stacking up in Moscow outside the Embassy?” I
                    said: “Yep!” He said: “Generally, I'd be calling So-and-So but he's off on a
                    trip to Southeast Asia on Vietnamese matters. You're my '150 man' so I guess
                    that this is your baby.” Powell continued: “The President said to me this
                    morning, 'Colin, I want to know what we're going to do about those people on the
                    sidewalk in Moscow. Please let me know by about 4:00 PM this afternoon.'” Colin
                    continued: “Don, please let me know what we're going to do about it by about
                    3:00 PM this afternoon.” [Laughter] I immediately headed back to my office and
                    sat down with the Bob Dean, the Special Assistant to the President that I
                    reported to. I said: “Look, the only thing to do in a short time like this is to
                    get all of the 'miscreants' in the same room.” So we set up a meeting for 11:00
                    AM and just decreed that the Assistant Secretaries in charge of this matter from
                    the Departments of Justice and State, INS [Immigration and Naturalization
                    Service], and at least three additional Assistant Secretaries would attend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From HEW [Department of Health, Education, and
                        Welfare]...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TICE: From HEW; Treasury, of course, because money was involved; OMB [Office of
                    Management and Budget] was involved; and every other department which had a
                    stake in this. Of course the man who then headed European affairs in the NSC was
                    a zealot in taking certain positions on this issue. He was there.
                    Representatives of the intelligence agencies were there, and it was a
                    “madhouse.” We used the big conference room and got them all in there. I had
                    sort of scripted for Dean how we wanted to try to lead them through the problem.
                    It wound up with a shouting match. One Assistant Secretary was shouting
                    four-letter words at another Assistant Secretary from another agency and that
                    kind of thing.</p>
                <p>I had been sitting there beside Dean making notes, as I knew the going-in
                    positions of the various agencies. After about an hour and a half of acrimonious
                    confusion, I wrote out a list of nine “points of agreement”. I put a note at the
                    end of it which said: “Bob, at 1:00 PM sharp you had better 'shut them up,'
                    declare a consensus on these points, and adjourn the meeting.” Well, that's what
                    he did. They all screamed “bloody murder,” but we went back to Colin Powell with
                    this and said that this is what we “agreed on” and suggested that he tell the
                    President that this is what we're going to do. He made a few calls to cabinet
                    members, “stuffed some people back into their holes,” as it were, and then we
                    got this process moving again. [Laughter] It was one of the longest days that
                    I've ever spent.</p>

                    with me when I was working in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. Ralph Shrader,
                    now the President of Booz-Allen's World Technology Business, had been one of the
                    people on the delegation to the ITU. He had been a youngish-looking engineer at
                    Booz-Allen. I got to know Ralph during that period. Somebody else from
                    Booz-Allen had contacted me, and we had chatted and had lunch occasionally. They
                    were just keeping an eye on me, so that when I left the White House staff,
                    they'd have a chance at me. As a matter of fact, while I was still in the White
                    House I signed a contingency, employment offer. It concerned a very large
                    contract which would have built a world-wide ISDN, an integrated services
                    digital network, for U. S. Government international communications, under the
                    aegis of the State Department. Booz-Allen wanted me, and I signed a contingency
                    contract to work for Booz-Allen and to head the international access
                    negotiations part of that, if we won the contract. That never happened because
                    it was too ambitious.</p>
                <p>So when I left the White House staff, I went into the “job search” seminar at the
                    State Department and made a real job out of it. I kept office hours. I went to
                    the offices which, fortunately, were in the old Iranian Embassy [on
                    Massachusetts Avenue] at that time. I lived in American University Park, so it
                    was easy to commute. I went there at about 9:30 AM every morning, got my
                    telephone calls, and worked the job search very assiduously. At the end of this
                    period I came up with the job which I'd sort of had “in the wings” all along.
                    This was offered to me, so I went with Booz-Allen, and Hamilton.</p>
                <p>At the time I knew that I was retiring, I called up Ralph Shrader and said that I
                    was leaving. I said that he and his people had been interested in me. This
                    other, ISDN project wasn't maturing. I asked if there was anything else that
                    they wanted to do with me. He set up an appointment, and I went up and met with
                    him. He was by this time a senior Vice President of Booz-Allen and was
                    accompanied at this meeting by Luke Capone and two other people. Capone was
                    another Booz-Allen guy who moved up to be a senior Vice President of the firm.
                    We talked for about an hour, and I was given an offer to work for them as a
                    consultant on several, specific matters.</p>
                <p>So for the first year at Booz-Allen I worked on a consulting basis. However, I
                    was charging enough, on an hourly basis, that when I began to get into the
                    business building mode, and I was working for them on about a three-fourths time
                    basis, it was costing them more money than to pay me on a full-time basis. I
                    kind of liked this arrangement. I was bringing in a lot of money. However,
                    Booz-Allen then made me a full-time job offer.</p>
