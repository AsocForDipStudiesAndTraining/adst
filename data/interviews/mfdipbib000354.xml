                <p>An interview with Gordon W. Evans</p>
                <p>Interviewed by Barbara S. Evans</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: December 9, 1998</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am Barbara Evans, the spouse of Gordon Evans, who I will
                        be interviewing for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training at
                        their request. My first question is, how did your educational background
                        prepare you for the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Early years and education</p>
                <p>EVANS: My entrance into the Foreign Service was pure serendipity, but I will
                    explain my background. It started out by growing up in western New York State
                    with a father who was an educator and a mother who was also an educator,
                    although she died at 43 years of age. I did my high schooling in Rochester, New
                    York, at Monroe High for those from Rochester, a very fine public school. I went
                    off to Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, in 1950. It had a work-study
                    program that was introduced by Arthur Ernest Morgan in 1920. He had retired to
                    Yellow Springs in his 80s and was a mentor of mine. He had in early 1950 gone to
                    India to visit President Dr. Rajendra Prasad. In fact, he was invited at his
                    request. The Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Commission established the Indian
                    Institutes of Technology and also proposed the Land Grant Agricultural
                    University involvement in India's agriculture. In Yellow Springs, in addition to
                    a liberal arts college of about 1,200 students, there was the Fels Institute of
                    Behavioral Studies. Though I did my degree in mechanical engineering, I was
                    fascinated by the longitudinal studies that were conducted at the Fels Institute
                    on children from conception until 18 years of age. My co-op experiences took to
                    me Tennessee, Alaska, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and California. Another
                    personality in Yellow Springs, since people shape one's philosophy of life, was
                    Charles F. Kettering, inventor of the automobile self-starter and the improved
                    DC battery. He was General Motors Director of Research in its early years. He
                    lived in neighboring Kettering, Ohio, which is really an integral part of
                    Dayton, Ohio. Charles Kettering came to Yellow Springs in my later years, maybe
                    1953-1954. He would sit in the dining services and look us over to see whether
                    or not he would give some of his fortune to Antioch. He ended up dedicating a
                    library to his first wife, Olive Kettering.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Of course, there were the engineering courses, but also courses in a wide range
                    of liberal arts subjects. I was elected to be the community manager my last
                    year. It involved me in a leadership role there. My job was that of liaison
                    between students and the administration. In April 1955, I was awarded a
                    Fulbright Scholarship to study town planning and comparative local government in
                    Norway. I could not marry my interviewer in 1955 in the spring because we were
                    uncertain as to whether a Fulbright Scholar could have a spouse and still be
                    eligible for the scholarship. Barbara's assignment with the American Friends
                    Service Committee (Quakers) just happened to be to a project in suburban Oslo.
                    Here again, serendipity prevailed. I went to the Norwegian-American Summer
                    School in the summer of 1955 to learn basic Norwegian. This was our first real
                    overseas experience together. We were married on September 3, 1955 in Oslo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you perceive that Fulbright year beyond the
                        studies? Did it in any way affect your thinking about possible work
                        abroad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: Maybe subconsciously it did. I did an unpublished piece called
                    “Comparative Local Government and Town Planning in Ten European Countries.” I
                    visited all of the other nine countries, possibly as a justification for travel
                    under the Fulbright. I was fascinated by post war Europe. It was 10 years after
                    World War II and Norway was still under very tight resource allocation control.
                    It was rebuilding from the devastation of the Germans' scorched earth policy.
                    You know that 2/3 of their shipping fleet was sunk. The whole western coast of
                    Norway was damaged badly. Barbara and I had the pleasure (In fact, her mother
                    when she visited introduced us) of meeting Sverre Markussen, who was a large
                    entrepreneur of crushed stone in Oslo. He took me down the coast of Norway and
                    showed me a conveyor belt which had a hand clasp on it. I said, “What is that,
                    Sverre?” and he said, “That was brought to us under the Marshall Plan.” This was
                    my first exposure to foreign assistance. [Perhaps] that had an impact on my
                    later career, maybe subconsciously. I certainly was very moved to see my first
                    hand clasp.</p>
                <p>In June aboard the S.S. Stavangerfjord steaming toward Norway, I was elected
                    president of the Norwegian-American Summer School. This permitted me to get to
                    know the American ambassador from my hometown, L. Corrin Strong. In that summer
                    school, we had a Texan stand up when the Surgeon General of Norway, Karl Evang,
                    was speaking. He said, “How can you place doctors throughout rural Norway at
                    $4,000 a year salary when there is so much more money being earned in Oslo,
                    Bergen, or one of the other large cities?” Evang looked over the top of his
                    glasses and said to this tall Texan, “I do not remember the salary of Jesus
                    Christ.” This I found a very fine response. I've often said this to those who in
                    our economic development work were a little too concerned about the level of
                    their salary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Norway, what was your next step educationally?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>EVANS: As an act of trust and devotion, Barbara left Antioch to marry me without
                    completing her bachelor's degree. So, we were looking at higher education - in
                    my case, post graduate education. We applied to a number of institutions and
                    ended up at the Wharton School, where I obtained a master's of governmental
                    administration and wrote a thesis that's somewhere on the shelves there called
                    “Concepts of Leadership in the Council Manager Movement.” Here again, Arthur
                    Morgan had been a major influence on the need to look at how urban America was
                    evolving. He was well aware that there would be increased family breakdown,
                    increased crime, and a stress level in much of urban America that needed to be
                    attended to and that professional leadership - i.e. city managers - in the
                    cities was important. We had a year in Samuel Fel's home, which was the
                    Institute of Local and State Government of the Wharton School of the University
                    of Pennsylvania. Barbara worked at the University of Pennsylvania's hospital
                    with a very distinguished surgeon to put me through graduate school. So, she
                    postponed her education to advance my career, which was not uncommon in the
                    1950s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went from Philadelphia to have an internship in your
                        field from Wharton. Where was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: We packed our old Ford Fairlane and took off for Vallejo, California.
                    Vallejo is north and east of San Francisco. It's the home of Mare Island, a
                    shipbuilding center, where the atomic bomb was stored before it went out to do
                    its devastation. Vallejo had a population of roughly 50,000 people. I interned
                    there for six months in the fall of 1957 with John Fickland, the city manager, a
                    fascinating man. I worked on many projects supporting the extensive annexation
                    program and redevelopment of the city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did have in mind going into the field of city
                        management for quite a while, did you not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: Yes, I did. We looked at that very carefully when in the spring, we
                    received two proposals almost simultaneously in March or April of 1958. One was
                    from the city of Anchorage, where I was asked to be the assistant city manager.
                    The other was a letter from the International Cooperation Administration, a
                    predecessor to AID, asking me to apply for the Overseas Intern (OI) Program.
                    Antioch College had recommended my candidacy. We chose the Foreign Service. We
                    would have two years and we could look it over. In April, we were delighted to
                    be accepted into this Overseas Intern Program. We were told that the 29 OIs were
                    culled from 16,000 applications.</p>
                <p>Joined ICA in the Overseas Intern Program and assigned to Pakistan -
                    1958-1963</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>We arrived in Washington on July 16, 1958. I was one of three public
                    administration overseas interns along with 26 other interns in this special
                    program. In 1954, Professor Henry Wriston, then at Yale University, did a
                    seminal report on the U.S. Foreign Service. He concluded that the Marshall Plan
                    could have been run by embassies in Europe and in some ways was, although the
                    productivity units were also very vital. This was because there were millions of
                    trained Europeans that were unemployed, yet with excellent training. What they
                    needed were resources. Our work in the late 1950s was to move into former
                    colonies where almost no trained talent was available. There was a need for a
                    professional economic development cadre to carry out this service. Hence, the
                    Overseas Intern Program was born in 1957 and served well into the 1960s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to Pakistan in 1958, you had taken time to
                        study Urdu. As an intern with ICA, what were your responsibilities and how
                        did Urdu help you in your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: I should be responding to this in Urdu, but I do not want to confuse the
                    transcriber. Also, I have lost much of that ability. I think that knowledge of
                    the language is important. In Pakistan, the official language, Urdu, means
                    “language of the camp.” It's 35-40% Arabic. There is a smattering of Hindi and a
                    fair amount of Persian. It was an integrating language for 1,000 years in
                    northern India. It certainly permitted us to travel widely in Pakistan. In fact,
                    for the Mission Director over my five years there, I visited every region of the
                    country. I talked about AID assistance with commissioners of these regions and
                    the deputy commissioners at the district level. I felt they were truly
                    interested in how we were assisting to the tune of nearly $200 million a year.
                    They were appreciative of new unfolding projects that affected their area
                    directly. Whether these presentations had any long-term impact I'm not sure, but
                    certainly my Urdu was helpful both in East and certainly in West Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pakistan is a post-World War II creation, is it not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>EVANS: This is right. This is one of the great dramas of being in a country such
                    as Pakistan. Let me give a little flavor of what we found there when we arrived
                    in September 1958 to join the Public Administration Division. First of all,
                    Pakistan is really called “the Place of Purity” in Urdu. This was created in
                    1947 by the partition of the subcontinent. It was felt by the British, who had
                    controlled this area for almost 300 years that it was the only way to stop the
                    internecine struggle between Hindus and Muslims. The Muslims had invaded the
                    subcontinent in the ninth century. The Mogul Emperor in power in the 19th
                    century lost all of it to the British after his failed great uprising, or as the
                    British said, “Great Mutiny” in the 1860s. Pakistan was to be a regrouping of
                    Islamic society in South Asia free from the communal conflict of the past
                    century. Muslims by and large lost their power in the 1860s. Three weeks after
                    our arrival in September 1958 and 10 weeks after the critical coup in Baghdad,
                    the Pakistani armed forces staged a coup literally in our backyard. We were
                    called by the Chief of MAAG, General Truman, at 2:00 am on October 7th. He asked
                    me to go immediately to the Marine House and wake the Marine security guard.
                    They were ordered to the embassy to provide protection and to destroy classified
                    documents. So, I walked four blocks through the night as tanks were going down
                    the street to wake up our Marines, who could not hear the telephone because of
                    their room air conditioners. This was sort of an extracurricular activity.
                    Hence, an early baptism into our life in the U.S. Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was another aspect of that. You had just completed a
                        rather large project for ICA with respect to counterparts in the Pakistan
                        government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: You're right. From day one, I had responded to both the Chief of the
                    Public Administration Division and the Director of the Mission to do a huge
                    (maybe 8x30 foot) organizational chart of the federal government and two
                    provincial governments of East and West Pakistan with all senior officers and
                    their interface with the over 300 USAID advisors in the country by names, their
                    ties, and how they were backstopped by senior GOP [Government of Pakistan]
                    officials. We had somewhere in the order of 40-50 technical assistance or
                    program assistance projects. After the October 7th coup, the first thing I did
                    the next morning was to put a sheet over that organizational chart. It made me
                    well aware that leadership is very temporal.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your early weeks in Pakistan, particularly following
                        the coup, how did you perceive the assistance that America was giving to
                        Pakistan?</hi>

                <p>EVANS: The USOM [United States Operations Mission], which is the old name for
                    USAID, in the 1950s was assisting that country in a twofold fashion. The first
                    was to assist a country that really had taken over the desert of northwest
                    former India and the riverine region of Bengal, half of which is flooded each
                    spring. So, the land was not of high priority to the Hindus. Hence, when the
                    Muslims fell from grace in the middle of the 19th century, they tended to
                    gravitate into these marginal areas. So, our assistance was in building
                    nonexistent institutions and infrastructure (which was substantial). Secondly,
                    it was to strengthen a fragmented agriculture base and launch newly established
                    industries by our program loans for imports of equipment, supplies and raw
                    materials. Our assistance averaged over $200 million annually, which was
                    justified in part to Congress by Pakistan's astute decision to join the Baghdad
                    Pact in 1954. After the 1958 coup in Iraq, of course, the Baghdad Pact became
                    CENTO, but Pakistan was still a central force. The IMF and World Bank were also
                    substantial contributors to the birth of this nation. The World Bank, in fact,
                    coordinated one of the most miraculous achievements in the post World War II
                    period, in my judgment. It negotiated the division of the six great rivers in
                    the post-partition subcontinent: three going to Pakistan, including the Indus
                    River, and three going to India. More importantly, they assisted, as did we, in
                    very large loans to modernize the irrigation systems from these rivers just as
                    the Green Revolution was unfolding. In a more micro way, the Public
                    Administration Division coordinated roughly 12 projects. I'll only touch on two
                    of them to give a flavor.</p>
                <p>One was the establishment of an Institute of Public and Business Administration
                    in downtown Karachi. From 1956-1960, IPBA was assisted under a contract with the
                    University of Pennsylvania, but this contract was terminated by a displeased
                    USOM Director in 1960. It was replaced by a more wide-ranging contract with the
                    University of Southern California. During my five years in Pakistan, 1958-1963,
                    this project trained thousands of master graduates in public and business
                    administration, but also strongly supported the creation of two National
                    Institutes of Public Administration in both East and West Pakistan. Probably a
                    major reason East Pakistan finally withdrew from the federation in 1971 and
                    became Bangladesh was that there were just too few national institutions located
                    within the Bengali culture of East Pakistan. As an overseas intern, I served
                    primarily as the Program Officer for the Public Administration Division ensuring
                    that both the University of Pennsylvania and USC had adequate funds in the
                    pipeline to continue their faculty advisors, the training of the Pakistani
                    faculty in the U.S., and supplies at their physical facilities of what became
                    important institutions in Karachi, Lahore and Dacca. So, that was illustrative
                    of one project.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Another was the Atoms for Peace Program, which we handled. I touch on this in
                    part because of the recent testing in Pakistan. The Atoms for Peace Program was
                    created by President Eisenhower by a pledge to the General Assembly in the
                    mid-1950s that our knowledge and wisdom in respect to harnessing the atom would
                    be extended to every country of the world, all interested people, peacefully,
                    and to share this nonlethal use widely throughout the world. My work was to
                    coordinate the U.S. assistance to Pakistan's Atomic Energy Commission largely
                    through Ph.D. training of Pakistani scientists in U.S. institutions. Over 200
                    were so trained. The Commission's director, Dr. I.H. Usmani, went on to head the
                    UN's International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna in the late 1960s. In the past
                    two decades, China has clandestinely supported Pakistan's effort to make and
                    test an atomic bomb, but the U.S. Atoms for Peace Program was conceived strictly
                    to use the atom in support of agricultural, industrial, and energy development,
                    and in the health field. President Eisenhower may have been buoyed by the
                    idealism of the 1950s, but he also was aware that extending knowledge on its
                    peaceful use might strengthen our effort to limit its destructive use.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eisenhower gave this program to Pakistan. It was wonderful
                        to be able to have him visit the Mission. Do you want to speak to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: In 1959 on his way to India probably, President Eisenhower visited
                    Karachi. I was on a second story construction platform (I'll never forget the
                    thrill of this) hanging onto a reinforcing bar when down from the airport in a
                    Victoria carriage President Field Marshall Ayub Khan and President Eisenhower
                    were sitting side by side being drawn by 14 beautiful white horses. Two million
                    people were cheering. It was incredible. This was the leader of the free world
                    coming to our first developing country. We had worked on an arrangement whereby
                    the President would travel by helicopter with President Ayub Khan over 500,000
                    homeless people in the rural reaches of Karachi. We pledged then and there that
                    each of them would be housed. We made good on that pledge in the next 10 years.
                    So, the huge satellite city of Karangi sprang up contiguous to Karachi. This was
                    launched at the time of President Eisenhower's visit.</p>
                <p>Let me touch briefly on the overseas interns' luxury when they arrived at
                    Mission. The first six months were set aside for each of the 29 of us throughout
                    the world to visit every division othe USOM. I did this from September 1958 to
                    April 1959 and compiled a large book in typical public administration fashion of
                    how each division functioned, its interaction with the Government of Pakistan,
                    and the divisions' various goals and strategies refined also in respect to
                    USOM's accountability to Washington. Many pictures were included and each draft
                    was approved by the nine USOM Division Chiefs, who wanted copies. Of course, we
                    made copies for them. This happened to catch the eye of the USOM Director, James
                    Sinclair Killen. He asked me in 1960 to be his special assistant. When he asked
                    me, we were going on leave in the fall of 1960. As I was leaving his office, he
                    said, “Gordon, there is one thing that you are to always maintain.” I said,
                    “What is that, Mr. Killen?” He said, “Your sense of humor.”</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>One of the splendid experiences that all of us had in the 1950s-1960s, and I'm
                    sure it's true today, was to associate with men and women of action who direct
                    the economic development program. James Killen is a very good example. A
                    self-made man, he had risen through the ranks of the Paper, Pulp, and Sulfide
                    Workers Union in the Seattle Area. George Meany ensured that labor leadership
                    was hired by the International Cooperation Administration in the 1950s. Killen
                    came in at the top. He was a conceptualizer, was comfortable with George
                    Kennan's containment policy, and really enjoyed policy negotiations with senior
                    Pakistani officials. He enjoyed it because he was very good at it. He was astute
                    at the policy level. He worked closely with the Harvard Advisory Group and, in a
                    way, was the leader of the Western Consortium in Karachi. He had immediate
                    access at all levels of government because of the magnitude of our
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were the special assistant to Jim Killen, what
                        were your major responsibilities in that role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: The first was probably to keep my sense of humor, which I generally did. A
                    special assistant position is one to be envied. You sit in on all the important
                    meetings. You don't really have any bucks that stop at your desk, but you do
                    learn a great deal. The first assignment he wanted me to work on in January 1961
                    was to analyze the overlapping layers of local government in greater Karachi. I
                    proposed a Dade County, Florida, approach whereby the Karachi federal area for
                    planning, tax, and governing purposes would absorb over 20 archaic entities. To
                    get a flavor of this, Karachi in 1935 was roughly 20-40,000 people. Today, it's
                    a city of just about 10 million people. When we were there in 1958-1963, it was
                    somewhere in the order of 3-4 million people who had arrived within just a few
                    short years, from southern India in large measure. Mr. Killen took that report
                    and shrewdly placed it into the hands of the 30-year-old Minister of Commerce,
                    Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who later became President of Pakistan and much to our
                    dismay in 1981 was executed. Minister Bhutto and I had a fascinating evening
                    during 1961 where there was a great deal of discussion of our role in Pakistan's
                    future. He was largely positive, but he was very concerned about our
                    negotiations for military assistance to India. Of course, that is still a raw
                    nerve to this day. But Bhutto had experienced imports and exports languishing
                    for months in Karachi Harbor, in part because of jurisdictional disputing. He
                    also was from the Sindh, which included the federal territory. So, he was the
                    one to look at this report. He was also the one that made many changes that grew
                    out of recommendations in that report, we felt. But in his letter of thanks to
                    Director Killen, he requested that my report be amended to state that “My father
                    laid the groundwork for Pakistan in 1935, by persuading the British Raj to
                    divide the huge Bombay state into the Maharashtra state, largely Hindu, and the
                    Sindhi state, largely Muslim. Then the Sindh state voted to join Pakistan in
                    1947, offering an excellent harbor on the Arabian Sea.” We made the change and
                    sent another copy of the revised report over to Minister Bhutto.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Another assignment which came almost immediately thereafter was to accompany
                    President Kennedy's Science Advisor, Jerome Wiesner, and his seven person team
                    on their water logging and salinity tour of West Pakistan. President Kennedy had
                    promised Pakistan's president Field Marshall Ayub Khan over a Camelot-like
                    dinner at Mount Vernon that he would put his best American brains on this
                    devastating, creeping problem. Wiesner had come down from MIT to be Kennedy's
                    science advisor. There were well over 100,000 acres per year being lost to soil
                    salinity because extensive new irrigation had raised the water table to the
                    surface. This permitted the strong sun rays to evaporate the water leaving salt
                    crystals behind. This water just could not run off because the existing drainage
                    canals were too inadequate to cope. The recommendation of the Wiesner team was
                    to install huge tube wells that would be sunk strategically. This was adopted by
                    Pakistan's aid consortium and over $1 billion of wells were strategically placed
                    by computer simulation throughout Punjab and Sindh. Millions of acres have been
                    saved as a result of this and the Green Revolution is alive and well in what is
                    now Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period, you were to lose the leadership of Jim
                        Killen. How did that affect your role as special assistant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: Rather directly, I would presume. As a special assistant, one is normally
                    tied to a particular personality. But I survived the transition, which was
                    really bringing the Deputy Director of Korea to become Director in Pakistan,
                    whereby Jim Killen became the Director in Korea and made some fundamental
                    changes in the Korean assistance program. This may, in my judgment, have angered
                    the new arrival since he had worked so hard on the Korean assistance program and
                    it became sort of a tit for tat situation. He asked us all to rethink our
                    assistance strategy to Pakistan. He asked me to join a small team that requested
                    each division chief to program first from a position of zero allocation. In
                    other words, if your strategy did not appeal to him or to his team, the project
                    would be terminated. There was a great deal of anger and certainly a great deal
                    of insecurity in these early months. A number of senior USOM officials sought
                    transfer. There are so many variables that one focuses on in reviewing a
                    technical assistance project. It's almost impossible to do it in an office
                    situation. What happened was that most of what became increased resources to
                    Pakistan were focused on modernizing the agriculture sector. It did, in my
                    judgment, underscore the authority of the Mission Director at that point. Also,
                    it's very interesting that David Bell, who became the Administrator of AID, had
                    previously been the chief of the Harvard Advisory Group working with the
                    Planning Commission in Karachi, Pakistan. In 1961, President Kennedy appointed
                    him the Director of OMB. It is a known fact that before he left OMB, the aid
                    assistance package was greatly increased throughout the world, but especially in
                    Pakistan. That gave us additional resources in the early 1960s. So, though
                    Killen had left, the new Director after looking me over for a few months asked
                    me to establish a development research and evaluation group.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>I hired two Pakistani NIPA graduates, one from East Pakistan and one from West to
                    give a little balance to our insights. We created a credenza behind the Mission
                    Director's desk. It was a cardex file complex with at least 14 drawers. This
                    held 5x7 cards and onto the cards was information related to a sector of the
                    Pakistan economy. We used the Harvard Advisory Group format. We kept this very
                    current. This was of great use to Director Heilman. He would spin around and
                    pull out a file. We also had each of the AID projects related to each sector and
                    kept this up to date quite easily with the new assistance that we provided. This
                    tool to be valuable needs to be used. I think in this particular case, John
                    Heilman made great use of this. Today, of course, it would be all
                    computerized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Overall, do you think our program in Pakistan was a
                        successful one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: In 1963 when we left, the United States had been active in the country for
                    about a decade. I would say that in partition, the five provinces that voted to
                    join Pakistan were the most backward provinces of the Indian Empire. Literally,
                    our assistance along with other consortium assistance brought these five
                    provinces to life: that is the Sindh; the Northwest Frontier Province;
                    Baluchistan, Punjab, and East Bengal. The British in the middle of the 19th
                    century had poured millions of pounds into the new irrigation system of the
                    Punjab, so the first province that opted for Pakistan, the Punjab, was further
                    developed, but it also provided a strong base for modernization. Our assistance
                    in agriculture was magnificent. Industrial power and infrastructure development
                    were benefitted mightily by our constant program assistance from 1954 until well
                    into the 1970s.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Maybe the most important measure of all, now that we look at Russia, which is
                    staggering, is how a nation that was born out of dust, born with less than two
                    years preparation really, succeeded. The framework for nationhood that was
                    forged during these two decades, 1947-1967, was created from scratch in an
                    almost miraculous fashion. Granted, Pakistan does not have a truly functioning
                    democracy, but there are elections. Political parties do stand. There have been
                    coup d'�tats. There has been military leadership. Without Western assistance,
                    Pakistan would probably have been extinguished by India in the first two decades
                    of its existence. Thirdly, is the fact that in the early 1950s and 1960s, the
                    George Kennan policy of containment was our global goal. The Baghdad Pact was
                    formed in 1954 and Pakistan was a junior member. Iran was critically important.
                    Iraq had a strategic location. Of course, there was Turkey. But in 1958, Iraq
                    dropped out. More recently, Iran dropped out. Pakistan, even though it is
                    critical of U.S. interests from time to time, has been a stable partner in that
                    arrangement which no longer is necessary, but was very necessary in the 1950s
                    and even well into the 1980s. Lastly, U.S. assistance at the level that it was
                    offered ($200 million a year for many years) permitted Pakistan to build its
                    bridges to the international economy and to the world society. It became an
                    effective member of the United Nations. It joined the World Bank. In fact,
                    Mohammed Sharif, the Minister of Finance when we were there, became a Director
                    of the World Bank. I.H. Usmani became the Director of the International Atomic
                    Energy Commission. Moeen Qureshi became a senior officer in the IMF and Vice
                    President of the World Bank. He became President of Pakistan for a brief
                    transition period in the late 1980s. Also, Pakistan was an active member of the
                    International Monetary Fund. Fortunately, it did not need the IMF often, but it
                    was an active member. And it was a member of the Asian Development Bank. Here
                    was a country that was nonexistent in 1947 and quickly became a force in world
                    affairs during this period. So, I think overall, you could attribute some of
                    this, very modestly so, to the effectiveness of U.S. assistance.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After we left Pakistan, what was your next
                        assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: We left Pakistan in April 1963 just short of five years there, which is a
                    long stretch, but very helpful in terms of continuity. On the water logging and
                    salinity team, there was a man, a former general manager of the Tennessee Valley
                    Authority, named John Blandford. You, Barbara, to this day feel that he was
                    central in having us considered for career training in economics at Harvard and
                    MIT.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>But even before leaving Karachi, may I mention to the researcher interested in
                    raising a family overseas that our daughter, Elizabeth, was born on August 9,
                    1959, in the Seventh Day Adventist Hospital. The fact that her mother was
                    trapped in an elevator just before delivery was a cause for concern, but
                    Elizabeth, who is 39 and is in pharmaceutical marketing, never knew that this
                    had occurred. Our son, David, was born in our next tour at the Seventh Day
                    Adventist Hospital. Both children have interests in international affairs. Our
                    daughter was two years in the Peace Corps in the Kingdom of Tonga. David has
                    recently applied to teach with his spouse at an international school somewhere
                    in the world. He is presently based in Seattle. In fact, the American ambassador
                    in Karachi once commented that the only way he had ever known Barbara was when
                    she was pregnant since in the period of our first 24 months in residency there,
                    she was pregnant 18 of those months.</p>
                <p>Received a foreign affairs fellowship to Harvard and MIT - 1963-1964</p>
                <p>We learned just before departing that I had received a foreign affairs fellowship
                    to study development theory at Harvard and MIT. We would return home and go
                    directly to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Upon arriving and realizing I was going to
                    be in the School of Economics at MIT, Charlie Kindleberger, the great theorist
                    in international trade, took me under his wing and said, “Gordon, you've not
                    been admitted to this school. We turned down a cast of hundreds. But I will
                    admit you if you do well in one micro and one macro economics course at Harvard
                    Summer School. I will review those grades in August when you have finished the
                    courses.” So, that is how we started our study there. I did well enough to go
                    into the program. I studied often until midnight. This was the remaking of an
                    engineer/public administration type into a working economist. At that time in
                    MIT's department, there were such names as Paul Samuelson, Evsey David Domar,
                    Rosenstein- Rodan, Charlie Kindleberger, and many other notables. It was
                    incredible to be present with that brainpower and experience. In economic
                    development training, I think almost all of the institutions around the world
                    were still very idealistic in the early 1960s. They followed Hollis Chenery's
                    economic strategy that if you put a certain amount of investment into an
                    economy, other things being equal (which, of course, they never are), you would
                    have a certain percentage annual growth in the gross national product. But it
                    still is very important for any officer working with an economic development
                    agency to have the concept of how economies do develop, how societies grow, and
                    how individual income is augmented. This year at Cambridge was invaluable. In
                    fact, I would say it was an exceptional opportunity that enriched my next 18
                    years in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Before we leave Cambridge and go onward, may I just mention that though my spouse
                    is interviewing me, she also was an integral part of our career life. As soon as
                    we arrived in Karachi, she began teaching at the Karachi American School, then
                    gave birth to Elizabeth in August of 1959 and David in April of 1961. It is
                    significant that there is a generational involvement in foreign affairs. I think
                    this is important for American society. Barbara also studied Arabic at Brandeis
                    University when we were in Cambridge, presuming that we would be posted again in
                    the Islamic world, and was very vital in backstopping so many things during the
                    16 hour days I spent with my books in study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Following the Cambridge assignment, we had an opportunity
                        to work our way back into the Washington scene, isn't that right,
                        Gordon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Returned to USAID Washington to the Near East/South Asia Bureau - 1964-1965</p>
                <p>EVANS: Yes, indeed it was. I had hoped that I would have fulfilled my return to
                    American society and would be ready for foreign posting, but all overseas
                    interns were brought back to Washington for a tour after their first posting
                    overseas. I was no exception. The only disadvantage perhaps (and it's not that
                    much of a disadvantage) of leaving the Agency for a year of training is to work
                    oneself back into the mainstream of meaningful positions. But the Near
                    East/South Asia Bureau (NESA), at the time of what had become the Agency for
                    International Development put me in the Capital Development and Finance Office.
                    After studying macro and micro economics and development theory, I found this a
                    difficult adjustment, but worked hard to move the loans that CDF was processing
                    for the countries that I backstopped. The Assistant Administrator of NESA was a
                    diplomatic Foreign Service officer, William Macomber, a wonderful human being
                    and very well organized.He ran meetings where there was maximum exchange of
                    knowledge. It was my first exposure to an Assistant Administrator in action and
                    I felt quite fortunate. My CDF portfolio included Greece, Turkey, Iran, Israel,
                    Jordan, and Lebanon, as well as Egypt. There were a number of smaller programs.
                    I learned quickly that Israel's program loans, which were substantial, were
                    literally run out of Israel's Trade Commissioner's office in New York. I
                    received telephone instructions as to when the package should be finalized and
                    sent up there. But it also was a very efficient operation. It had been in
                    existence almost from the beginning of the birth of Israel.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Our assistance to Greece was minimal and was phased down. Our program in Turkey
                    was heavily associated with Turkey's railway, steel, and rural electrification
                    enterprises, that is the CDF portion of our assistance to Turkey. I would touch
                    briefly on my pet project, which I worked on after hours. In fact, it was only
                    on paper. I had found its origins in the files of State. It was a project put
                    forth by the then KLM chairman, Laudermilk, in the Netherlands in the 1920s.
                    This project was to construct two huge penstocks that would siphon water from
                    the Mediterranean Sea and drop it into the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea is 1,286 feet
                    below sea level. Such a difference in elevation would generate significant
                    power, but also over a period of 50 years would increase the surface area of the
                    Dead Sea fourfold and thereby increase significantly the vapotransformation rate
                    in the Middle East. This in turn would rapidly raise the annual precipitation on
                    agricultural lands. It would really be the proverbial return to the green
                    pastures and the Garden of Eden of biblical writing. But in 1964/1965, this
                    project was as dead as in the 1920s. I mention it here only because to me the
                    scope of this project and what it could do to focus a major infrastructure
                    project on the collaboration of nations has a much greater possibility
                    today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since you were so focused on the Middle East, why do you
                        suppose you were sent to Ghana?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Transferred to USAID/Ghana as Program Officer - 1965-1969</p>
                <p>EVANS: Well, not unlike the military, the wisdom of the Agency for International
                    Development was perhaps quite accurate in this case, though I have a few more
                    things to say about the nine months in Washington. All of the interest in Ghana
                    started by a colleague when we were going through the cafeteria line in the
                    Department of State, who said, “Would you be interested in a posting in Ghana?
                    The program officer reports directly to the Mission Director. If you're posted
                    there, you'll probably be terminating the program, but that too will be a good
                    experience.” I did put my name into the hat. This was maybe in January of 1965.
                    About six weeks later, the Africa Bureau and the post in Accra accepted my
                    appointment. From a career point of view, it turned out to be the most favorable
                    decision I made in my 25 years in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>My nine months with NESA CDF involved writing many letters of credit, tedious
                    preparation of loan documents, and review of the satisfaction of many conditions
                    precedent. It seemed to be an effort to introduce New York banking analysis and
                    procedures into the developing world. I personally believe it had limited
                    applicability, especially when applied to state enterprises in Turkey, Egypt,
                    and Iran. So, the appointment to Ghana to go back overseas was very much a
                    breath of fresh air for me and for our family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since you went out alone due to the children coming down
                        with chicken pox just prior to our departure, what did you find in Ghana
                        when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>EVANS: I arrived in early April of 1965. My mandate clearly from all parties on
                    both AID and the Department of State's side was to assist in closing out the AID
                    program in Ghana. The Mission Director, Frank Pinder, a former county extension
                    agent from northwestern Florida, developed a large agricultural program in
                    Liberia before accepting the Accra directorship in 1963. In contrast to the U.S.
                    turning down support for the Aswan Dam on the Nile River in Egypt, the U.S. had
                    reluctantly in the late 1950s and early 1960s put a much smaller amount into the
                    building of the Akosombo Dam on the Volta River, construction starting in the
                    early 1960s. The Prime Minister of Ghana, Lesajafo Kwame Nkrumah, had supported
                    the U.S. approach for this massive project. It would supply power to the largest
                    aluminum smelter in Sub-Saharan Africa. Nkrumah supported it against the advice
                    of his rather famous British advisor, Sir Robert Jackson, spouse of economist
                    Barbara Ward. The approach that Jackson objected to was that the Government of
                    Ghana would finance the construction of the dam and the power generation
                    facility and sell cheap power to private international investment in the newly
                    constructed port of Tema. This was very helpful to international private capital
                    since Kaiser and Reynolds would reap the profit. But Jackson disagreed so
                    fervently with the head of the government, Nkrumah, that he resigned his post
                    and returned to the United Kingdom. Another important situation in 1965,
                    particularly in the spring of 1965, is that there were over 2,000 technical
                    advisors from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and over 250 from the People's
                    Republic of China. In one sense, this was pure Karl Marx in that he wrote: “the
                    way to overthrow the metropole powers of Europe is through communizing the
                    former colonies.” Tragically, Nkrumah felt the Communist Bloc would support his
                    great dream to form a United States of Africa. He had even married an Egyptian
                    woman as a show of pan-Africanism. His vision was global. Around 1960, however,
                    he lost interest in the effective development of Ghana.</p>
                <p>Ghana had received its independence in 1957. It was one of the first sub-Saharan
                    African countries to do so. Nkrumah had been at the helm from the very
                    beginning, a graduate of Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and a very
                    charismatic leader. Since he had little interest in development in Ghana, the
                    vacuum was filled by a huge influx of Soviet technicians and a five year open
                    season on supplier credits, especially from the United Kingdom. In fact, after
                    the February 24, 1966 coup d'etat, it took almost six months to discover all of
                    the supplier credit debts that had been established. This was one of the top
                    priority efforts of the International Monetary Fund advisor upon his arrival in
                    the country. So, this was the milieu into which we moved in April of 1965 with
                    Barbara and our daughter and son arriving in May and almost crashing at the
                    airport because they arrived in the middle of a tropical rainstorm.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were sorting through your new responsibilities, our
                        children were faced with an educational dilemma.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>EVANS: You bet they were. In fact, the person interviewing me, my beloved spouse,
                    agreed to teach at the Ghana International School (GIS) (and she reminds me that
                    the pay was $100 a month) in order to have our children admitted to that school,
                    which was already over its quota of students. The American presence in Accra in
                    the spring of 1965 was very modest, possibly eight Americans at the embassy and
                    four at the USAID Mission, in addition to the direct hire technical assistance
                    and contract staff in various parts of Ghana. The American embassy is an
                    architectural reversal of the beautiful mosque and storage facilities of
                    northwestern Ghana. It is suspended over a pool in a lovely, but very small
                    building. We did have two individuals who went on to extraordinary career
                    accomplishment. One was the political officer, Willard (Bill) De Pree, who
                    became the first American ambassador to Mozambique and the very effective
                    ambassador in Bangladesh. The second and his Deputy was Jack Matlock, who with
                    no appointment in the Soviet world because of restrictions on embassies, was
                    sort of marking time in West Africa. Here is a man, to give a little flavor of
                    the team that we worked with (and it was very intimate because it was so small),
                    who could speak 15 languages, was absolutely fluent in six of these. He went on
                    to not only be President Reagan's principal advisor on the summits with the
                    Soviet Union, but to be nearly four years the ambassador to the Soviet Union. In
                    fact, he was the last American ambassador before the dissolution of the Soviet
                    Union. Prior to that, he was ambassador to Czechoslovakia. He is now George
                    Kennan's successor at Princeton's Institute of Advanced Studies.</p>
                <p>But to get back to the major thrust here, there was the Akosambo Dam project,
                    which was also assisted by Ontario Hydro in terms of the technical assistance on
                    developing the capacity to run the power generation project after completion. We
                    had put close to $20 million into this project in the early 1960s. Then we also
                    offered OPIC support in the form of private investment insurance for Kaiser and
                    Reynolds in their aluminum efforts. Our technical assistance program was focused
                    largely on agricultural training, public health services including family
                    planning (in fact, a very progressive family planning program) and limited
                    support for community development efforts. Little additional assistance was
                    contemplated when I arrived. These six projects would be phased out shortly -
                    that is, within the next two or three years. Because of profligacy of the GOG,
                    fewer resources were available to support the agricultural sector, even our AID
                    projects. We had a presence in 1965, but little influence on developmental
                    policy. Our projects were simple, but not far-reaching. They would not really
                    make a difference in Ghana's developmental future.</p>

                <p>EVANS: The coup d'�tat in the early morning of February 24, 1966 really changed
                    the western relationship with Ghana and especially the relationship of the
                    United States with Ghana. This successful coup d'etat was launched under the
                    leadership of a handful of Ghanaian army officers, most especially Colonel
                    Kotaka and Captain Afrifa. Nkrumah had starved the military budget from about
                    1960 onward and had allocated significant saved resources to his presidential
                    guard. This is not unlike what Saddam Hussein is currently doing in Iraq.
                    Nkrumah was absent from Ghana to assist in ending the Vietnam War, showing his
                    idealism and his global thoughts through negotiations with China and North
                    Vietnam. He had felt that if he could bring about an end to this senseless
                    conflict, in his opinion, he would again win the good graces of the West, most
                    especially the United States. At any rate, in his absence the upcountry army
                    contingent, a small group, slipped through the night, secured first Kumasi,
                    which is the commercial center of the Ashanti people, and then went on through
                    the rainforest to Accra, arriving around three o'clock in the morning. I was
                    Acting Mission Director at the time this coup occurred. I won't describe making
                    the rounds and the machine gun fire and the deaths that occurred other than to
                    say that at about three o'clock in the morning, Barbara was the first one to
                    hear the machine gun rounds, at least in our compound. We had a capital
                    development officer visiting from Washington. It was quite an experience to go
                    through what amounted to our second coup d'etat in our second post. The evening
                    of February 24, Flagstaff House, where Nkrumah lived, was secured around four
                    o'clock in the afternoon. There was a considerable loss of life — probably
                    200-300 people were killed even though officially they only noted that 18 had
                    died. The next evening, responding to a request from the government
                    statistician, E.N. Omaboe, I met with him at his simple little office to explore
                    how the U.S. could respond with assistance quickly and effectively. He became
                    the Minister of Finance and Development in the new government and so was to be a
                    very important power. That evening, in a rather leisurely but somewhat tense
                    session, we shaped a package of at least proposals of PL480 supply for the
                    resource starved processing plants, a $2 million sector loan focused on planning
                    and development of efficient infrastructure, bringing in the International
                    Executive Service Corps (as we called them, the Paunch Corps) for assistance to
                    five of the languishing state enterprises, (Nkrumah had given support to the
                    establishment of over 100 state enterprises that were largely a mess), and a
                    pledge to work closely with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
                    in forming a western consortium for ongoing assistance.</p>
                <p>AID/Washington was supportive of most of this package in just an outstanding
                    fashion. In fact, the new GOG leadership felt properly that the U.S. wanted
                    Ghana to develop and to participate effectively in the international economy,
                    which was certainly not the case in the last four or five years of Nkrumah's
                    leadership. His principal focus was supporting destabilizing efforts in those
                    former colonies that did not want to join his grand plan for the United States
                    of Africa.</p>

                        Williams?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>EVANS: Ambassador Williams arrived in early February of 1966, had been Director
                    of the Africa Bureau of the Peace Corps, was a close friend of Sargeant Shriver,
                    and was certainly known to President Kennedy. He was an African-American of
                    fairly significant militancy. He had come out to work with his brothers and
                    sisters. The first major policy difference that we had (Frank Pinder was still
                    in Washington at the time) was whether or not to include tobacco in the PL480
                    package. The government of Ghana had requested tobacco because they had two
                    cigarette and cigar manufacturing facilities and it was both an import
                    substitution effort and it would save substantial foreign exchange. Williams was
                    aware of the dangers of smoking. He took a strong stand that this tobacco
                    component, which ran into a number of millions of dollars, should be deleted
                    from the package. He directed me to draft a cable to the U.S. Department of
                    Agriculture. I came over and we sat in his office. I pleaded with him to use a
                    more informal channel, that is, the telephone, to inquire about the feasibility
                    of dropping tobacco. He did and, of course, tobacco was kept in the program. I
                    think in some ways by alerting him to the fact that he would get into trouble,
                    we formed a friendship that lasted during his entire stay in Accra. In other
                    words, he was not recalled for consultation, which is generally a prelude to
                    transfer. It does show the nature of the tobacco lobby in the 1960s in
                    Washington and their hold on the U.S. Department of Agriculture to dispose of
                    surplus tobacco widely throughout the world. (Note: Tragically, Franklin H.
                    Williams died of lung cancer in New York City in 1989. Bishop Tutu flew from
                    South Africa to attend his funeral.).</p>
                <p>The multimillion dollar PL480 agreement was negotiated by the late spring of 1966
                    with first shipments arriving in the summer. That whole PL480 mechanism was so
                    impressive, it was prompt, it was substantial, and provided critical raw
                    materials for Ghana, especially cotton for its languishing textile industry.
                    Some of Ghana's textile plants (I think there were five altogether) turned out
                    absolutely beautiful textiles.</p>

                <p>EVANS: The Ford Foundation with its regional headquarters in Lagos provided grant
                    assistance to the government of Ghana. They brought in the Harvard Advisory
                    Group to Ghana. The team's first reaction was why use precious hard currency
                    loan money for this sector development study? They called the ambassador over
                    and had a meeting. Believe it or not, Minister E.N. Omaboe and the GOG were
                    adamant that we proceed with the sector loan that we had in one sense formulated
                    the night of the 25th of February.</p>

                    on his last journey around the world. I arranged a session with Ghana's then
                    president, General Ankrah. We waited in the holding room of the castle until
                    escorted into General Ankrah's large office. Two British suppliers had just had
                    champagne with General Ankrah and he was in light spirits. Our discussion
                    focused on controlling endemic diseases, especially malaria, along the newly
                    formed Volta Lake. General Ankrah most likely preferred his earlier

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the various components of this sector loan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: As it finally was wrapped up in the agreement, it included four sectors.
                    It took from February of 1966, when we first thought of it well into 1967,
                    before this was all ironed out. These four sectors were critical to Ghana's
                    reconstruction. First was agriculture. Here, there was a central focus on a
                    transition out of the inefficient state farms and the enhancement of the private
                    sector with a much greater show of agricultural supplies and research. No
                    pesticides had been imported into Ghana for four years. The marketing of crops
                    was hampered by impassable roads. Many crops just did not get to market.</p>
                <p>The second sector was transportation. Here the strategic plan was to build and
                    maintain feeder roads linked to the productive agriculture hinterland. During
                    the later 1950s and early 1960s, Ghana had some major highways, but the feeder
                    roads were close to nonexistent. This sector study was to focus largely on those
                    critical links to the hinterland.</p>
                <p>The third sector was telecommunications. Here the objective was to develop and
                    take advantage of the fast, modern communication technology which would tie
                    towns and cities to the international network. Many would not believe that
                    almost all international calls from even other parts of Africa would have to
                    either go through London or Paris and then to Accra. This, clearly, Ghana wanted
                    to change.</p>
                <p>The fourth sector was the key water resources sector. This included both the
                    launching of a massive village potable water well program and enhancing water
                    supply for agriculture and industry. Probably 100 state enterprises in the food
                    processing sector involved the construction of factories with limited attention
                    to the agricultural raw materials, or the crops that would be processed through
                    these plants. Three of the four sector loans focused on activating a dependable
                    supply to be delivered to these plants and supplemental markets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All this planning you mention, was it all in Accra or were
                        you able to get it out into the regions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>EVANS: One of the exciting things in 1967 and early 1968 was to work with E.N.
                    Omaboe and The Harvard Group's Jan Coopman and his staff on the decentralizing
                    of planning and project implementation in Ghana. From 1957 onward, even during
                    the British period, all projects were highly centralized. To decentralize, there
                    was a focus on the nine regions and 40 administrative districts of Ghana so that
                    they would originate projects in the planning and collection of data stages.
                    This would encourage sector development at the grassroots level. I had the
                    privilege for almost four months of traveling about Ghana with the Economic
                    Affairs Ministry's senior engineer, Alex Puplampu.We visited the chairmen and
                    secretaries of the newly established Regional Planning Committees. These had
                    been set up in 1967 with an effort to move much of the planning to the regional
                    level. We sought their input also on how the four sector team consultants could
                    link with them through the data collection, strategic planning and project
                    formulation process. We also involved the University of Science and Technology
                    in Kumasi. I believe, UST's staff were hired for subcontract work on at least
                    three of the four sectors.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EVANS: The Mission Director in Lagos, Michael Adler, who had previously been in
                    Liberia, inquired as to whether I might replace Bill Wheeler, who was his
                    Assistant Director for Programs. We knew a civil war was raging in that country,
                    but accepted the offer by extending our second tour in West Africa a third year.
                    In fact, my spouse reminds me that having undergone the coup d'�tat in October
                    1958 in Pakistan, the coup in February of 1966 in Ghana and a countercoup later
                    in 1967, and then to anticipate going into perhaps the most important country of
                    Africa during their civil war, created a reputation. There were those who heard
                    the name “Evans” and wanted no association with them at post because of the
                    nature of the debacles that we had confronted at post.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>To sum up those five years there would be: (1) the Ghanaian people, perhaps more
                    than any other people I've ever lived with, are people of God. They are clearly
                    fueled to enjoy life and our residence there was so enjoyable despite all of the
                    early hardships. (2) I tended to identify with Kwame Nkrumah's exciting dream of
                    a United States of Africa, but clearly Africa had been balkanized so severely in
                    the late 19th century and the metropole powers had such vested interest,
                    including not just France and the United Kingdom, but Belgium and Portugal, that
                    Nkrumah's grand design never had a chance. His efforts to destabilize
                    conservative regimes in West and Southern Africa were linked probably
                    incorrectly to communist infiltration, but by the mid-1960s, little western
                    assistance was going to Ghana. [As I said,] (3) That all changed with the
                    February 24, 1966 coup d'�tat. What that coup did indirectly, although it was
                    probably motivated selfishly by those officers that had been terminated from the
                    Ghanaian armed forces, is that it severed ties with both the Soviets and the PRC
                    very promptly. In fact, all of the Iylushin jets, and I think there were four,
                    were flown back to the Soviet Union filled with Russian technicians that were
                    given 24-48 hours to leave the country.(4) The effort by the western countries
                    was sincerely motivated. It was wide-ranging, and it was based on the need to
                    provide substantial western assistance for a stabilization effort. Also, it was
                    not unknown that Ghana was the first country in the post World War II era that
                    had thrown out a Soviet presence. Suddenly the new leadership of Ghana,
                    especially E.N. Omaboe heading Finance and Economic Affairs, committed itself
                    wholeheartedly to a major stabilization program. It was coordinated in the first
                    three years by the International Monetary Fund and Moeen Qureshi as resident
                    advisor. I even had the privilege of joining AID's Haven North in 1967 in Paris
                    for Ghana's very first consortium meeting. USAID/Accra also worked closely with
                    the World Bank as stabilization took hold and the focus was on getting economic
                    growth underway again in the agricultural and industrial import substitution
                    sectors.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the results of the 1969 elections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: That is sad in one sense because upon our departure in July 1969, that
                    fall, relatively free elections brought Busia to power. He had opposed Nkrumah
                    unsuccessfully in 1957 and had as a result gone into exile. Almost immediately,
                    it was reported, corruption returned. Colonel Acheampong led a coup in 1972 that
                    put him in power for a decade. Again, meaningful representative government was
                    extinguished. In turn, the dynamism and the momentum of the stabilization effort
                    of the mid to late 1960s was largely neutralized. I would add though that today
                    this is not the case. Ghana is beginning to build itself back into a much more
                    prosperous economic position.</p>
                <p>In a coup such as the one staged by Acheampong, those who are the best minds and
                    have the best training and are prepared to put their shoulder to the wheel and
                    really help the economy just leave the country. I do not have hard data on how
                    many left under Acheampong's regime. He was too atypically Ghanaian. He was
                    vituperative, irritable, and petulant. For Ghanaians, it was a 10 year wandering
                    in the wilderness until he was set aside. A brief assignment to USAID/Nigeria as

                    son David, our German Shepherd, Bonita, and the grey parrot, Clyde, joined
                    Barbara and me for the long drive to Lagos, Nigeria from Accra. It took us two
                    days. Barbara was, unbeknownst to her, fighting amoebic dysentery throughout
                    this entire period. Passing through Togo and Dahomey, now Benin, was easy, but
                    in western Nigeria, we had to pass through six military checkpoints. Soldiers
                    often were generally courteous, but there was always the uncertainty of what
                    might transpire. Fortunately for the American space program and for our
                    clearance through these military checkpoints, Neil Armstrong had just landed on
                    the Moon a few days before our passage. Each of these checkpoints had a
                    transistor radio. Our password really was “Neil Armstrong” or “Moon.” It
                    worked.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we find Nigeria when we arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: First of all, the civil war had been going on for three and a half years.
                    It had really torn apart the country, especially the southeast, where over 10
                    million Ibos resided. In 1966, they had created the nation of Biafra and had
                    declared their independence. The U.S. presence was barely tolerated in Nigeria
                    since we led the voluntary agency effort to drop food most nights to the large
                    Ibo population in the east. This was to prevent what would have been massive
                    starvation which was, from the Federal Government of Nigeria's military point of
                    view, exactly what they wanted to happen.</p>
                <p>Mission Director Mike Adler was in fact coordinating two programs. One was an
                    emergency assistance program to minimize the slaughter and death in soon to be
                    former Biafra. The other was the older technical and capital assistance projects
                    that were in disarray in at least the southeast and in other parts of the
                    country during the all-out civil war.In the first six years of U.S. assistance
                    to Nigeria (1960-early 1966), wide-ranged efforts were made to assist the
                    country in rapid development. For example, John Hannah, then president of
                    Michigan State University, committed MSU through AID contract support, to a
                    broad-based effort at the University of Enugu. Hannah and that university's vice
                    chancellor collaborated closely and MSU gave service to UE very high priority.
                    The focus was on building the famous trilogy of crop research, graduate
                    education, and effective extension. This was the center of the Ibo culture,
                    often referred to as the Jews of Africa because of their intelligence and
                    educational prowess.</p>
                <p>Complimentary to institution-building was our capital assistance to upgrading the
                    Calabar Road, an important north-south corridor close to the Cameroon border. A
                    technical institute in booming Port Harcourt was likewise assisted significantly
                    during this early stage of nation-building. But since these three and many other
                    projects were located in what was in 1966 declared the nation of Biafra, Federal
                    Nigeria insisted that we terminate all current assistance immediately. In 1970,
                    these same federal officials were not about to support re-establishment of
                    assistance to the Ibos anytime soon.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>To preserve a semblance of political balance, the British had proposed a divided
                    nation, three states, north, east, and west. Though Nigeria is a very
                    heterogeneous nation, these three areas were heavily Hausa, Ibo, and Yoruba,
                    respectively. Fortunately for stability, the Hausa were the dominant population
                    group and effectively controlled the military, especially after the 1966 coup
                    d'etat. Even the shifting of the capital closer to the north in the 1970s had
                    strategic as well as political overtones.</p>
                <p>Our U.S. assistance to the west and north was likewise crafted in Nigeria's first
                    six years to be institution-building with heavy accent on livestock development
                    in the latter. Since over 40 projects prevailed in agriculture, education,
                    health, community development, industry, and infrastructure, one must credit the
                    energy and commitment of the wave of U.S. teams who established these programs
                    in the early years.</p>
                <p>My responsibilities as Assistant Director for Program were to strengthen our
                    technical assistance program in anticipation of a return to normalcy. Biafra
                    surrendered on January 15, 1970, but the GON attitude toward the U.S. cooled
                    considerably now that they had secured their original boundaries. It was in some
                    ways not unlike Vietnam, where efforts to advance economic development when a
                    war is raging get very secondary or tertiary attention from the host
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the evaluation team that came to Nigeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: AID/W sent out a team from the Agency proper. In fact, the evaluation unit
                    of the Office of the Administrator selected three former Mission Directors to
                    recommend post-civil war strategy in Nigeria. They recommended (and I'll
                    abbreviate this) a program loan as an incentive for a high level policy dialogue
                    with the Government of Nigeria. It would help the GON to launch a major
                    rebuilding effort not unlike the Marshall Plan concept, but of course, much,
                    much smaller. From July of 1969, on our arrival, until early in 1970, I had
                    visited every AID technician in Nigeria, over 80 of them. I probably traveled
                    3,000-4,000 miles around the country. Most had not been visited by AID personnel
                    in Lagos since the coup in January of 1966. [Most of] Our technical assistance
                    efforts were in disarray, further complicated by wave after wave of new oil
                    discoveries. There was a large exodus from rural Nigeria to oil jobs, but also
                    from the senior ranks of the civil service to the booming oil sector. The effort
                    of the evaluation team to have its recommendations accepted and implemented by
                    the then Mission Director were not successful. In the end, USAID Director Adler
                    was quite reluctant to accept the evaluation team's recommendation. I found
                    myself somewhat in the middle on this because I thought their recommendations by
                    and large (and I had worked closely with the team when they were in the country)
                    were right on the mark. I still feel that the U.S. lost an opportunity in
                    Nigeria to engage in a reconstruction effort and a development policy dialogue.
                    Then again, Director Adler knew the ever-present corruption and the antipathy at
                    the end of the civil war toward the U.S. might have proven just too disruptive
                    to a well-coordinated western development consortium. New responsibilities as

                        India?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: We arrived in New Delhi in September 1970 to accept the post of Program
                    Development Officer. This indeed was an eye-opener. India was a very substantial
                    recipient of U.S. assistance. The program was in its third decade of
                    implementation. Since the early 1950s, the U.S. had supported a growing Indian
                    development effort. There were nearly 1,100 U.S. and local employees of the
                    USOM. USOM was used because India did not want to change it to USAID. Over $400
                    million of U.S. assistance flowed to India's 15 states annually. USOM's program
                    office employed over 20 Indian economists, programmers, and implementation
                    officers. They had such a wide experience and competence that the Program
                    DevelopmenOfficer, my role, was largely that of supervision.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Side note: In 1960 upon returning from Kathmandu, Nepal to Karachi, Pakistan
                    through New Delhi, India, I visited the Indian Institute of Public
                    Administration. The Deputy there said, “Why don't you call upon Prime Minister
                    Jawaharlal Nehru? He has open house each morning at his residence before
                    Parliament.” Presuming a cast of thousands the next morning, I was surprised
                    when I found myself alone with him in his rose garden. He said, “Please tell Dr.
                    Morgan that I still keep on my desk always the bust of Lincoln that he brought
                    me in 1950. It gives me confidence when confronting the myriad of secessionist
                    problems throughout our land.”</p>
                <p>Twenty-three years later, I brought the International House's World Council
                    (alumni) for three days of meetings in New Delhi. Our scheduled 15 minute
                    session with Nehru's daughter, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, turned out to last
                    for over an hour, because our first question turned her on. We asked, “What was
                    Macaulay's impact in the 19th century on Indian education?” In summary, she
                    said, “My dear friends, it was devastating! He led us away from our values and
                    traditions. He was obsessed with industrialization, with wealth, with material
                    progress. He was the arrogant justifier of the British Empire.” Indira Gandhi
                    was assassinated tragically by two of her Sikh guards one year later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your Mission Director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: We had Leonard Saccio, a fascinating Italian-American who had for a period
                    of time been the former Acting Administrator of AID in Washington. He was the
                    Director when we arrived and he was replaced by Korea's USAID Director, Howard
                    Houston in 1971. Director Saccio used a very interesting proven technique before
                    he signed any agreement, implementation order, or even official letter. He would
                    call me in and with the document before him fire off three or four questions as
                    to how the project was faring and how this new agreement would assist its
                    development further. If all the answers were solid, he would sign it. If there
                    was any uncertainty in my response, we would go back to the drawing board.
                    Princeton's professor of economic development, John Lewis, personally had shaped
                    U.S. assistance during his USOM directorship in the 1960s. India had been an
                    effective member of the World Bank's consortium of donors since the late 1950s.
                    USOM's policy dialogue with the GOI was focused on liberalization of import
                    controls and foreign private investment. Most other donors (and there were
                    literally, if you include the not-for-profits, hundreds) were in full support of
                    this framework. GOI took steps toward liberalization. I'm convinced it never
                    would have on its own. Senior Indian officials always did their homework.
                    Negotiating sessions with them were formal and constructive, whether involving
                    PL480, program lending, capital projects, or technical assistance. Since there
                    were over 100 programs and projects in the early 1970s, I'll just touch on
                    three.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What three projects have you chosen?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>EVANS: It was hard. There are at least 15 that were my favorites, but we're going
                    to look at the agriculture universities, family planning, and U.S. owned local
                    currency support for low cost housing throughout India. On the agriculture
                    university front, as noted earlier, the American Arthur Ernest Morgan, who was
                    the first Chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority and a friend, had joined
                    Dr. Radhakrishnan's (later President of India) Higher Education Task Force in
                    1950. Morgan was the only American on the task force. A central recommendation
                    of this task force was the establishment of outstanding agricultural and
                    engineering universities in each of what became India's 15 states. Over 20 years
                    later, when we arrived in New Delhi, it was exciting to work on the advancement
                    of this program, implemented by nearly 10 U.S. Land Grant Universities ranging
                    from Kansas State University to the University of Tennessee. The majority of
                    Indian faculty were trained in the States at one of these sister institutions.
                    They returned with real insight into the power and resilience of American
                    agriculture. Hence these Indian agriculture universities were very receptive to
                    the Green Revolution sweeping the world in the latter part of the 1960s and
                    certainly in the 1970s. The Revolution was based on solid crop research, the
                    optimum use of irrigation water, and the maximization of the growing cycle.
                    India tied in effectively with these western consortium supported research
                    stations. I would mention especially ICRISAT, which concerned itself with
                    semiarid agriculture research near Hyderabad, India, and IRRI, powerfully
                    focused on rice, in Los Banyos, Philippines. We also supported hundreds of U.S.
                    owned local currency research projects at each of these U.S. assisted
                    agriculture universities. India, known as an empty rice bowl early in the 20th
                    century, has only had to import grains once in the past 30 years to the best of
                    my knowledge.</p>
                <p>On the family planning front, John Cool and Alvin Roseman were two forceful
                    leaders in support of a dynamic Indian population program. Perhaps less
                    sensitive then than now, foreign assistance in support of population growth
                    limitation had to be administered carefully. Urban India is as sophisticated as
                    most societies on Earth, but how to reach the then 600 million rural Indians?
                    Both program lending and U.S. local currency grants made contraception widely
                    available. The policy was to never have a shortage of contraceptives - at least
                    condoms. A more ambitious and hence controversial program was Indian's Health
                    Ministry's support of the 333 clubs throughout the land. Though voluntary,
                    fertile Indian couples were encouraged to limit their families to three
                    children. If that number was exceeded, the men were encouraged to have a
                    vasectomy when they reached 33 years of age. If one examines the policy and
                    supply structure of our four decades of family planning assistance, it has been
                    [recently] said that 15 million less Indians will have been born by the year
                    2000.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The third project is the low cost housing program. It used the millions of
                    dollars of U.S. owned local currency. The researcher in the next century may not
                    realize how we came by so much local currency, but in the period of the 1960s
                    and 1970s, even the late 1950s, there was a plan for India to purchase our
                    imports with local currency. We owned the local currency and we had limitations
                    on how much of it we could sell or revert to the U.S. Treasury. So, we had
                    literally millions of dollars of local currency in New Delhi in support of our
                    development effort. This low cost housing program is just one example. The
                    Delhi-based coordinator came out of the Bombay banking community. He was a
                    dynamo. By streamlining the grant procedure, he was able to approve thousands of
                    applications within three days of receipt at low or no interest. Each day he
                    notified his approval to a cluster of pre-approved banks so that implementation
                    could begin at once. Hundreds of thousands of simple homes were constructed
                    while creating a repayment fund for the Indian Housing Authority for relending
                    in future decades. The typical Indian bureaucrat could learn a lot from this
                    man. He had worked closely with the Tatas in the Tata steel industry in addition
                    to his banking experience and was one of the most charismatic and galvanizing
                    individuals that I've met in my AID career.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EVANS: At last, our honeymoon of assistance to India was over in early December
                    1971 when the GOI military actively supported the creation of an independent
                    Bangladesh in what was up until then the former East Pakistan. The Secretary of
                    State, Henry Kissinger, who I was later to work for, when he left State,
                    announced at a news conference that the U.S. would tilt toward Pakistan. This
                    was not well-received in New Delhi. The U.S. government terminated all PL480 and
                    commodity import programs overnight. A tribute to the GOI's maturity, however,
                    was not to ask all Americans to leave the country at once. Instead, they
                    methodically phased out one or two technical assistance projects each month over
                    a period of two years. I often said that destiny made me one of the most
                    deprogramming officers in the AID ranks.But the Evans family thoroughly enjoyed
                    our nearly three years in India. Ambassador Kenneth B. Keating was from my
                    hometown of Rochester, New York. He was very kind to us, as was his DCM, Galen
                    Stone. USOM Director Howard Houston was a non-career political appointee with
                    compassion, commitment, and quiet intelligence.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your general feeling about assistance to
                        India?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>EVANS: In India, we had seen U.S. assistance received graciously. It was utilized
                    effectively in massive programs and projects. The growth rate in India never has
                    equaled that of the People's Republic of China, but it has been based on a
                    relatively democratic experiment and has been people- oriented and consistent
                    over the decades. We were there at the ending of an era with unilateral
                    termination of our assistance. On my last three week tour through India of AID
                    projects, Indian project directors were truly sad that U.S. assistance was
                    ending. Although they too felt that perhaps they could run these institutions,
                    programs and projects on their own. They expressed time and time again their
                    appreciation for our constant support in the early decades after independence.
                    We left India with a very solid feeling of what U.S. resources had done over a
                    period of nearly 25 years.</p>
                <p>In January 1973, I accepted the chiefship of AID's liaison with the United
                    Nations in AID/W's PPC.</p>
                <p>New assignment in USAID/Washington as liaison with the United Nation-
                    1973-1976</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you find in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: We arrived in Washington in mid-January 1973. I was involved immediately
                    in a TDY assignment to our USUN Mission in New York, where the Governing Council
                    of the UN Development Program was in session. One of the first experiences was
                    with Israel's country program. Normally a nation's five year country program is
                    approved at the formal Governing Council's session in less than an hour. In
                    respect to the debate on Israel's country program, it took three days. But it
                    also offers insight into the UN. One remembers that the UN voted and approved
                    the establishment of the State of Israel in 1949. The 1967 war and the
                    occupation of the West Bank and the Sinai had only intensified regional anger.
                    Letting off steam in this way was far better than having no arena to vent one's
                    frustration and sense of hopelessness. At this session, what the Middle Eastern
                    countries had done, and some countries of Europe, was to examine each of the
                    projects in the Israel country program as to whether or not they advanced peace
                    in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>Over my three and a half years as chief of the UN Relations in AID/PPC, I came to
                    respect what one could call almost the magnificent framework of the UN and to
                    wince at the occasional pettiness of UN officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why are you so positive about the United Nations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>EVANS: Answering it indirectly, central to the UN ineffectiveness is the fact
                    that all sovereignty rests with member states. Impasses in the Security Council
                    or the General Assembly come from policy conflicts among its members, not from
                    the lack of ability of UN officialdom. So, I would say that as countries become
                    more collaborative and more open in their working relationships within these UN
                    bodies, the UN will in turn become more effective as a global institution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was this liaison with the UN carried out in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: We had a series of meetings. I had my weekly Policy Planning Coordination
                    meeting with all of the heads in PPC. I also met with State's Bureau of
                    International Organizations on a weekly basis. Because the U.S. participated in
                    almost all UN agency meetings, our collective role involving eight or 10 U.S.
                    officials in AID and State was to ensure that our mandatory and voluntary
                    contributions were well-planned, effectively spent, and audited against
                    wastefulness. After the UNDP Governing Council meeting in Manila in January of
                    1974, I had the privilege of traveling through Asia, Africa, Europe, and the
                    Caribbean. I visited the Regional Economic Commissions in Bangkok, Addis Ababa,
                    and a number of specialized agencies including the UN Environment Program in
                    Nairobi and the FAO in Rome, as well as select UNDP programs in five countries,
                    including Haiti. The meager resources allocated for the UN development system
                    are golden when compared with the hundreds of billions of dollars spent then and
                    now for military hardware, often in support of repressive military regimes. This
                    is not to argue that there are not inefficiencies within the UN. It is to argue
                    that in terms of resource allocation, the very meager monies that support the UN
                    development system glean for the world and for most member countries far more
                    than any other allocation those resources could bring about. This in no way
                    belittles the U.S. security shield indispensable in achieving 50 years of
                    relative peace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a member of various U.S. delegations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>EVANS: I probably participated in at least 30 U.S. delegations up through July
                    1976, including the sixth and seventh special sessions of the UN General
                    Assembly. Let's focus on that just for a moment. After the 1973 war with Israel,
                    most Arab oil producing countries did not ship oil to the U.S. for many months.
                    This fact frightened European countries. They were very, very much at the beck
                    and call of Middle East leadership. Iran and Algeria, among other oil producing
                    nations, were successful in calling for a special session of the General
                    Assembly. This was the Sixth Special Session. It was to focus on the lack of
                    development progress in most former colonies and to indict the western world for
                    not doing more to ease the debt burden. This Sixth Special Session also elicited
                    pledges of one percent of the gross national product from the industrialized
                    countries for transfer to the developing world. The U.S. position (and we were
                    caught off guard a bit by the rapid development of this Sixth Special Session
                    and our special support for Israel) was to contain this movement by practicing
                    damage control in each of the working groups leading up to the actual Sixth
                    Session in 1974.</p>
                <p>But the Seventh Special Session, also on development, in early 1976 was a
                    different story. Daniel Patrick Moynihan was our ambassador at USUN. He was
                    personally involved in shaping our position, which basically set forth fully our
                    wide-ranging, constant support through the IMF, World Bank, regional development
                    banks, the remaining UN specialized agencies, and our substantial bilateral
                    programs. The U.S. welcomed each and every new nation into the world society and
                    international economy. The private trade sector was powerful and the U.S. would
                    redouble her efforts to lower tariffs and enhance market access. Secretary
                    Kissinger was to have delivered this address, but he was detained in the Middle
                    East at the last moment. Ambassador Moynihan delivered Kissinger's address, much
                    of which he had written from our earlier drafts. He took two hours in addressing
                    the Seventh Special Session in the august General Assembly and consumed five
                    glasses of water. I know this for a fact because I saw that his pitcher was
                    full.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the AID Administrator ever involved in your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: We had a very exciting thing happen in June of 1975. I had arranged for
                    AID Administrator Daniel Parker to address the UNDP Governing Council in Geneva.
                    My arrangement was not so significant as the fact that he accepted this
                    invitation. His theme was the power of trained people and the world we could
                    build together if we used our minds and our hearts. It was a refreshing address.
                    It was unique because most of the heads of delegations would speak about level
                    of support or the percentage of giving or how many projects their country had
                    contributed to over the course of time. This was dealing with the world's people
                    in a way that was both unique and challenging. Most of this address he had
                    written himself. In fact, he had taken an earlier draft that I had done and
                    pretty much ripped it to shreds. It was one of the most moving presentations
                    that I had ever heard in a UN chamber. He also supported my interest in
                    attending the 19th session of the Senior Seminar on Foreign Policy that was to
                    begin in August of 1976.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EVANS: I tend to subscribe to Dean Rusk's statement, which probably was copied
                    from an earlier spokesperson: “If the UN did not exist in the post World War II
                    period, we would have had to invent it.” I tend to feel that the majority of
                    American people are ignorant of the fine tuning of the UN. Its image in this
                    country is one of gross bureaucracy and lack of productivity, which is clearly
                    not the case. On the other hand, the Fifth Committee, which is concerned with
                    budgets and with expenditures always needs to do its homework because we are a
                    very substantial contributor to the UN. Even in 1973-1976, we were in arrears in
                    some of our contributions. Of course, today, 1998, we are over $1 billion in
                    arrears. This is despicable. It is not a position a great nation should find
                    itself in. It's in our own selfish interest that the UN succeed. So, I left my
                    three and a half years working with the UN, visiting most of the specialized
                    agencies throughout the world, with a very positive feeling of the potential of
                    this organization.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EVANS: In April of 1976, I was selected as one of two Agency participants in this
                    19th session from August 1976 to late June of 1977. Our 26 members included at
                    least eight agencies of the United States government, heavily State, but
                    Agriculture, Treasury, AID, USIS, USIA, the CIA, and four of the branches of the
                    military service. A fascinating cluster. We traveled for six weeks throughout
                    North America from Mexico City to Toronto. We had sessions with at least five
                    governors and a two-hour session with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger right
                    after the defeat of President Gerald Ford in November of 1976.</p>
                <p>The central mission of this seminar had been for its 18 preceding years and
                    continues to be today to examine many aspects of American society and its
                    neighbors so that our country's interests can be represented more vividly and
                    persuasively abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this case, was there a research paper involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>EVANS: I published a research paper which was, of course, the requirement of all
                    of my 25 colleagues. Mine was entitled “The Urban Crisis, a National Dilemma in
                    the Nation's Capital.” The paper and my six weeks' work on it focused on the
                    incongruity of the District of Columbia governance and the need for a
                    metropolitan approach. The District not only lost 30% of its 100 square mile
                    original area when Virginia slipped away during the Civil War, but a
                    constructive governing pattern needs to go far beyond the original territory. My
                    paper touched on the enhancement of every aspect of local services from
                    education to water supply, transport to health services, if the District plus
                    three county governance (Montgomery, Prince Georges, and Arlington) could be
                    forged. It was a highly idealistic approach. There is a metropolitan entity that
                    is concerned with very limited powers such as air pollution and long term
                    planning. But we have experienced in the last decade a relative breakdown in the
                    quality of governance within the District of Columbia.</p>
                <p>The 10 month seminar is an exceptional opportunity for a career officer. I would
                    recommend it without hesitation to any candidate. The only downside is that you
                    are outside of the working career ladder and you must literally fight your way
                    back in after the year is over. Insights gleaned through this lively tutoring
                    have benefitted me long after leaving the Service.</p>
                <p>Assignment as Deputy Director Sahel Development Office, Africa Bureau-
                    1977-1978</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What followed the seminar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: The new Assistant Administrator for Africa, Golar Butcher, and her Deputy,
                    Haven North, took me in from the cold. They agreed to my appointment as Deputy
                    Director of the Sahel office in July of 1977. Its Director, David Shear, was a
                    principal architect of an assistance approach to the devastation caused by the
                    advancing of the Sahara throughout former French West Africa. Also by the
                    tendency for these former lands to become less and less collaborative and more
                    pugilistic in disputes over water, migrating livestock, and migrations of
                    people, among other concerns. These six countries (Mauritania, Senegal, Mali,
                    Niger, Burkina Faso (Upper Volta), and Chad) extended over an area nearly the
                    length of the United States. The U.S. limited assistance within this region
                    under this plan would be offered largely on a regional basis to benefit from
                    economies of scale and to enhance greater collaboration. The Sahel is a fragile
                    environment experiencing significant overpopulation of livestock in the northern
                    tier and requiring a measured approach to agriculture production and
                    marketing.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Complicating our direct assistance was the need to be nearly fluent in French.
                    There were perhaps 200 Americans working within the program both in a Sahel
                    regional sense and in bilateral efforts in these six countries and few of them
                    were truly fluent in the French language. The Sahel approach was brilliant in
                    concept, especially when you consider the alternatives. Yet American planners
                    and technicians were required to work within a French institutional framework
                    still dominated by French technicians. The Sahel program never seemed to be
                    embraced fully by the French presence.</p>

                        that was all about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: REDSO is a product of the late 1960s. It refers to the Regional Economic
                    Development Services Office. There was one based in Nairobi for East Africa and
                    one based in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, for West Africa. My appointment as Director
                    of REDSO/West occurred in August of 1978. Here again, the team of Butcher and
                    North believed in my ability to run such a program and I was always appreciative
                    of that.</p>
                <p>I directed REDSO from September 1978-September 1982. The 85 staff included
                    agronomists, economists, capital development officers, civil and water resource
                    engineers, lawyers, contract officers, health planners, nutritionists, and a
                    variety of other specialists. Its principal function was to develop projects
                    within bilateral and regional programs and occasionally to evaluate existing
                    projects. The REDSO Director's authority was subordinate to that of each
                    bilateral Director, but REDSO teams of two to five specialists would arrive in
                    the requesting county after data collection and the rough project paper outline
                    was reviewed by the Director and his or her staff. They would generally return
                    to Abidjan to complete a series of such papers. Often, one of my staff would be
                    working on three or four projects simultaneously advancing them each week. These
                    roving teams were a bit like Johnny Appleseeds, spreading ideas and approaches
                    from country to country. They kept USAID directors current on what was going on
                    in neighboring countries and in the region in general. That idea alone was very
                    valuable. The 24 countries within the REDSO/West bailiwick constituted an area
                    larger than the Continental United States. During my four year assignment, I
                    visited 23 of these 24 countries.</p>

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>EVANS: I believe I did and, to a certain extent, they were controversial. But I
                    still feel they were right. My first goal upon arriving in Abidjan was to
                    attempt to have REDSO/West get a better feel for the dynamics of this vast
                    region. The UK, France, Belgium, Portugal, and Spain had controlled the destiny
                    of these 200 million people until just two decades earlier. Balkanized and
                    non-communicating, the region would clearly benefit from institutions of
                    collaboration and sharing. The Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa
                    provided helpful planning data, but was really too remote. Our work with the
                    Entente Fund in the four countries bounding Ghana was too restrictive.
                    Therefore, much of our effort was focused on strengthening ECOWAS, the Economic
                    Commission of West African States, based in Lagos, but directed by a brilliant,
                    dynamic Ivorian. Though ECOWAS did not include the Cameroons, Gabon, Equatorial
                    Guinea, and Zaire within our region, it did cover a substantial part of the
                    REDSO region. We furnished them every AID project description within their
                    countries and supported strongly their movement toward a West African common
                    market facilitated by an infrastructure geared to that region. This was in
                    contrast to what was left behind by the metropole powers. The ECOWAS framework
                    is solid, but evolving the political will to allocate national resources for the
                    good of the region will take perseverance and constancy. ECOWAS does have a
                    legitimacy and a focus that Kwame Nkrumah's grand design for a United States of
                    Africa never had. There is a reason to hope that future AID regional projects in
                    West Africa could and should be planned and implemented through entities such as
                    ECOWAS.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the African Development Bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: A second major focus was in strengthening the staff of the African
                    Development Bank based in Abidjan. This institution was one of three regional
                    development banks that the U.S. supported throughout the world, including one in
                    Asia and in Latin America. Our principal effort was in improving the quality of
                    project design, implementation, and evaluation, especially in the productive and
                    infrastructure sectors. The ADB hired bright, aspiring officers from all over
                    Africa. Its missions, not unlike those of the World Bank, supported competent
                    professionals in many of the 51 countries of Africa.</p>
                <p>The African Development Bank was not unlike our REDSO in concept. Much of its
                    good work was done through contract sector teams. They ranged widely throughout
                    Africa building field experience and often focusing on, if not breaking, major
                    logjams in a specific sector. Our AID advisors worked with the resident staff in
                    ADB/Abidjan. They assisted in advancing a career service with improved position
                    descriptions, annual evaluations, and more formal peer-competitive promotion.
                    They assisted in sharpening project contracting so that field project
                    implementation could be reimbursed more accurately and measurable progress
                    accomplished. They assisted in computerizing project record keeping including
                    repayment schedules for recipient countries. They also arranged training in the
                    U.S. for key ADB staff and worked closely with other advisors to ADB from the
                    World Bank and other countries. Our AID assistance was minimal, but in its
                    steadfast manner important.</p>

                <p>The U.S. Department of Treasury maintained principal liaison to the African
                    Development Fund for the lesser developing countries of Africa and kept their
                    resident director informed of our assistance. The three regional development
                    banks were an important supplement to the World Bank, UNDP, and bilateral
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are population dynamics important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: The continent of Africa is underpopulated relative to South Asia, but in
                    the 21st century, overpopulation in Sub-Sahara Africa is likely to be one of its
                    greatest constraints to development and quality of life. Ghana was a leader in
                    having a broad based population policy as early as 1970. The informal migration
                    involved probably 20 million people over my 10 years in Africa. This migration
                    was dynamic in the sense that movements were largely from the interior to the
                    coast, but also from one country to another along the coast. The vast bulk of
                    these 20 million people were coming to the coastal countries for employment.
                    Families who joined the wage earner often were not acknowledged by the host
                    government and so schooling, health services, housing, and other benefits to the
                    resident population were generally not available. Population growth still
                    averaged an estimated two percent annually in West Africa. Dakar, Abidjan,
                    Lagos, Douala, and Libreville, among others, were examples of urban breakdown
                    due to uncontrolled migration. The Population Council, the work of the World
                    Bank, and to a certain extent the African Development Bank, would support
                    population programs, particularly knowledge of ways in which to bring the two to
                    three percent annual growth down. But by and large there was little support from
                    AID/Washington after Golar Butcher left office.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget the new Assistant Administrator for Africa sitting in our
                    REDSO/West briefing room. I tried to set the stage for REDSO's work within the
                    region and touched on some thoughts about a regional population strategy that we
                    were working on with the Bank and with ECOWAS. His eyes literally glazed over. I
                    presumed he felt that this should be none of our concern. He may have
                    represented the mentality that has devastated the population programs in
                    countries receiving AID assistance and in shackling the UN Fund for Population
                    Activities. Fortunately, countries such as Scandinavia, Canada, the UK, and
                    Germany are much more supportive and the UN continues to do extremely important
                    work in the field of population dynamics and control.</p>

                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>EVANS: Of course, it is easier to provide assistance to a subcontinent under one
                    central government such as India, but I found the REDSO assignment in West
                    Africa challenging and intriguing. In our small way, the U.S. was patiently
                    assisting through modest projects to undergird a movement toward national and
                    regional participation in the world economy. A generation ago, this was far from
                    the mind of the controlling metropole powers. The REDSO staff were true
                    professionals who knew the region and worked long weeks, often far from Abidjan.
                    We initiated, reshaped, or evaluated over 50 bilateral and regional projects
                    during my tenure in Abidjan. An over-simplified conclusion is that well managed
                    regional projects represent solid developmental assistance if the participation
                    of host governments are strongly supportive. The nature of nationalism tends to
                    assure great host government support for bilateral projects. In respect to Cote
                    d'Ivoire, AID assistance has always been minimal because of its high per capita
                    income and significant French resistance to our presence. Our limited assistance
                    was in the agricultural sector through the Entente Fund. The Entente Fund was
                    directed by Paul Kaya, said to be Houphouet Boigny's son, and focused very
                    limited U.S. resources on Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Togo. Though
                    C�te d'Ivoire and Ghana had nearly identical per capita incomes in 1960, by 1980
                    Cote d'Ivoire's was nearly four times that of Ghana!</p>
                <p>But Barbara and I had agreed that I would retire at 50 years of age. This was not
                    because of disappointment with our career, but because of a feeling that a
                    post-REDSO directorship would be anticlimactic. Therefore, we initiated the
                    retirement action in the spring of 1982 and departed Abidjan in October of
                    1982.</p>
                <p>Concluding observations on foreign assistance and USAID</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you have to say about the 25 year career with
                        AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: I had the good fortune to have 10 specific assignments including two years
                    in long-term training. The training at Harvard and MIT and the Senior Seminar 14
                    years later had a tremendous impact on my perspective on development. The
                    insights extended far beyond my career in the Foreign Service. It's always
                    controversial as to whether taxpayer's money should be used for career
                    development, but I, having so benefitted, am a great supporter for at least one
                    year of such training. I had the creme de la creme experience of two. But both
                    were quite different.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>The other AID postings were in Pakistan for five years, in NESA/CDF for a year,
                    Ghana for five years, Nigeria for one year, India for three years, UN relations
                    for three and a half years, the Sahel office for one year, and Cote d'Ivoire
                    (REDSO/WA) for four years. Out of those experiences, I truly believe the
                    Marshall Plan to Europe and the 40 years of bilateral and multilateral
                    assistance undergirded a period of relative world peace. Could former colonies
                    feel truly welcomed into the arena of multilateral trade and financial flows
                    without such an openness on behalf of the western world? I doubt it. Many
                    countries lacked the discipline to optimize resources for development, but many
                    did have this discipline. The U.S.' solid support for the UN, IMF, World Bank,
                    and regional development banks put in place a powerful institutional framework
                    for the former colonies in Africa and Asia and to a lesser extent in Latin
                    America. We seem now to be in a third phase of maximum utilization of
                    multilateral institutions and eclectic programming of limited bilateral
                    assistance, especially in areas controlled by the former Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>I doubt that our aid will assure democracy takes root in any struggling
                    developing country, but there is no harm in stressing the importance of
                    involving all the people in the electoral and developmental process. I'll never
                    forget traveling deep into the forests of the Ashanti region in Ghana two years
                    after John F. Kennedy had been assassinated and calling upon a lesser chief in
                    the smokey interior of his adobe village palace of sorts. I talked through his
                    linguist to him and the first thing he did was to stand up with all of the 15 or
                    20 villagers in this room and said, “We shall have two minutes of silence in the
                    memory of American President John F. Kennedy.” So, the point here is the
                    humanistic impact of American assistance in the developing world is our greatest
                    gift in the 40 years since the end of World War II. The U.S. was persistent in
                    shaping a very relevant institutional framework and in ushering former colonies
                    into the international economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think about AID's role in general?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>EVANS: I've been away from AID for 16 years and so am not fully cognizant of the
                    major operational issues, but the power of the Economic Development Service to
                    me was its ability to track productive Americans in both the career service and
                    as contractors and consultants and to send them all over the world, often under
                    the most difficult of circumstances. A substantial portion of the billions of
                    dollars transferred abroad, of course, came back to American farmers, factories,
                    and universities. Presumably international trade and greater access to the
                    markets of the developing world will replace much bilateral assistance. But in
                    the 1950s and 1960s, these former colonies either knew little of the U.S. market
                    and certainly were not encouraged by their former colonial masters to know more.
                    The U.S. bilateral aid flow is too low today because the communist threat has
                    been removed. Our arrears in payments to the UN and the IMF may have a greater
                    impact on the world economy than lower bilateral flows, but I feel strongly that
                    the U.S. should remain deeply engaged in the developing world. In addition, the
                    U.S. should use international trade and investment, as we now are doing, as the
                    creative new tools and also shape disaster relief to be ever more efficient,
                    immediate, and provided by the latest technology.</p>
                <p>Closer to my own career experience, I am convinced that western assistance to
                    South Asia avoided a major continuing conflagration between India and Pakistan.
                    Their transition from British rule went smoothly overall. The predicted large
                    scale starvation never occurred and dynamic economies were forged, anchored in
                    increasingly efficient agriculture. My feeling about the successes of West
                    Africa are more ambivalent. This is in part because of Nigeria's abhorrent
                    performance and the sad 19th century balkanization of this massive region by the
                    former metropoles. Where South Asia knew that its land was fragile and
                    vulnerable, traditional patterns of life predominate in much of West Africa.
                    There are pockets of hope where Africa's rich natural resources are exploited so
                    that the majority of these resources flow into development. The Cameroons and
                    Cote d'Ivoire are two good examples of agricultural resources and oil
                    benefitting their economies under enlightened leadership. Both countries also
                    have held to agricultural development as their first priority. On the other
                    hand, Nigeria, Chad, Liberia, and Sierra Leone represent examples of fairly
                    chaotic nationbuilding, where development was by no means the all-consuming
                    priority. But I feel many other of West Africa's 24 countries would have
                    succumbed to this pattern if western assistance, especially technical
                    assistance, had not flowed to them right from independence.</p>
                <p>Some basic guidelines for those interested in successful development would
                    include these: (1) support for improvement in the quality of life of all of its
                    people must come from the top year after year; (2) individual initiative should
                    be rewarded through incentive prices, salaries, and wages; (3) governments
                    benefit by effective relations with the World Bank, IMF, UN, regional
                    development banks, and their neighbors; (4) responsible political freedom is a
                    great catalyst for development even though its supporting institutions and the
                    process may seem chaotic at times; and (5) for the future, private financial
                    flows and international trade will dominate national health more than ever
                    before.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>The Agency for International Development was an extraordinary success if its
                    principal goal was to keep the emerging world free of communism. The rationale
                    for bilateral and foreign assistance in the 21st century will test the genius of
                    our successors. Perhaps a focus on support for private or not-for-profit
                    philanthropy along with efficient disaster relief and emergency assistance will
                    predominate. The U.S. did assist in building a global economy interlaced with
                    effective multilateral institutions. Bilateral flows may now be less vital to
                    the developing countries than continuous, efficient access to the large, wealthy
                    markets of the world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What of your assignments in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: I had six years of assignments in Washington and I was truly impressed
                    with the variety and quality of AID/W officers in both the foreign and domestic
                    service. True, the rationale for assisting the developing world is weakened now
                    that the communist menace has receded. I think this is unfortunate but it's a
                    reality vis a vis Congress. Space and communication technology have shrunk the
                    world. The U.S. opened up active trade with the developing world and sort of
                    jump started their trade by U.S. assistance programs in the 1950s and 1960s. It
                    is likely that the U.S. will use disaster relief as a major instrument in the
                    decade ahead. It is not costly, but it impresses a U.S. Judeo-Christian society
                    on its intent to help those who have been devastated by natural calamity. It is
                    clearly quite different from the massive flows of assistance dating from the
                    Marshall Plan through the early 1990s. Our large resources will probably flow
                    through the multilateral institutions. The tragedy would be if even these
                    institutions do not receive the level of U.S. support that they deserve.Eleven

                        connected to the work we had been doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: I think serendipity would be the link. We did not, as some have said, seek
                    the next appointment, but were called on the eve of our departure from Abidjan
                    by a member of the presidential search committee of International House, New
                    York. They asked for us to submit an application and to pass through New York on
                    our way to retirement in Michigan. We were offered the job on the spot. Perhaps
                    they were desperate. In early November 1982, we began an 11 year career on the
                    Upper West Side of New York City. My candidacy was enhanced first by my spouse
                    and secondly by my Foreign Service career. In my introduction to New York City
                    in “The New York Times” with I House board chairman Henry Kissinger, he said,
                    “Gordon, you are stupid.” I said, “Henry, I didn't come to New York to hear
                    this.” He replied, “But Gordon, no one works for Henry Kissinger twice.” We had
                    a very cordial relationship. I saw him maybe every other month during the four
                    years he continued on as chairman of the board.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is International House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: International House was founded in 1924 by the driving force of Lehigh
                    University engineer Harry Edmonds and the largesse of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.
                    It was created in the wake of World War I. It was designed with 500 small
                    student rooms with eight large public rooms, really a very beautiful building on
                    the Upper West Side close to Grant's Tomb and adjacent to Columbia University.
                    In 1982, there were 107 nationalities residing at this residential and program
                    center when we arrived. 97% were graduate students studying or training at over
                    100 institutions in greater New York. The average residence was just over two
                    years, while a three year stay was maximum. Edmonds, Rockefeller and others
                    theorized that living in this community would build friendships for a lifetime.
                    Residents and staff arranged a wide variety of programs each night. Residents
                    felt truly fortunate to be admitted. If one counts short term as well as long
                    term residence, over 60,000 have experienced this program since 1924. Each year,
                    the number of Americans residing aI House is limited to 30%. Having visited or
                    resided in over 95 countries before arriving at I House, interaction with its
                    residents was a joyful part of the presidency. Dr. Kissinger, in fact, had lived
                    north of I House in Manhattan when he arrived from Germany with his parents in
                    the mid-1930s. He chaired an illustrious I House board, including the
                    granddaughter of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., many heads of Fortune 500
                    corporations, banks, and service institutions. Working under the guidance of a
                    not-for-profit board with its seven committees was a new experience and a test
                    of one's resilience. The president was expected to carry a tin cup and to raise
                    considerable amounts of money, of course, with the assistance of the board of
                    trustees. One trustee and senior IBM executive said, “Gordon, I can see you have
                    many ideas. Please ensure that they are introduced to the board by another
                    trustee. Then we'll all buy into the concept if it's a good idea.” This was
                    helpful to me. I tried to follow that practice over my 11 years. Our board
                    consisted of a core of 35 and then we had international trustees from 10
                    countries of the world and honorary trustees including John J. McCloy, a former
                    chairman, David Rockefeller, Shelby Cullom Davis and, when he retired, Henry
                    Kissinger. It was a very powerful board that could do anything it decided to do.
                    Of course, it made the presidency just that much easier.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Gerald Ford enter the scene and what did that do
                        to our links in Michigan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>EVANS: Our links in Michigan were underscored because the chair of one of our
                    important committees was also from Michigan, so President Ford and this
                    individual plus the president were referred to as the “Michigan Mafia.” We were
                    very proud of that connection with the heartland, a very vital part of our
                    country. In 1985, we were fortunate to attract former President Gerald Ford to
                    replace Henry Kissinger as chairman. In the search committee, we had him listed
                    as number one. Most people said “Do not approach him.” We often felt that
                    because he jettisoned Nelson Rockefeller when he ran for the presidency in 1976
                    against Jimmy Carter, he always had a sense of guilt and that this was a payback
                    for a Rockefeller institution. We would hold our board meetings late in the
                    afternoon of the same day the American Express board met. President Ford, being
                    on both boards, would just be driven uptown in his ubiquitous Secret Service
                    car. He served four eventful years. In that four year period, we had 14 board
                    meetings, 12 of which he attended even though he lived most of the year in
                    either Southern California or in Colorado. He was replaced by John C. Whitehead,
                    the former Deputy Secretary of State, in 1989. In that year, we also purchased a
                    second building adjacent to I House for $15 million with assistance from the New
                    York State Dormitory Authority, where we obtained a low interest loan, and
                    increased our occupancy to 750 residents. During my tenure with tin cup in hand,
                    we raised over $11 million and engaged in a fairly extensive renovation program.
                    It should be pointed out that most buildings in New York average 15 years of
                    life and then they're torn down. International House is still going strong 75
                    years after it was constructed on the Upper West Side.</p>

                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>EVANS: Certainly there is no privacy in an environment such as that. Barbara and
                    I lived on the 10th floor of the building we purchased in 1989 from day one. We
                    would meet residents in elevators, on the sidewalk. We would eat some of our
                    meals in the beautiful dining room at International House. So, we were
                    constantly in the presence of those whom we theoretically were supervising and
                    whose programs we administered. I would say it was exhilarating at times and
                    tiring at other times. But there were approximately 15 programs of one sort or
                    another each week at I House. Of course, this was the heart of why people try so
                    hard to obtain residence there. It is not just that the cost per room is low (It
                    can average as low as $15/day.). But for example, when John Whitehead came
                    aboard, we introduced the Corporate Chairman Program in 1989. Over 20 Fortune
                    500 chairmen came to International House, dined with us, and spoke to a packed
                    auditorium or large public room. Always, there was a heavy accent on doing
                    business throughout the world. In other words, these chairmen had a global
                    perspective and felt very comfortable speaking with over 100 nationalities,
                    often 80 of whom would be represented in these meetings. Over its five years, I
                    believe, many misconceptions about corporate goals were corrected by the heads
                    of, for example, IBM, Texaco, American Express, Prudential-Ache, J.P. Morgan,
                    Dow Corning, Meade, Citicorp, AEA Investors, and the like.We also had an
                    international visitors program that attracted the UN Secretary General for a
                    question and answer evening to a packed auditorium; Bishop Tutu, who was both
                    vivid, lucid, and humorous; Kim Dae Jung, the current President of Korea;
                    Tatsuro Toyota, then president of Toyota Motors Worldwide and an alumnus of
                    International House; and many other dignitaries. The Marshall Visitor Program
                    (named for former Board Chairman George Marshall) brought such leaders as Sandra
                    Day O'Connor, Isaac Asimov, Leontyne Price, who was convinced to join our board,
                    David Rockefeller, and John J. McCloy. A National Cultural Hour was held every
                    Thursday evening, staged solely by the residents of that nation while the Night
                    of Nations welcomed benefit booths to raise money for the House each year.
                    International House was jam-packed on that occasion.</p>
                <p>Let me emphasize that this would be a very excellent follow-on career for any
                    retiring Foreign Service officer. In 1982, retired FSOs were presidents of the
                    Metropolitan Museum of Art, Asia Foundation, African-American Foundation, and
                    American Council, among others. There are approximately 70 international houses
                    that have students in residence throughout the world. Heads of 15 of these
                    houses, including those in Japan, the Cit� Universitaire in Paris, International
                    House in London, Sydney, and Melbourne get together every third year. The
                    experience that a Foreign Service officer has gleaned in his or her first career
                    is amply utilized in running an enterprise of this nature. The alumni of the
                    House have the privilege of being elected to what is called a World Council.
                    This body met every 18 months all over the world, including Berlin, Kyoto, New
                    Delhi, Sao Paulo, Johannesburg, and Prague. The Internet now has facilitated
                    interaction among alumni and current residents. We had one computer in 1982 when
                    I arrived. There were 65 when I left, plus probably five hundred PCs that were
                    owned and operated by residents. The current move is to tie these in with modems
                    throughout the 750 rooms at International House.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the real value to the residents and to us of
                        having served abroad for so long and then be able to greet foreign visitors
                        to this country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EVANS: I am not sure of the value to them, but the value to us was to feel as
                    though our earlier experiences were truly utilized, that we were comfortable in
                    the milieu of many, many nationalities resident at International House. When
                    problems of finance or of family loss or weakness through addiction would affect
                    a resident, we had similar experiences abroad. When there were killings in
                    certain countries, coups, the invasion of Lebanon by Israel, the breakdown of
                    the social structure in Yugoslavia, these produced enormous sadness and tensions
                    within concerned residents and we felt as though our experience could be
                    comforting. As I say, I recommend a career of this nature very strongly. I think
                    every effort should be made to have an international house on every university
                    campus.</p>
                <p>Closing</p>
                <p>Before I wrap this up, may I just say that, starting with our Fulbright year in
                    Norway, and the other 17 years abroad, and six years of service in Washington
                    and the 11 years in New York, one gets the feeling (and I have it very strongly)
                    that the United States miraculously is the most exciting social experiment in
                    the world. It is hard to conceive of the chaos that could have resulted in the
                    period 1945-1999 without the U.S. presence, its leadership and strong earlier
                    support of international institutions. Its ability to remain a leader of the
                    free world, with certain slips perhaps by being sucked into Vietnam, is anchored
                    in the basic objective of wanting people of the world to live free lives and to
                    live in a spiritual context that enriches their soul. Our national spirit was
                    omnipresent in our 36 years of interaction with people in four continents. It
                    was even acknowledged by critics of our country.</p>
                <p>We were active in the international arena until September of 1993 when we boarded
                    our 29 foot Chris Craft bound for Michigan over a 5,250 mile journey through the
                    eastern waterways. Just as in every step of my Foreign Service career and in
                    this interview process, my spouse, Barbara, has been at my side. One
                    recommendation I would make to the researcher is, if you can choose a life
                    partner of the quality, commitment, and love that I was lucky enough to find,
                    then the career's strains and stresses are comfortably accommodated. We had
                    spent just short of 36 years in one international arena or another. Little did
                    we realize that this would continue when we opened our bed and breakfast Between
                    the Lakes in Interlochen, Michigan in 1994. I want to thank you, Barbara, very
                    much for assisting me in this oral interview, but more importantly, for being at
                    my side throughout this very rich career.</p>
