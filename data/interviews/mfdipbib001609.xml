                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First of all, let's start at the beginning. Where were you
                        born? What about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I was born in Long Beach, California on January 26, 1924. My father and
                    mother came from Nebraska. They were part of a large migration that brought many
                    Nebraskans to Southern California. My paternal grandfather was of Swedish stock;
                    he had immigrated when he was about nine or ten years old. He went to South
                    Dakota to work in the gold mines in the Black Hills. I don't know much about my
                    paternal grandmother; she was raised in the Middle West and had some harrowing
                    stories to tell about encounters with the Indians. That much I do remember.</p>
                <p>My maternal grandfather, George Norris, was in politics; he was first a
                    Congressman from Nebraska and then Senator for a number of years. He had a lot
                    to do with the establishment of TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority). A dam in TVA
                    is named after him. His wife, my blood grandmother, died in childbirth; he
                    married another woman who raised his three daughters. I don't know anything
                    about this second wife, although she was a very strong prohibitionist. That
                    effected our lives at times in amusing ways.</p>
                <p>My paternal grandfather and grandmother moved to California in about 1920; then
                    the rest of the family followed them. As I said, I was born in Long Beach; my
                    father was in real estate with his father; they were very successful. In the
                    early days of Southern California, it was a very profitable business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you mother and father meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I am not sure; I used to think it happened when both were students at the
                    University of Nebraska, but I am not sure, although I think it is a reasonable
                    assumption. My mother's older sister also went to the University of Nebraska.
                    But I am not sure that my mother ever finished university. She went to school at
                    Goucher College, an institution in the Washington area, when her father was in
                    Congress.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>We moved from Long Beach to Hollywood in about 1926. My father and grandfather
                    made a lot of money in real estate, as I have mentioned. My parents built their
                    dream house in Glendale - a Tutor house. It was a beautiful place. We moved in
                    just before the depression, which then forced us to move out. They had to sell
                    the house to meet all their debts. So we moved across the canyon in Glendale -
                    about three or four miles away - to an interesting old house which was much more
                    fun for us kids. It had been partially burned down by a forest fire, but was
                    patched up. They rented the place for $50 per month. Eventually, we made more
                    repairs and built it up. It was our home for much of my youth. My parents
                    eventually bought the place. It survived until the freeways came along; now the
                    lot is part of a highway. That was very depressing to my father who really loved
                    the place. It was a wonderful place to grow up in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your father remain in the real estate business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: He did, but his real passion was the oil business. He did a lot of
                    prospecting; he was a very well respected business man in the Los Angeles area.
                    Even in the depression, it was not that hard for him to raise money for various
                    oil expeditions. There were some people who still had resources in the early
                    1930s; furthermore, oil exploration was a tax write-off ; that made investments
                    attractive, particularly for those in the high tax brackets. My father became
                    involved in some interesting explorations; I can remember going to the oil
                    fields often when he and his wild-catter friends would be drilling or trying to
                    find a new field. We would sit and wait for the gusher. I never saw one. So I
                    don't think my father was very successful in the oil business, but he did
                    develop a few small fields. He went on one expedition where the drilling was
                    down 15,000 feet; in the 1930s, that was a real feat. It was very expensive of
                    course. He finally had to quit that field because he just couldn't or wouldn't
                    ask for more money from anybody. Of course, a few years later one of the major
                    oil producers took over the field and drilled another 500 feet or so and hit pay
                    dirt - a major gusher! So my father was right about the location. He always used
                    to say that the oil was there; it was just a matter of finding it.</p>
                <p>So oil exploration was the love of his life, but the income for the family came
                    from the real estate business.</p>
                <p>I went to Glendale high school and then to Occidental College when WWII came
                    along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was life like at home? Did you have brothers and
                        sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>NELSON: I had two younger sisters. I was the oldest child. My mother was very
                    much involved in politics; she was an avid Democrat. For a while, she headed up
                    the League of Women Voters chapter in Los Angeles County. This attachment to
                    politics of course came from her life experiences with her father. She continued
                    her almost fanatic interest in politics until she died four years ago at the age
                    of 101.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I remember that particularly in the early 1930s,
                        politics was a consuming business for a lot of people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Quite right. The bookshelves were filled with books about politics and
                    the muckrakers like Upton Sinclair were riding high. Then there was the Townsend
                    plan. That was something. I can remember when we moved from our up-scale house
                    to the considerably more modest dwelling, I went to a little grammar school at
                    the bottom of the hill on which we were living. That was a three room school.
                    The playground was in very bad shape. This was a fairly conservative community,
                    but I was a supporter of FDR. We used to fight about politics on the playground.
                    It was a very activist time.</p>
                <p>That was a very intense period, in part because a lot of people were afraid; they
                    didn't know how to escape from the terrible economic conditions. I can remember
                    when the banks were closed; I never understood that - I was too young. But it
                    was obviously a very difficult period. My parents were very good; they were
                    living on the margin, but they never made us kids feel that the family was in
                    trouble. In retrospect, I now know that we really were in great difficulties. As
                    I said, particularly my mother, felt very strongly about the political scene and
                    about bringing the economic crisis to an end through some political actions.</p>
                <p>We used dinner time as forum for discussions. I liked that even though we used to
                    sit sometime for hours. The subject usually would be politics, although sometime
                    we listened to a discussion of the oil business. Sunday morning breakfast used
                    to be outside; sometimes those meals would last until three o'clock in the
                    afternoon. Those meals were really gripping; that is what really got me
                    interested in the public service. I was not sure which part of that service I
                    would enter, but it ended up with me becoming a Foreign Service officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your father more Republican oriented in light of his
                        business interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Not really. He had a great sense of what was fair. He was very
                    uncomfortable with the economic extremes; whether it was wealth or poverty. He
                    was a very gentle and considerate man. He also had a great sense of humor. As I
                    said, he was not a successful oil man, which might have had some influence on
                    his political views. He used to say that he wasn't a gambler, by which I think
                    he meant to say that he was not a big gambler. He didn't go to the poker or any
                    other gaming tables. In general, we had a liberal household, driven by my
                    mother's spirit.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kinds of things did you read?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I was not a good reader; I didn't do a lot of it. My step-grandmother,
                    whom I didn't know very well, gave me books; she saw me as the coming light in
                    the family and she tried to stimulate my curiosity. I read some; my mother
                    encouraged me a lot and we did have a lot of books. But I didn't really begin to
                    enjoy reading until I was a senior in high school or maybe even later. Then I
                    couldn't get enough. My second wife on the other hand read from the first moment
                    she could recognize a letter. I did enjoy Steinbeck and Sinclair and Jack
                    London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being in or near Hollywood were movies at all of
                        interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We lived among people who were in the movie business, but I really was
                    not interested except that a lot of money for political efforts came from the
                    movie industry. Since my mother was deeply involved, she knew a lot of the
                    donors. My dad sold them a lot of houses. I can still remember when my father
                    and a school friend of his opened up a very posh area of Beverly Hills. A lot of
                    the movie people bought houses there. My grandfather had a very big house; it
                    used to sit by itself in a large field and I can still remember the meadows
                    around it. Gradually, of course, the land was sold off and other houses began to
                    be built there by my father and his partner. When it came time for my
                    grandparents to move to smaller quarters, my father handled the transaction and
                    sold the house to Laurel of Laurel and Hardy fame. I remember that because my
                    father came home one day with an autographed picture from the comedians. My
                    father and I thought they were the greatest comedians of their time.</p>
                <p>I am not sure how many movies I in fact did see. I was forbidden to go to the
                    movies until I was late in elementary school. My mother was very liberal in her
                    attitude towards me; she let me do all sorts of things. I am not quite sure why
                    she trusted me so much. But movies were out until I was seven or eight. I tried
                    to sneak off for a couple, but I got caught. That was tough because I didn't
                    like to act contrary to my mother's wishes. I did have a friend, Bill Webber,
                    down the street and he and I got permission to go the Saturday matinees at the
                    Carmel theater on Santa Monica Boulevard which was about a mile from my house.
                    The films were silent; I could not read fast enough to catch all the
                    explanations, but my friend, who was a Swiss immigrant and who had learned
                    English later than I did, had no trouble keeping up with the sub-titles. He
                    would then tell me what was going on. That was a friendship that has lasted
                    until his death about four years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Glendale educational system?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>NELSON: As I mentioned, the elementary school was tiny. We had two or three
                    grades in one classroom with one teacher. There were probably 25-30 students in
                    each classroom. I can remember one outstanding teacher; my fourth and fifth
                    grade teacher was Mrs. Badour. I remember in part because my younger sister, who
                    lives nearby in Fairfax, talks about her periodically. Mrs. Anderson who had the
                    sixth grade, was the fantastic teacher; she undoubtedly made a lot of difference
                    in my life. I learned about integrity from her, as much as I could from someone
                    who was not a member of the family. I also learned compassion from her, in
                    addition of course to the course lessons. We used to go back to see Mrs.
                    Anderson. When she had ended her teaching day, we would come from our junior
                    high school on our bicycles. She was tired after a day's work and undoubtedly
                    wanted to go home. But she had to stay and listen to us telling her what we were
                    doing and she would patiently listen to us. She was just one of those persons
                    that appear in your life and leave a permanent imprint. She had everything and
                    was a large motivator for me.</p>
                <p>Then I went to Woodrow Wilson Junior High School, which was co-located with the
                    high school. It was a pretty big school, although I don't remember exactly how
                    many students attended. I can't say that I remember much of my junior high
                    school days. I rode my bicycle to school for about five miles each way. It was
                    down hill to the school, but it was a struggle at the end of the day to get back
                    home. We had buses, but my friends and I insisted on using our bicycles; it was
                    an era when the roads were not completely jammed with cars, although there were
                    some risky places. On some days, we would catch the bus, but we tried to bicycle
                    whenever we could.</p>
                <p>Glendale High School, which, as I said, was on the same grounds as Woodrow
                    Wilson, was a huge school - about 3,000 students. My graduating class totaled
                    900 students. It was an unusual situation because in those days, schools used to
                    be rather small.</p>

                <p>NELSON: I can't really grade it; I did moderately well by their standards. I
                    began to learn Spanish; I learned a lot about science which I enjoyed. I just
                    told my wife that I did take one semester of Latin at Glendale because my
                    paternal grandfather said I should - and I trusted his judgment. The civics -
                    now known as political science - classes were interesting. As was required for
                    all, I had to take chemistry. That was fun; the teacher was the band leader who
                    had never taught chemistry before. So we were learning together and that made
                    for lots of entertainment. He said that he could teach us to play various
                    instruments, but that chemistry was going to be new to all of us. Fortunately,
                    he turned out to be a pretty good teacher and we learned the rudiments of
                    chemistry.</p>

                <p>NELSON: I did not participate in extra-curricular activities to any great extent.
                    I happened to be looking at my year book recently and found that I had been
                    president of the Spanish club. I must say that I have no recollection of that at
                    all. I am not sure that added up to very much. I had a small group of friends.
                    Football of course was the big thing and I gave some consideration to trying
                    out. I didn't play, but some of my friends did; so I served as a water boy. I
                    traveled with the team, but after one year of doing that I tried tennis, where I
                    played on the second string team. Extra curricular activities were just not that
                    important to me; in some respects, I was very much a loner. I used to have to
                    hurry home right after school to do some jobs in the neighborhood as well in our
                    house. That old house was on about three acres with eucalyptus trees; there was
                    never any end to what I could do on our property.</p>
                <p>I also had a very close buddy with whom I cycled a lot. We cycled all over
                    California. One year, we took a train to Seattle and bicycled back. We had what
                    I called a “racing” bike. By today's standards, it weighted a ton. It had
                    smaller tires - not the tiny ones - and it had handle bars turned down - I
                    turned them up. We made special packs to put on our racks and we camped on the
                    way. We did a lot of that which was very enjoyable.</p>
                <p>We had a small group in high school who always had lunch together. We brought our
                    lunches. In the group were my younger cousin, my cycling buddy, a budding
                    photographer - never very successful, but made his living that way - , Senator
                    Nye's son, who had moved to California with his mother after his father
                    developed a fondness for some other woman, and another fellow who became a
                    doctor. We would eat together and play penny ante poker. That was our little
                    social group. I had a couple of girl friends with whom I went to dances. But it
                    was the guys who were my focus; as I said, I didn't really get involved in
                    school activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you graduate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I graduated in 1942.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your high school days, was there much conversation
                        around the family table about events overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>NELSON: There were discussions about events overseas. I really had not
                    appreciated that so much. I mentioned that there was a group close to my family
                    that consisted primarily of teachers and school administrators - younger than my
                    parents, but who also had been impacted by the depression. They met each other
                    at political meetings and became good friends. These people would get together
                    several times during the year for dinners or barbecues at our house. These
                    get-togethers were lots of fun and interesting. They would discuss current
                    events and then would make predictions about the coming year. One would record
                    these predictions and would read them the following year. Most predictions were
                    off target, but it was a very interesting exercise.</p>
                <p>They must have been paying considerable attention to Asia because my father, who
                    was not as knowledgeable as the others in the group but who paid attention,
                    predicted that the U.S. would be dragged into a war in Asia by the Japanese. He
                    thought that the U.S. would be attacked somewhere 7 � miles north-east of Pearl
                    Harbor. You can imagine how surprised the group was when it opened that
                    prediction on New Year's Eve in 1941. The European conflict of course also got
                    considerable attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am interested in the development of a future Foreign
                        Service officer. Was geography thrust on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: It was not thrust on me; I learned eagerly. I was very interested in
                    Latin America. I did a lot of special projects in school on that area.
                    Ironically, I never served there. I studied Spanish in part because my mother
                    was a great believer in learning other languages. She studied Spanish as well.
                    My father did too, although he didn't get very far. My mother traveled to Mexico
                    on several occasions. There was a considerable Spanish-speaking population in
                    Los Angeles even in my days. I found California history quite fascinating; I
                    became a buff in it. I learned all about the missions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Pearl Harbor and subsequent events impact on you
                        in your senior year in high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We had some friends who had moved to Hawaii. They had been school friends
                    of my parents. The woman was seriously crippled by arthritis. They thought that
                    the Hawaii climate might ease her pains. Their business was in Omaha; so the
                    father, Wilbur, used to travel back and forth. In those days, of course, the
                    mode of travel was ships - the Luralei and Matsunia. In 1938, he stayed with us
                    when he was traveling back to Hawaii. I went upstairs after dinner to do my
                    homework. I had told him jokingly that I would be ready to go with him the next
                    day when he was boarding the ship.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The next day, I went to school. At about 10:00 o'clock, I was called to the
                    principal's office. I wondered what transgression I had committed. He told me
                    that he was sending for a taxi to take me home because I was about to go to
                    Hawaii. My parents were like that. Wilbur had asked them to let me come because
                    he had a son my age. So off I went and stayed for a year. I must say that I fell
                    in love with one of the island girls. I really didn't want to leave even after a
                    year. I did go home, but at the first opportunity, I signed on the Matsunia as a
                    seaman for the summer and sailed to Hawaii only to find that the girl had lost
                    all interest in me. In Hawaii, I went to Roosevelt High School which was about
                    one and a half miles from our house in the Punch Bowl. We had to wear shoes in
                    school, but didn't have to do so in going and coming from school. So I used to
                    tie the shoes together and carry them around my neck. I just reveled in the life
                    on the islands. It was fantastic.</p>
                <p>We did a lot of dancing, which I loved. We danced on the quad at noon which had
                    music. We danced at night. You couldn't go barefooted, so we wore little
                    Japanese slippers. It was a wonderful life for kids. It was very comfortable and
                    you could do a lot of stuff in those slippers.</p>
                <p>So I had this connection with Hawaii. In fact, I had signed off to crew on the
                    ship during the 1941 Christmas holidays; unfortunately, the Japanese interfered
                    with those plans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your responsibilities on the ship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: The lowest possible job. You had to go to the union hall - the communist
                    union run by Harry Bridges. He was a great political power for years. I had to
                    join the union; I still have my papers from those days. When you went to the
                    hall, you just took a chance. It was a matter of luck if you got on board a
                    ship. Fortunately, each time I went, I was successful because I was not a
                    regular union member. I was what was called a “scallion,” which meant you had to
                    do whatever was asked of you. I worked in the galley; I hauled 300 pounds of ice
                    from the trucks onto a rolling ship. It was fun; you would be pushing up hill at
                    one moment and downhill in the next. Once, I made forty pieces of toast and
                    spread butter on them with a paint brush. That was the kind of unusual work that
                    I had to do. Of course, I had the worst possible bunk in the ship. But it was an
                    eye-opener for me. I think if my parents had known how hard and perilous the
                    work was, I think they would have said that they would have preferred if I found
                    some other employment. But they didn't know and I had no inkling before I
                    started. I learned to deal with it.</p>
                <p>But this connection allowed me to know where the bombing took place. The impact
                    on us as far as our livelihood was concerned was primarily a plus because with
                    the war came a certain amount of prosperity to southern California. Lots of
                    people came and my dad's business blossomed. My mother was deeply concerned by
                    the politics of the events. I soon became available for the draft.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there Nisei at Glendale high?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: There were a few. It was a terrible chapter in our history when we
                    interned these Americans of Japanese descent. My mother had Nisei friends. The
                    market where she shopped was run by Nisei. The cleaners were also Nisei. They
                    served us but were also our friends. We didn't socialize with them because we
                    had little in common, but they were friends. When they were interned, my
                    household was quite upset. It was very hard particularly for my mother who was
                    an avid supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt. But she could not accept our policy
                    towards the Nisei. It disturbed her for the rest of her life. She thought that
                    FDR had betrayed his ideals. It was also stupid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We didn't lock up the Japanese-Americans in Hawaii.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: That is right. We would have had to lock up most of the population. I
                    should mention that I really loved the Hawaiian society. There were all kinds of
                    people on the islands. It was glorious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose that when you graduated in 1942, you were
                        prepared to enter military service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Certainly. But I had another year before I was drafted. I had registered
                    immediately but was not called until 1943. In August 1942 I signed up for the
                    V-12 Navy program which was not activated for another year. So I went off to
                    Occidental College until the V-12 program was activated. Occidental was one of
                    the colleges which participated. I spent my sophomore year there as a
                    seaman-student.</p>
                <p>Then I went to Columbia for the “90 day wonder school.” Then I became an ensign.
                    I had a couple of choices then. In my case, it was a meaningful choice. My
                    choices I think were interesting. I should have noted that I was quite a
                    swimmer; I enjoyed it greatly. I thought therefore that underwater demolition
                    might be an interesting assignment. The other option I had was Russian language
                    training. That tied into my international affairs interests. So I had a
                    rationale for either option; the first would have had me engaged in the war and
                    the other could have been useful for the future. So I was sent to the language
                    school - probably for the good of the nation and the safety of other underwater
                    demolition Navy men.</p>
                <p>I took Russian language training at the University of Colorado. That is where the
                    Navy had its language school. The majority of students were studying Japanese or
                    Malaysian or other Asian languages. There were five Russian language students as
                    well. I met my future wife there; she was the younger sister of a colleague who
                    was also studying Russian. We had four Russian teachers which helped greatly in
                    our learning. They were very hard-fisted task masters and very good. We learned
                    Russian! I spent six months at the university.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the language system? Did you learn dialogue and
                        then held conversations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: It was an oral approach. We learned very little grammar. We discussed it
                    periodically, but we were supposed to learn the language structure from our
                    conversations. It was very similar to the FSI method, which I always found very
                    successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Navy planning to use you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: It was anticipated at that point that we would be fighting a long war in
                    Asia with the Russians against the Japanese. I was told that this would be a
                    long struggle. We would need to work with the Russians. Of course, the war
                    really came to an end before I was finished with all my learning and a couple of
                    assignments. So, they sent me first to Washington to work on some military
                    dictionaries. Then I went to New York to attend an intelligence school. Then to
                    Europe where I worked for a little while as an interpreter for one of the
                    commissions that met in Berlin. But by then, we had too many Russian language
                    officers; so I was sent to Kiel to work as a liaison officer with the British
                    Navy. I did that for a year and a half before I was discharged in August
                    1946.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your language training, what were your teachers
                        saying about Soviet society?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: They were all �migr�s and therefore very anti-Soviet. They had had lots
                    of interesting experiences. They were very much imbedded in Russian ethos which
                    made them very interesting. We learned a lot about Russia, but little about the
                    Soviets whom they did not know because they had left Russia before the Soviets
                    really came to power. They were not happy with what had happened to their
                    country but were pretty much resigned to the realities. I remember reading
                    Pushkin and Tolstoy. The Russian language is really quite beautiful and very
                    powerful. I think later when I met Russians I felt that their emotions were more
                    evident than in the case of others. That was true even among the military;
                    Russians are quite emotional. I was very impressed by them.</p>
                <p>It was during the language training that I began to seriously consider the
                    Foreign Service. My language colleague - the brother of my wife-to-be - J.T.
                    Kendrick. He had been in the Foreign Service in Latin America. I had very high
                    regard for him. I recently said goodbye to him; he was heading for Cambridge
                    University to study for 18 months at the age of 80. He stayed in the Foreign
                    Service after the war but retired many years before I did.</p>

                <p>NELSON: I never heard any doubts about the nature of the Stalin regime. I think I
                    came out of the language school very pro-Soviet. They were, after all, our
                    allies in fighting the bad guys. We didn't pay much attention to the negative
                    side. Even the pact with the Germans which preceded the Soviets entry into WWII
                    did not register until much later with me. I had a very naive view of the Soviet
                    Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your Berlin Commission work on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We were mainly dividing up the spoils of war. Most of the work was
                    connected with the movement of industrial capacities from Germany to the Soviet
                    Union. The British did not have a Russian language officer, so when I was in
                    Kiel I helped in moving small boats to the Soviet Union. The British ran convoys
                    through mine fields to Poland where the Soviets took them. There weren't many
                    boats, but my language training came in handy in helping the British work out
                    arrangements with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Soviets you dealt with at all leery?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Not at all. They were very warm and seemed open to me - perhaps I was
                    misled in that. They had been greatly misled about the U.S. My Russian was not
                    really good enough to explore some of the more profound subjects. I could use it
                    for everyday work, but I could not carry on an intensive political conversation.
                    So my impressions were somewhat superficial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were discharged in 1946. What happened next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: A very high priority was getting married. I had met this charming woman
                    in Colorado. Her sister moved to New York, and she came to join her. Both worked
                    for a model agency, doing administrative work. So we met in New York and then
                    went to California to meet my parents. Then I went to her home which was on a
                    farm in Oklahoma to ask her father's permission to marry his daughter. I spent
                    Christmas on the farm and then married in June, 1947.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go back to Occidental College?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>NELSON: Yes, I did to get my bachelor's degree. I majored in political science.
                    As I said, my interest in the Foreign Service had been stimulated by my
                    brother-in-law as well as the Russian language training. So when I returned to
                    Occidental, I was already interested in pursuing the Foreign Service
                    possibility. I looked at other possibilities, but not seriously. One option was
                    to join my father in his real estate business, although I doubt that I would
                    have been much good at it. But that didn't seem to me to be a very satisfactory
                    career, so I didn't pursue it very far.</p>
                <p>I got my bachelor's degree in 1947 after which I rushed to Oklahoma for my
                    wedding. We returned to Occidental where I took a year of graduate studies and
                    she attended college which she had not previously completed. The Foreign Service
                    was very much on my mind, but instead we decided to go to Sweden for a year. I
                    attended the University of Stockholm while my wife, bless her soul, threw
                    herself into learning the language. She got herself a job as a secretary to a
                    little diesel motor company. She did their English correspondence and she
                    answered the telephones. She used to have great stories about her coping with
                    Swedes on the phone, but she managed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was going to Sweden a return to your “roots”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: It was in a way. When I was in Kiel, I could get to Denmark and Sweden
                    rather easily. I had gotten a name of a Swedish person from my grandfather. I
                    was successful in finding him. That led me to all sorts of relatives. I learned
                    to have schnapps for breakfast; those country folks were something else. That
                    stimulated my interest in returning to Sweden for a more extended period. I
                    still had some part of my GI bill rights left, which I used to finance my
                    attendance at Stockholm University. A lot of other people were going abroad
                    using the GI bill to finance their overseas education. They went to France or
                    England or Switzerland. I wanted to do something a little different which was
                    one more reason I chose Sweden. There was a small group of us who went to
                    Stockholm. It was a great year. So my trip to Sweden had some connection with
                    “roots” and some connection with doing something a little different - not doing
                    what everybody else was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am sure you recognized the GI bill was not going to
                        sustain you forever. When did you focus on a career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I had been in the military long enough that I had some more years to go
                    on the GI bill. I wanted to use them, but I didn't use all of them. I did return
                    to the U.S. to attend Fletcher School of International Law and Diplomacy for one
                    year, which I completed in 1950. Then I really had to face the prospects of
                    employment. I obviously had my sights on the Foreign Service. Before going to
                    Fletcher, I took the exam - the three and a half days ordeal. I finished my work
                    there and had received my master's degree. But I had not passed the oral exam;
                    so I had to try again, which I did in 1950.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Fletcher in the 1949-50 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: It was a very small school. Just this week, my class is trying to put
                    together a 50th anniversary; I think about twelve people said they would attend.
                    I don't think my class was larger than 35 or 40 students. It was a diverse
                    group. We didn't live with other students; we lived in Cambridge and then
                    Boston. She got a job in Boston. So we didn't really participate in the campus
                    life; I went to Fletcher for the academic work. In retrospect, we probably
                    should have been closer to the campus life because perhaps I missed some
                    opportunities. I still enjoyed and found it fulfilling, but our community
                    participation was not as great as it might have been. The classes were small;
                    the staff was very impressive; and the final exams very intimidating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you remember of the first Foreign Service oral
                        exam - the one you did not pass?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Most of the questions were on literature to see whether I had done enough
                    reading; I obviously had not. So thereafter, I spent a lot of time reading. When
                    I came back for the second round, I think the board had pretty well decided that
                    it would pass me anyway. The second examination was rather perfunctory. I think
                    the first panel's concern was legitimate if that was the standard for everyone;
                    I did not meet it. It just took me two tries to meet the standard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do between the two oral exams?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I took a job. We had to eat. I really didn't know what we were going to
                    do after having been rejected by the first panel. I don't think my approach at
                    the time was very realistic. It so happen that the head of the political science
                    department of Bowdoin College was touring schools in the Boston area. He needed
                    an instructor for his department. So I decided to look into it. I was
                    interviewed by him; he was very decisive since he had done so many interviews in
                    his life. After a while, he said that he had seen enough and was ready to make
                    an offer. I said that was fine with me and so I was hired.</p>
                <p>The experience at Bowdoin College was a great one. I came very close to deciding
                    to stay in academia and forgetting about the Foreign Service. The college at the
                    time consisted of about 800 students - all male. The president was a Mr. Sills.
                    Bowdoin had been in existence for about 200 years and had had only eight
                    presidents. Once appointed, you stayed forever. My colleagues were very
                    accomplished and decent people. My wife and I discussed the possibilities a lot.
                    She worked on her degree at Colby College which was within driving distance. She
                    enjoyed that. So we both were very reluctant to leave, but I said that I had put
                    a lot of time and effort in getting ready for the Foreign Service and that we
                    might regret it if we didn't try. So we proceeded.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You entered the Foreign Service in 1950. Did you attend
                        the basic officer's course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I entered in October and went right into the course. I thought our group
                    was very diverse. We had couple of women, which was still unusual in those days.
                    They were very talented. Larkin was the name of one; she was very forceful. I
                    must say that I don't remember much of my class. I was still a loner and
                    therefore did not interact very much with my classmates. I got along well with
                    them, but I didn't have much camaraderie with them. My wife came to Washington
                    with me, but then we discovered that we would not be leaving until January,
                    1951. That would give her enough time to finish her BA if she hurried back to
                    Occidental. She went back to California and lived with my parents. She got her
                    BA.</p>
                <p>I had an uncle and aunt in Washington, so I was not entirely on my own. I just
                    went to class and then did my own thing. So I don't have much of a recollection
                    of my class. As best as I can remember, they were good folks, very interesting
                    and very diverse. I do remember the women because they were so impressive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have some thoughts at the time in what you might
                        to specialize?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I still wanted to go to Latin America. I had taken both Russian and
                    Spanish and passed both exams. My first assignment was to Latin America -
                    Guayaquil. But our assignment was changed. It was changed for a very
                    compassionate reason. My brother-in-law had just been divorced. He was stationed
                    in Germany. The director of personnel knew my brother-in-law and knew that he
                    was hurting. So he asked us whether it would be useful if we were assigned to
                    Copenhagen so that my wife could be near him, which I thought was a very
                    thoughtful suggestion. I discussed it with my wife and agreed to go to
                    Copenhagen.</p>
                <p>So a very recently married coupled with no children was sent to Denmark. Not bad!
                    We were there from 1952 to 1956.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Denmark at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: This was during the early days of NATO and there was a lot of debate on
                    whether Denmark should join. The tensions with the Soviets were running very
                    high. There was a lot of uncertainty about American influence - a subject that
                    was being discussed in many countries. I still have a newspaper cartoon which
                    showed the changing of the guard at the royal palace; only the troops were
                    American GIs shown as a sloppy, crummy looking bunch of guys. It was very funny.
                    It was almost on the mark! It showed a friendly and humorous concern that the
                    Danes had.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>During my tour, the first defection of a Soviet MIG took place. He flew to
                    Bornholm. It was a big story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I started as a consular officer. After a year, I joined the political
                    section. Our ambassador was Eugenie Anderson, an outstanding person from Red
                    Wing, Minnesota.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you mention your connection with Senator Norris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I wouldn't have dared to do so. That is something I learned from my
                    mother; we were not to use the Senator's name, and I think she was absolutely
                    right. The Senator would have been quite displeased.</p>
                <p>Anderson was an outstanding ambassador and she had a superb DCM, Jack Bell, who
                    became a sort of a mentor and a great friend. As I said, I spent one year as a
                    vice consul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you remember about your consular work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We had the usual number of Americans in jail. We had a lot of seamen who
                    got into trouble. One day, one of these seamen came in to see me. I had seen him
                    before when he was in some sort of trouble. He told me that his ship had left,
                    and he was stranded in Denmark. So we had to repatriate him.</p>
                <p>I had a very unfortunate case of an American woman whose Danish husband had died,
                    leaving her penniless. She wanted to return to the U.S. So I arranged free
                    passage on a freighter which could be done on those days with the captain's
                    permission. We had no resources at the time for repatriation. I think it was
                    some sort of miracle whenever we were able to find free passage. We did have
                    some money to provide an allowance to pay for food and sundries. But I didn't
                    realize that she was an alcoholic. So she showed up at the ship, drunk and in
                    bad condition. The captain refused to let her board. But the next day, I gave
                    the captain the money and he allowed the woman to board. That took some
                    persuasion, but I convinced him that as long she didn't have any money, she
                    couldn't get any alcohol. As far as I know she was delivered to the U.S. This
                    was my first lesson in naivet� when working with people who you are trying to
                    help, but who do not help themselves.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Then there was a young man who came through during Christmas time. We had been
                    taught in the indoctrination course never to use your money to help destitute
                    Americans. This man was headed for Norway for reasons that I don't remember now.
                    He asked me for $10 for bus fare; I knew I couldn't get government assistance
                    for him, and I did have the money in my pocket. So I loaned him the money and
                    much to my surprise, a few weeks later I got the money back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a visa fraud problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I was not conscious of any efforts to obtain visas fraudulently. I had
                    very little to do with visa issuances in any case. I was working on passports
                    and protection of Americans. So if there were major problems, I was not aware of
                    them. Redman Duggan, our consul, was an exceedingly cautious man. I don't
                    remember him ever mentioning any problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the annual Fourth of July
                        celebration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Certainly; it was a major event in Copenhagen. We had a very nice
                    ambassadorial residence. I don't think at the time the list of invitees was
                    quite as large as it has become in more recent years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you make any close Danish friends?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We did establish some very good relations. Next week, my wife and I are
                    going to Europe. First we are going to England to visit some friends; then she
                    is going to Amsterdam for a business conference; we will then meet in Copenhagen
                    to see some old Danish friends. I should mention that this is my second wife who
                    was not with me during my Copenhagen tour, but she has met these Danes and has
                    also become friends with them. I have a Danish God-daughter and have in effect
                    adopted her daughter as our Danish God-grand-daughter. We have a place there,
                    and these people have become sort of family. These friendships all stemmed from
                    my first tour in Copenhagen. We adopted our oldest child in Copenhagen. He was a
                    Swedish national. So when we adopted him, he was given a diplomatic visa in his
                    Swedish passport - as a son of an American diplomat. Among our close Danish
                    friends is an attorney who arranged the adoption and the convoluted passport
                    document.</p>
                <p>I hadn't realized that making friends with the Danes was any kind of problem. I
                    have heard that although they are very friendly, it sometimes difficult to break
                    into their inner circles. I never found that. Of course, we were there when all
                    of Europe was still trying to recover from a horrible war. It may well have been
                    that everyone was more open to Americans particularly.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That raised the question of how the Danes viewed the
                        Germans in the early 1950s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Not at all friendly. They were edgy about their neighbors although they
                    recognized that Germany was pretty much under the control of the Allies. The
                    control was tight enough to limit our access to and through Germany only through
                    some specific routes or limited transportation ways - e.g. closed trains.</p>
                <p>The Danes managed to deal with the Germans during the war and delighted in
                    fooling the Germans sufficiently to become an escape route for Jews fleeing
                    Germany and other parts of Europe. The lawyer I mentioned was one of the leaders
                    of this “underground” escape route. He unfortunately was shot while trying to
                    help the Jews and is today crippled by the wounds. He is barely able to walk.
                    Not surprisingly, even today he bears a resentment against the Germans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Soviets were quite close to Denmark at the time. Was
                        there concern that they might make a move?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Certainly. They were stationed right across the water in L�beck in
                    Germany. And the island of Bornholm was very close to Soviet occupied territory.
                    So the Danes did worry. My wife and I were first alerted to this when upon our
                    arrival, we were housed in the Koden Hotel which was right on the waterfront.
                    The morning after our arrival, we noticed large numbers of troop on the docks.
                    People were scurrying around with guns. We wondered whether some action was
                    under way. Fortunately, we discovered it was just an exercise. It was enough to
                    worry us and to raise some questions in our minds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Copenhagen in 1953, when the Berlin riots
                        broke out. I was in Darmstadt at the time in the military and we were
                        ordered not to leave our barracks. It was a very tense moment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We didn't really understand what was going on and whether anyone could
                    keep events from getting out of control. We had enough of these kinds of
                    incidents by that time so that when a new one popped out, people were not overly
                    alarmed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large was the political section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: It was a small embassy. I think there must have been just a couple of
                    political officers in it. In fact, I think that Jack Bell, the DCM, and I
                    covered the political landscape. We spent our time talking to the political
                    leadership. There were several parties in the parliament, and I spent most of my
                    time talking to the fringe groups. The contacts with the major parties were
                    reserved for the ambassador and the DCM.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>One of my contacts was with the representative of the “Single Tax” party; he was
                    the sole member of parliament from that group. He tried to explain “single” tax
                    to me several times, but I can't say that it made much of a dent. It was an
                    interesting time in Denmark; I got to meet most of the Danish political
                    leadership. How useful any of this was one never knows.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Danes have a socialist society at the time as the
                        Swedes had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I don't think so, My impression was that it was a different society from
                    Sweden having observed that one a few years earlier when I was a student. One of
                    my classmates whom I didn't know very well was Olaf Palme, who became prime
                    minister in 1969. Erlander was the prime minister when I was there and for many
                    years thereafter - until 1969. They espoused a socialist philosophy, but I have
                    the impression that despite the rhetoric, today the country is far from being a
                    socialist state. The Danes never went in that direction, even though the
                    socialist party was very strong. But the leadership of the country was changed
                    often enough to prevent any radical departures from the norm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests in Denmark at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I think we were principally interested in assuring that Denmark remain a
                    solid and forceful member of NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major issues between us and Denmark?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I don't think so. We didn't run into many negative attitudes toward the
                    U.S. I am sure that a few Danes may have held them, but it was not a general
                    attitude. As I said, they were still recovering from a very difficult period in
                    their history, and we were providing major relief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many communist adherents in Denmark?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: No. There were some intellectuals and students who spoke in favor of the
                    Soviet Union, but it was a very small minority. We of course considered this
                    fringe to be very unrealistic. Even today there are still a few supporters of
                    Russia and one has to wonder why. There was a small peace movement led by some
                    members of the cultural community. I remember once that a visa was issued to a
                    Danish cello player who turned up on one of Senator McCarthy's lists. Our consul
                    was thoroughly shaken, but he was never punished for issuing the visa.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were McCarthy's activities well known in Denmark?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Oh, yes. It was a very bad time for the U.S. and particularly the Foreign
                    Service. As I mentioned earlier, my wife and I had only committed ourselves to
                    trying the Foreign Service. During the McCarthy era, we were very close to
                    leaving it because we felt that he was an unchecked rogue who was doing serious
                    harm to our interests and certainly was not representing the principles for
                    which we thought the U.S. stood. We considered Secretary Dulles extremely
                    cowardly, and my wife and I felt that we could not really work for this
                    administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your embassy colleagues expressing similar
                        dismay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Absolutely. Jack Bell was replaced as DCM by Luke Battle, who was more or
                    less a political appointee, although certainly not a newcomer to the Department.
                    The story was that he was sent to Denmark to get him out of the Department
                    because he was too liberal and therefore suspect for Senator McCarthy. He was
                    sent to Denmark in order to protect him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Scott McLeod was McCarthy's eyes and ears in the
                        Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: That's right. It was a bad time for the Department of State. People were
                    treated badly. So we came close to resigning from the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By 1954, were you still on the fence about the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I think lethargy had set in by that time. I didn't have an alternative.
                    Furthermore we had come to like the work and life-style; so I guess you can say
                    that by that time we were hooked. You may remember that by this time, we had a
                    Refugee Relief Act which had not been well implemented, at least as far as
                    Congress was concerned. Because of Congressional pressures, the Department
                    decided to open a number of new consular offices to handle the additional
                    work-load. So we were suddenly ordered to go to Naples to join the Refugee
                    Relief staff there. We were given ten days to report. So we sold our car, packed
                    up our belongings, etc. The night before we were supposed to leave we were told
                    that our orders had been canceled and we were to stay in Denmark. So we had to
                    start all over again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the Naples debacle, what happened in 1955?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We stayed in Denmark one more year.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what happened in 1956?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Then we were told to return to Washington where I was assigned to INR
                    (the Bureau of Intelligence and Research) where I worked in the Scandinavian
                    Affairs office. This office covered Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Sweden and
                    Finland. The Finns were not always happy to be with these other countries
                    because they had been a Swedish colony for 600 years and wanted to distance
                    themselves from these other northern countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your office's main concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: As I remember we were concerned about Iceland's continued participation
                    in NATO. Iceland was very important to us, but the Icelanders were not totally
                    supportive of their membership in NATO, especially as the Cold War was heating
                    up. It was an important base for us so that Soviet submarines operating in the
                    northern Atlantic could be monitored. There was an Icelander political party
                    which we considered as communist and pro-Soviet. That worried us a great
                    deal.</p>
                <p>Greenland was also important to us also because of the bases we had there. That
                    made it important that the Danes not waver in their participation in NATO.</p>
                <p>We worried about Finland because it had to make some concessions to the Soviets
                    in light of their geographical situation. They had lost a war with the Soviets
                    and were paying huge reparations; they certainly didn't want to endure any more
                    hardships. So they played the “Soviet game” sometimes, in our view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our views of the Swedes at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We considered them pretty soft on the Soviet Union. We kept forgetting
                    the Swedish proximity to the USSR. We were not comfortable with the Swedish
                    position; they never joined NATO although they would have been very welcomed.
                    But I think we recognized their dilemma. Nevertheless, we wished that they would
                    have been a little harder and less compliant with the Soviets. We worried that
                    they could not have defended their own security if the Soviets mounted any kind
                    of threat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the political reporting that was being
                        sent in by our embassies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I don't think I can give a good answer to that question. I don't remember
                    any memorable reporting.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We had the national intelligence estimates which we used often. We relied
                    on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the INR-EUR (Bureau of European Affairs)

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I don't remember it being very close. I don't think I talked very often
                    with the desk officers. I am a little vague on specifics, but in general, I
                    don't remember that relationships as being very close.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We were doing our own intelligence analysis on what was going on in each
                    country and where it might be heading.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you travel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: No; it was an “inside” job. In retrospect, I think that that wasn't very
                    good, but as I was still a novice in the Foreign Service, it was a good
                    assignment. I may not have been assertive enough, but I think INR in general was
                    not a central concern to the policy-makers. The bureau was potentially
                    important, but had not reached that level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did INR have a large civil servant component who had been

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Certainly; there were many people who had been in INR for many, many
                    years. I found that those with whom I worked were very good. I didn't have any
                    problems with civil servants which might have been due to the fact that I was
                    not experienced enough. We had a good team and we worked well together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what happened in 1958?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>NELSON: I first went to Finnish language training before that assignment. The
                    plan was that I would eventually be assigned to Finland. Finnish was one of the
                    harder languages for an English speaker. We had a very fine and demanding
                    teacher. There were two of us in the class - Eric Fleisher and I. The teacher
                    said that we would learn the language and lo and behold, we did. The course took
                    about six months. The one saving grace for the language was that it was totally
                    phonetic; you can't go wrong in reading a word. On the other hand, it has
                    something like 20 cases. Furthermore, the spelling of words change depending on
                    the specific usage. Finnish has no prepositions; for us it was a very odd
                    language with a lot of rules. But once you manage the basics, it was a fun
                    language.</p>
                <p>But I was not assigned to Finland right away. Instead, I was assigned to the
                    University of Indiana to study Eastern Europe. By sheer accident, Indiana had a
                    Finnish speaking professor, so that I was able to practice what I had learned at
                    FSI (Foreign Service Institute). In fact, Finland was included in Eastern
                    European studies, although I am sure the Finns would have been very unhappy with
                    that if they had known. It was a well-led department. I had a good experience.
                    But it was also sobering; I did not do very well in the first semester because I
                    was not paying enough attention. I did much better in the second semester. I was
                    very grateful for the academic experience.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the teachers come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: The only one I can remember was a Czech economist. The professor I
                    mentioned earlier with whom I practiced Finnish was a Finn; his English was
                    heavily accented. So I think that most of the staff was from Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1959, you were appointed director for Sweden, Finland
                        and Iceland affairs. Wasn't that an awkward combination - a NATO member, a
                        neutral and a Soviet neighbor? Who handled Norway and Denmark?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: They had their own country director. They were both members of NATO,
                    although Iceland was as well. I am not sure why they split the work that way; it
                    would have been more natural to have three NATO countries in one directorate.
                    But once a division of labor is established, it becomes very difficult to make
                    changes.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>NELSON: It was less of a concern then when we discussed it earlier. I think the
                    Icelanders became resigned to having the Keflavik air force base. I think it is
                    still there. The Icelanders however established very strict rules about leaving
                    the base so that most of our people were essentially confined to the base. That
                    made the assignment more difficult. We were unhappy with the restrictions,
                    although we understood the Icelandic rationale. They didn't want the large
                    American presence to upset their culture.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Sweden during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I think we felt that Sweden was leaning toward the West, but for its own
                    geographical reasons had to appear neutral. But the issue never loomed very
                    large. Swedish neutrality was just an accepted fact of life. Swedish policies
                    did not jeopardize our objectives, and their position was a much lesser concern
                    than it had been years before when the Cold War started. I don't remember us
                    having any major issues with Sweden during my tour on the desk. As I recall, I
                    don't think we worried very much about the Swedes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any Soviet subs prowling around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Yes; in fact there was a Soviet sub in Swedish waters at one point. That
                    was not well received by the Swedes, but we thought it might be quite useful for
                    the Swedes to learn something about how the world worked. In the final analysis,
                    no one was able to determine whether in fact a Soviet sub had been in Swedish
                    waters - it could have been an American one. Unlikely, but it could have
                    happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Finns show any bias toward Soviet positions or
                        were they really neutral?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I don't think they took the Soviet side to the extent they could. I think
                    we had some problems with some of their votes in the UN, but we understood that
                    they had to behave with a certain amount of caution. They still had Soviet
                    troops occupying the Porkkala Peninsula. If a Finn wished to transit this
                    peninsula, he or she had to do it in a closed train car. They also were paying
                    very heavy reparations to the Soviets and were forced to produce certain
                    equipment for the USSR. They certainly could not look forward to a secure
                    future. If a war had broken out between East and West they would have been
                    caught in the middle. This is a situation that lasted for several decades
                    including the time we served in Finland. The occupation of Finnish territory had
                    ceased by that time, but they still had to tread carefully.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Finland was of concern to us during the 1959-61 period. It had a very large
                    communist party - about one-third of the electorate - and any opportunity for
                    Soviet intervention worried us. Of course, we were super-worriers about the
                    communist threat in this period. In retrospect, a lot of our concern looks
                    pretty ridiculous, but at the time, we were worried about events in Finland.</p>
                <p>Finland was receiving assistance from the U.S. During this period, the Finns had
                    an election. The communists made some gains in parliamentary seats. I had just
                    landed on the desk after my year at Indiana University. I was told to attend a
                    conference on the subject of assistance to Eastern Europe, including Finland. I
                    was very surprised by being asked to do this and was totally unprepared. When it
                    came to discuss assistance to Finland, I was asked why assistance should be
                    continued when so many Finns seem to be supporting the communists. There was a
                    question of whether our assistance had not been a colossal failure. I responded,
                    for the lack of anything else to say, that we should just imagine where Finland
                    would be now if there had not been any U.S. assistance. But we terminated the
                    assistance program a couple of years later. Finland in any case did not really
                    meet the criteria for an aid recipient country. But we did worry about Finland,
                    not only in the bureau, but at higher levels as well. It was hard to make the
                    case that assistance was justified when many Finns seemed to be supporting our
                    enemy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were on the desk when Kennedy was elected. How did you
                        view this change in administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We supported it wholeheartedly. The blind fear of communism had been the
                    mantra of previous administrations. Of course, that is easier realized today
                    then it was then. But I think instinctively we thought that it was time for a
                    new look at the world. We thought and hoped that Kennedy might provide that. In
                    fact, there was not that much change, but we had hopes at the beginning of the
                    new administration. So we were quite pleased with the election outcome. It was
                    an unusual reawakening which we had not experienced in the deadly early post-war
                    years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your next assignment in 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I was assigned to Helsinki as political counselor and I was there until
                    1964. It was a natural assignment in light of my Finnish language school three
                    years earlier and my tour on a Scandinavian desk, which handled Finnish
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Finland like in 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>NELSON: It was closely tied to the Soviet Union. It was still paying reparations
                    which accounted in part for their poor standard of living. They worked very hard
                    to meet their obligations they incurred in their peace agreement with the USSR.
                    The Soviets still occupied part of Finland. The Finns suffered great fuel
                    shortages. In the squares of many towns there were mounds of trees that the
                    people could use for heating and cooking. So the Finns were managing, but it
                    certainly was not a comfortable living. Their conditions were improving slowly.
                    It was during our tour that the Soviets began their withdrawal.</p>
                <p>We were very nervous because the Cold War was quite evident. As I said earlier,
                    we were concerned by the close Finland-USSR relationships. In part we did not
                    appreciate that the Finns in fact had not much choice. The president was Urho
                    Kekkonen, who was a very skillful politician. He had grown up on a farm but had
                    found his way into political life. In retrospect, I think he was quite skillful
                    on how he handled the Russians. At the time, he occasionally made us very
                    nervous.</p>
                <p>Internally, the Finns were working very hard to overcome the problems which had
                    been imposed on them. They tried very hard to keep their peace with the
                    Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I think it was Edson Sessions, who had been the deputy postmaster general
                    or something like that. He was replaced in 1961 by Bernard Gufler. Sessions was
                    a decent ambassador. We didn't have a particularly prominent role in
                    Finland.</p>
                <p>Gufler was a career Foreign Service officer. He stayed for about two years when
                    he was replaced by Carl Rowan, who has just passed away. Gufler was not well
                    treated; he was a difficult person, but he was treated rather shabbily by the
                    Department. He learned that he was going to be replaced through the newspapers.
                    That does happen periodically, but it is not the way to run a railroad. He was
                    obviously unhappy and I think he retired after his Helsinki assignment. I did
                    see him later in the Department, but I don't know what he was doing there.</p>
                <p>I learned how to write from Bernard Gufler. I thought I was a pretty good writer,
                    but I learned from him how to communicate well with the Department. I
                    appreciated what he taught me. When I drafted my reports, he would call me in
                    and go over the text with a fine tooth comb, trying to make it more meaningful.
                    He took the time to teach me. I have read some of my reports several years later
                    and I must say that they read well. I could clearly see the Gufler influence. So
                    I was very appreciative of Gufler's teachings.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>He also got me interested in Urho Kekkonen whom I studied and on whom I wrote
                    some good reports. I came to appreciate the difficult path that he was trying to
                    follow. So I had a good relationship with Gufler. He wanted to be “one of the
                    boys.” He started by asking us to address him as “Guf.” You can be sure that
                    didn't happen, except once. We had a press attach� who had too much to drink one
                    day. We were seeing someone off at the airport and he entered the VIP waiting
                    room and said: “Hi there, Guf!” The rest of us just sank in our seats trying to
                    hide. Soon, he became aware of the gaff, but we never let him forget it.</p>
                <p>Then came Carl Rowan, an African-American. He stayed for ten months. It was a
                    very interesting period. I have a very special place in my heart for Carl Rowan.
                    He was a guy who came up the hard way. He had no help from anyone. But he
                    persevered against odds that none of us can really imagine in a period when
                    prejudice against blacks was quite acceptable. He did extraordinarily well. He
                    was very close to LBJ (Lyndon Baines Johnson). He got the Vice President to make
                    a tour of Scandinavia - Sweden, Iceland, Finland and Norway. It utterly
                    exhausted LBJ.</p>
                <p>During the ten months of Rowan's stewardship, we had a fascinating time. The
                    Finns were astounded that we would send a black ambassador. Rowan was both
                    colorful and decent. He was a journalist. I think he came from Tennessee and
                    fought his way up the ladder, against all of the odds that African-Americans
                    faced. We didn't have affirmative action in those days. I am not sure that he
                    would have used that process in any case. I think he would have been more likely
                    to do it his way. He just made the system work for him.</p>
                <p>It was a very active period, with great emphasis on public relations. The LBJ
                    visit was certainly an opportunity for that. The naval attach� in Stockholm had
                    a white Cadillac convertible. Rowan managed to have the car flown to Finland for
                    the Johnson visit. The Finns responded by giving Johnson a ticker-tape parade on
                    the main street in Helsinki! It was a very strange experience. I think it is
                    well known that the Kennedy White House encouraged LBJ's travels and Rowan might
                    have been in cahoots with the White House in pushing this visit; I don't
                    know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you brief Vice President Johnson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Rowan did that. I saw Johnson and worked a lot on the speeches he was to
                    deliver. He had speech writers with him who I thought were awful and wrote
                    inappropriate drafts. We had a hard time getting LBJ to fish in his pocket to
                    get out the right note cards. On some occasions, he did not pull out the right
                    cards. He gave a very bad speech at a sacred graveyard on the Arctic Circle. The
                    Finns first had to fight the Russians and then the Germans who wouldn't leave
                    the country voluntarily. So the graveyard was sacred territory and unfortunately
                    LBJ pulled out the wrong cards giving a speech which had little to do with the
                    surroundings. It did not go over very well.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>LBJ was tired by this time. Lady Bird was with him. She was a magnificent human
                    being. He was petulant and acted like a spoiled brat. He was very difficult to
                    deal with. The Finn press was not very kind to him, despite all our efforts from
                    the control room. He refused to do some things that had been part of the
                    mutually agreed schedule. But Lady Bird filled in behind him; she was great. My
                    wife got along very well with Lady Bird. Rowan would turn to me and ask me to
                    fix something with Mrs. Johnson. My wife did that; we were very lucky that we
                    had Lady Bird's cooperation.</p>
                <p>In general, I think it was a successful trip. The Johnsons were in Finland for
                    three days. He really covered the country in that short a span. One night, while
                    I was in the control room, at about 2 a.m. my wife visited. We lived outside of
                    town on the Baltic; we had four kids. She was clutching a bunch of pillows. I
                    asked her what she was doing. She said she was bringing some pillows for “your
                    God-damned Vice President.” He hadn't liked the pillows that had been provided
                    and somebody knew we had the kind of pillows he liked. So they called our house
                    and asked my wife to bring her pillows, which is what she did. I will never
                    forget that moment.</p>
                <p>LBJ had his Texas steaks and his Cutty Sark whisky - all which came on his plane.
                    He was difficult and petulant. We went to a large city on the Arctic Circle. The
                    Finns put on a show for the American party - a deer roundup and a presentation
                    of the Lapps in their colorful garb. After Johnson returned to Helsinki, I
                    stayed behind to put the pieces all together. The Lapps who had paraded in their
                    costumes and with their sleds, went into the woods and came out in daily wear
                    driving Mercedes to get back home. That was amusing! The National Geographic
                    covered this part of the Vice President's trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that you studied the Finnish president. How did

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I didn't feel as nervous about Kekkonen as Washington did. The Finnish
                    views were not a major preoccupation in the Department, but some people there
                    worried. As I said before, the communist party was pretty strong in Finland - it
                    had about 1/3 of the vote. That party was headed by the daughter of a former
                    member of the Soviet Politburo. He had stayed on the Politburo until his death.
                    So if someone worried about communist parties, the Finnish one posed a
                    challenge. It must be said that Finns are all nationalist and that went for the
                    communists as well. They, however, fully supported the Soviet Union unless it
                    threatened Finnish independence. They supported Moscow even though Stalin and
                    his successors understood that the Soviets could have Finland whenever they
                    wanted. They tried at a very heavy price - The Winter War - but they pretty much
                    controlled the country. There is a play entitled The Unknown Soldier which
                    depicted the situation pretty well. Our oldest son went to Finnish school and
                    that was his favorite play. I might note that he was the head of his Finnish
                    class even though this was his first foreign language.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>In that play, the troops have some political arguments. It made quite clear that
                    the Finnish communists are first of all very nationalistic, although there were
                    times when this position put them in very difficult straits caught between their
                    compatriots and the Soviets. They had to fight the Soviets and still maintain
                    their loyalty to the communist cause. This periodic dilemma made it interesting
                    to watch the Finnish communists. I must say that the party chief was a very
                    strong person and very articulate. We had a little contact with her; not very
                    much. I met with her on a couple of occasions. She was very effective on the
                    floor of parliament. She was tolerated by her Finnish colleagues who appreciated
                    her skills and intellect, even if they did not agree with her views. In
                    retrospect, I probably should have been more active in meeting with her, even
                    though my masters might well have been very unhappy if I had done so. Throughout
                    the world, we were not communicating with communists. That probably was a very
                    short sighted policy.</p>
                <p>I remember that I used to drive the North Korean representatives in Helsinki
                    nuts. I would go over to them and try to shake hands with them and they would
                    run away as fast as they could. They didn't know what to do. Of course, I was
                    also breaching protocol to some extent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, you would not have been sent back to North
                        Korea. Were we looking for potential splits between the Finnish communists
                        and the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I don't think we were sufficiently sophisticated to undertake such a
                    mission. I think in general our view was that the party was going to follow the
                    directives of the Politburo regardless of any other points of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were our contacts with Kekkonen and how did he manage
                        the East-West conflict?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: His view was that Finland's most important relationship by far was with
                    the Soviet Union. He didn't want to upset the West, but he was not going to
                    spend sleepless nights worrying about our views. His first priority was to keep
                    the Soviets happy. There was one incident when I was in Sweden. Kekkonen was
                    summoned to the Kremlin, and he went in a hurry. That bothered us a lot. He
                    struck some kind of agreement which did not sit too well with us. But the
                    Soviets had the right, as I indicated earlier, under the peace agreement to take
                    over the country or parts of it. Kekkonen of course did everything he could to
                    prevent such Soviet action. Eventually, he hoped they would leave all Finnish
                    territory, which eventually they did because no purpose was being served by a
                    continuing occupation.</p>
                <p>Kekkonen would have liked to be friends with the West but could not jeopardize
                    relations with the Soviets. He was very realistic about Finland's situation and
                    could not forget that Finland had been part of Russia at one stage in its
                    history.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I remember, this was a very tense period during which
                        the Berlin Wall was built and the Cuban missile crisis in October, 1962. Did
                        we try to use these events to sway the Finns towards us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We just watched. We did not have a pro-active policy vis-a-vis the Finns.
                    I think we all understood their situation and thought that any efforts to move
                    Finland from its pro-Soviet stance was bound to fail. Our ambassadors talked to
                    Kekkonen on a number of occasions. He was always available for them, but no
                    argument that we presented could sway him from his course. I think the Finns did
                    become quite anxious about these developments which just heightened East-West
                    tensions. There was some concern about nuclear fall out hitting our residences.
                    I can remember storing water in our basement and trying to seal our windows. We
                    were down wind from the Soviet Union and felt threatened about nuclear debris
                    being blown our way. The Soviets were testing their bombs in the Arctic Sea not
                    too far away, which did produce some fall out over Finland.</p>
                <p>Our diplomatic efforts were essentially limited to staying in touch with the
                    Finns. The Soviets were also very active. At one time, they tried to subvert my
                    wife. They thought they saw a relationship developing between one of their
                    agents and my wife. They tried to take advantage of that, but they didn't get
                    very far. My wife spotted their efforts right away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As political counselor, how did you deal with your
                        counterparts in the Foreign Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: There was nothing unusual about that relationship. It was close. We used
                    to have very open and frank discussions. They were very clear on their difficult
                    geopolitical situation. We used to have very open discussions after I
                    established their trust, which in Scandinavia takes some time. I should note
                    that the Finns do not like being considered as Scandinavians. I think we had
                    good relationships. They were very accessible, and our conversations were never
                    tense. I had very good relationships with the members of the second tier
                    leadership of the Conservative, Social Democratic and Agrarian Parties. I
                    sometimes even had meetings with the leadership of these parties. Again, these
                    were very open relationships which led to good conversations. So our ability to
                    communicate with the bureaucracy and the politicians was very good, but always
                    circumscribed by the reality of the Finnish situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The elections were western-style?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>NELSON: Absolutely. In fact, their electoral process was one of the things that
                    made the Finns nervous. Except for the conservatives, the electorate in general
                    did not want to see an increase of parliamentary seats occupied by the
                    conservatives because they were concerned that the Soviets might get upset. The
                    Finns would have preferred a smaller representation from the communists, but not
                    to the level that might have made the Soviets nervous. There were nuances like
                    that in the elections, but they were fairly conducted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your social contacts, did you notice any interest in
                        changing the external political situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I think most of the Finns looked forward to the day when they would not
                    have to always worry about the Soviets. They had broken loose before and hoped
                    to able to do it again. Many, especially the conservatives, would have preferred
                    a policy which would have distanced Finland from the USSR. They thought that
                    Finland had been much too much subservient to the Soviets. The social-democrats
                    were very disliked by the Soviets because they were a leftist alternative to the
                    communists which made them very attractive to the Finns. So I think, except for
                    the conservatives and some of the Social-Democratic leadership, most of the
                    Finns were resigned to their relationships with the Soviets. They all wanted to
                    keep as much independence as they could, but understood the limitations. I think
                    they understood their situation far better than we did.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I can't remember that we had much response. I don't think our reporting
                    was a problem, even at the political levels which might have tended to be more
                    ideological. I mention the episode that took place before I left Washington when
                    I had to attend a meeting on whether assistance should be continued to Finland
                    in light of the strong support for the communist party. That is the only policy
                    issue that arose on Finland in my several years of dealing with the country,
                    both in Washington and in Helsinki.</p>

                    think in retrospect that really wasn't very good but we were still pretty green
                    in the business and probably not assertive enough. We were on the fringes still
                    of what was happening. It was potentially important but not really at the
                    beginning.</p>

                    problems with them and that may have been a product of the fact I wasn't

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Oh yeah, no it was quite a new experience. We had a very fine, very
                    demanding teacher. There were two of us in the class, Eric Fleicher and I. She
                    was very good and she said you are going to learn Finnish and we, by George, we
                    did. Her name was Tanler.</p>
                <p>Then the difficulty there was we had months of this language, five, six months
                    concentrated in the FSI system. A very unusual language. One saving grace is
                    it's 100 percent phonetic so you can't go wrong at reading a word. The other is
                    it's got twenty cases, something like that, and then words are changed in their
                    spelling depending on how you're using it. They had no prepositions, a lot of
                    odd things but quite a fun language, a phonetic language with a thousand rules,
                    but it was learnable. But I wasn't assigned to Finland right away, I eventually
                    did go to Finland but didn't go right away. I must have done the Finnish before
                    I went to university because I picked up with a Finnish professor, a Finnish
                    language professor there and carried on to keep it current while doing Eastern
                    European studies. Then I went back and I must have gone to the bureau.</p>

                <p>NELSON: Yes they included Finland and again it's not a very happy classification
                    from the Finns point of view but no that's where they put the Finns, they had no
                    where else to put them. It was a very good department, very well lead and I
                    cannot remember the professor's name.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: So it was a very good experience. It also was a comeuppance because I had
                    been getting a little bit cocky and my first semester I didn't do well because I
                    wasn't paying enough attention. But I picked it up after that and very grateful
                    for the experience I must say.</p>

                <p>NELSON: The only one I can remember who was an economist, I do not remember his
                    name and he was a Czech. The Finnish fellow was a Finn and he had a heavy accent
                    so he hadn't been there very long I guess. I think they were mainly Eastern
                    Europeans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you became country director for Sweden, Finland and
                        Iceland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you did that from '59-'61. It's sort of an odd
                        combination in a way. You've got a NATO, a neutral and kind of a Soviet
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to Norway and to Denmark in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: They had an office of their own. They were members of ________.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Except for, of course, Iceland being the odd man out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: That's right. But that is strange and it just struck me at the time and
                    I'm not quite sure why that was but that was the way it had fallen out. You know
                    when these things get established and so people forget what were the reasons for
                    establishing it that way. They don't know that and they just carry on as they
                    did before.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Iceland first. Was Iceland still a
                        concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Finland was less of a concern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We learned to live with it or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Oh yeah, sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Icelanders learned to live with us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I think that was probably the bigger thing because we had that big
                    Keflavik base. I don't know if we still have it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we do but...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: They established, I think during that period, very restrictive rules
                    about movement of our people. We were pretty well confined to Keflavik so life
                    became a little bit more difficult for people at that time and we were unhappy
                    about that but I think understanding at the same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Icelanders just didn't want the impact of so many
                        Americans to really upset their culture and they are absolutely right, sure.
                        You didn't get involved in the cod wars or anything? Was that going on or
                        did that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: No that was later. We didn't get into that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Sweden? I mean was Sweden trying to play both
                        sides or was it understood that they were kind of on our side but didn't
                        want to make too much about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Oh I think you described it pretty well. It was hardly a blip on the
                    screen though. By then I don't think we understood their situation. They seemed
                    pretty solid and less of a worry than they had been a few years before while we
                    were getting this Cold War underway. I think we were pretty comfortable with
                    them. There was nothing very big about Sweden during my time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any sort of Soviet subs prowling around?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>NELSON: Yeah at that time there was a Soviet sub in Swedish waters at one point,
                    I know that was, I think it was during my time and that was very upsetting to
                    the Swedes and we thought that was probably a good experience for them. We never
                    really determined whether it was a Swedish sub, who knows? I think we were not
                    worried about the Swedes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we cooperating at all as sort of helping the Swedes
                        upgrade their military? I mean on the side or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I can't remember if we were, I'm afraid I just don't know the answer to
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about dealing because I imagine you were talking to
                        the Finnish Embassy and all, were they carrying the water for the Soviet
                        Union or pretty much doing their own thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Oh I don't think they were. They certainly would have avoided carrying
                    the water for the Soviets to the extent that they could. I think that we had
                    some problems with some of their votes in the UN so they had to behave with a
                    certain amount of caution. They still had Soviet troops occupying the Porkkala
                    peninsula and whenever Finns wanted to go through there they had to go through
                    and shudder their railroad cars and that kind of thing and they were paying very
                    heavy reparations and having to produce things for the Soviets. Their future was
                    kind of uncertain should things get bad and we go to war of some kind or other.
                    In that sense the situation had prevailed for many years including during the
                    time that we were assigned there although the occupation of Porkkala had been
                    removed by then.</p>
                <p>I think the Finns were a concern. They had a big Communist Party and any gain by
                    the Soviets or any foothold by the Soviets worried us because we were super
                    worriers about the Communist threat. Looking back now live it looks pretty
                    ridiculous but we were very, very worried.</p>
                <p>One of the things that came up during that time was we had a Finnish election.
                    Finland was an AID recipient from the United States and the Communists gained a
                    seat or two maybe more, three or four, a fairly good sized party; about a third
                    elected which held between 25 and 30 percent, was that way years later. I was a
                    pretty new kid in town, fresh from the University of Indiana and I was told to
                    go over to this hearing that was being held somewhere in town. I've forgotten
                    who was in the chair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were congressional hearings?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>NELSON: It was a departmental thing I think and there may have been some
                    congressional presence. It may have been under the auspices of AID itself, I
                    just don't remember. But, in any event, I was very surprised by this and totally
                    unprepared; it was a hearing on other countries too in Eastern Europe. They came
                    to Finland and the AID program in Finland and they asked me, “Well now Mr.
                    Nelson, we give all this aid to the Finns and then they go to the polls and they
                    elect all these other Communists, more Communists than they had before we
                    started giving them aid. So what'll we do? I mean it just looks like a colossal
                    failure.”</p>
                <p>Well the only thing I could think to say was, “Well Sir, think of what it would
                    have been like if we hadn't given them any aid.” How many more Communists would
                    have been elected. We ended our AID program with Finland; they were not a proper
                    recipient anyway. They hadn't been for a couple of years.</p>
                <p>So it was a worry and it worried people at the higher political levels that we
                    were helping them out in someway and then they go elect more Communists than
                    they had before, that's not good stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. Well we had the same problem with Italy too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Oh God yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the election of President
                        Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that, particularly at the beginning, how did you
                        view it sort of personally and maybe some of your colleagues view this
                        change in administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Oh I think we were very much a very positive response to it. We had been
                    pretty blindly stuck in the mud on this fear of the Communists. It's easier to
                    say now than it was then and so I'm not sure. But I think instinctively we were
                    feeling that we needed to take a fresh and renewed look and that Kennedy could
                    provide that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: In reality, of course, he didn't provide all that much change but we
                    thought it would.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thought it would.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: So no, I think we were quite pleased with this and it was sort of an
                    unusual reawakening which we hadn't experienced in a sort of deadly post war,
                    early post war years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I think this might be a good place to stop now and
                        I'll put at the end of the tape where we are. So we are coming up to you
                        when you went to Finland as political counselor for 1961-'64. So we'll pick
                        this up in 1961 when you're off to Finland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: OK, very good</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great, great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Very good, that is fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 11th of October 2000. Harvey, you were in
                        Finland from '61-'64. Was that just a regular assignment or was there any
                        logic behind it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Well I suppose the Scandinavian background and they had been looking for
                    a volunteer to take Finnish language about three years earlier. There were two
                    volunteers, a fellow by the name of Eric Youngquist and I. So we both took that
                    course and actually as things go in our business, of course, we weren't assigned
                    there for a while and it began to look like I might not be. Eventually happily,
                    we were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Finland like when you arrived in 1961? How did it
                        set both internally and sort of in the external world?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>NELSON: Well it was very tied in with the Soviets, it was still paying
                    reparations, it was still very poor, and they were working very hard on meeting
                    their obligations under the peace agreement that they made with the Russians.
                    The Russians were still in occupation of the Porkkala Peninsula, which meant
                    when you took the train across southern Finland you had to go through this and
                    they put blinders on the railroad cars; you couldn't drive through but you could
                    take the train through but you couldn't look out. It was a very, very strange
                    situation and the reparations there were big fuel shortages; there were still
                    piles of trees in the squares for people for their heating purposes, they didn't
                    have gas and oil or that sort of thing so it was pretty. They were managing but
                    it was pretty poverty stricken sort of situation out of which they were climbing
                    and with great effect. Of course in the ensuing years, and it was beginning in
                    our time, the Russians were beginning to withdraw. We were very nervous because
                    it was in the early days of the Cold War and we didn't like their close
                    connections with the Russians. I'm afraid often we didn't understand that they
                    really didn't have much choice. They had a president named Urho Kekkonen who was
                    a very skillful politician. He had grown up as a farm boy but learned his way
                    into politics somehow and was really pretty skillful, in retrospect, in dealing
                    with the Russians although he made us very nervous at times.</p>
                <p>So I think from an international point of view we were edgy about Finland's
                    relationship with the Russians. Internally they were just working real hard to
                    deal with their problems and try to keep the peace with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, who was our ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I was just thinking now who was our ambassador when I went there. I'm not
                    sure of the order of things but it must have been Edson Sessions who had been, I
                    believe, former deputy post master general or some such position. Anyway, he was
                    a political appointee and he was there for some months before he was replaced or
                    retired. I have forgotten exactly what happened there. He was a perfectly decent
                    ambassador. He was replaced by Bernard Gufler who was a career Foreign Service
                    officer. But he didn't stay very long only about a year or so, well maybe a
                    little bit more than a year. I think I've got the order of things right. I think
                    it was Bernard Gufler; he was replaced by Carl Rowan who incidentally died about
                    a week ago. One of the sad things was the way Gufler was treated. He was a
                    difficult person but he learned about his replacement by reading the newspaper.
                    It's a kind of a sad thing; it does happen in our business but he hadn't been
                    informed so that made him pretty unhappy. I think that was the end, I think that
                    was his last assignment. I did meet him once later in the Department but I'm not
                    sure what he was doing at that point.</p>
                <p>One of the things I learned from Bernard Gufler was how to write. I'd fancy
                    myself a pretty good writer and I guess I was but I learned some of the
                    real...to write very usefully and communicate well and I appreciated that very
                    much.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go through the learning process, what did you
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Well I was doing my reports and he had me on the carpet and said, “How
                    are you supposed to understand this and you can make it much clearer if you did
                    that.” He took the time and I read some of my stuff since then, in recent years,
                    and it's pretty good but I consider it the Gufler influence. So I was very
                    appreciative of that experience. I did some very good studies of Urho Kekkonen
                    with his encouragement and gave it some understanding of the man and what he
                    thought he was facing. So that was a good relationship. Gufler, he wanted to be
                    one of the boys and he came in telling us to call him Guf. You can bet that
                    didn't happen except once. We had a press attach� and he got a little too much
                    to drink one day and they were seeing somebody off at the airport and he came in
                    the room and said, “Hi ya Guf!” The rest of us just sank out of sight and, of
                    course, he realized what he had done at that point as he really wasn't all that
                    far-gone. So he had a hard time living that one down.</p>
                <p>Then we got Carl Rowan and Carl Rowan stayed for ten months. It was a very
                    interesting time. I have a very important place in my heart for Carl Rowan. He's
                    a guy who came up the hard way, nobody helped him, he fought the awful battle,
                    he fought odds in ways you and I wouldn't understand because he's a black man
                    and it's just not possible to know it from his position, but he did
                    extraordinarily well. He was very close to LBJ (Lyndon Baines Johnson).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about President Johnson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Yes, Vice President Johnson at that time. He was so close to him that he
                    got Vice President Johnson to do a Scandinavian tour. He did it all, he did
                    Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Norway, he was utterly exhausted the poor man. But
                    during that ten months we had a whirlwind of a time because it fascinated the
                    Finns that we would send a black ambassador, a very colorful and very decent
                    man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Rowan's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: He was a journalist. He came from Tennessee, I think. He fought his way
                    against all the odds that black people faced particularly then. We didn't have
                    affirmative action and all that stuff and he wouldn't have put up with it
                    anyway. He would have done it his own way. He just made it work for him, made
                    the system work for him. So it was a sort of colorful, very active, sometimes
                    sort of uncertain time, really a big PR time (public relations) especially with
                    ending up with this visit by Lyndon Baines Johnson. The Naval attach� in
                    Stockholm had a white Cadillac convertible and he organized to have that darn
                    car flown over to Finland for the Johnson visit. He had a ticker tape parade on
                    the main street. It really was a very strange experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While we're are talking about it, could you talk a little
                        about Johnson because some of these trips I think the Kennedy White House
                        tried to keep Johnson out and Scandinavia sounds like a place where you
                        could put him where he's not going to do too much trouble and they are kind
                        of happy to have him away. I mean there wasn't much love lost.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: It may well have been. That may have made it possible, but I know Rowan
                    made a big thing. I think, I may be wrong but sort of instigated this and maybe
                    he was in cahoots with the White House, I don't know. But he made everything
                    possible we could do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you brief the Vice President?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I didn't, Carl Rowan did. I saw him; I worked a lot on his speeches and
                    things. He had speechwriters with him who were awful and inappropriate. We had a
                    hard time getting him to reach into the right pocket for the right set of cards,
                    his speech notes and many times we lost. We had one or two, well one, a very bad
                    speech that was given at a sacred graveyard up in Rovaniemi, up in the Arctic
                    Circle. The Finns are still fighting over the war. First they had to fight the
                    Russians and then the Germans wouldn't leave so they had to drive them out of
                    there and going to war against Germany. So there were a lot of deep-seated
                    feelings about all this and Johnson didn't do well there because he reached in
                    the wrong pocket and read the wrong speech from our point of view. But he was
                    tired and his wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lady Bird.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Lady Bird, Lady Bird was there. What a magnificent woman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everyone who has dealt with her has said she is just a
                        delight.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: But he was petulant, he was a spoiled kid. He gave us a difficult time.
                    His press wasn't all that good and we stayed up all night in the control room
                    and prepared all his stuff for one of his aides to read him the awful results of
                    the news coverage. He refused to do something that he had originally agreed to
                    but Lady Bird filled in behind him beautifully. God she was great. My wife Siley
                    Ann hit it off very well with Lady Bird and Carl Rowan would say, “Ok, Sam would
                    you go fix that with Mrs. Johnson?” “Who me?” Well she went and fixed it and the
                    two of them worked. So it was generally a successful trip.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>One night I was in the control room, it was about two o'clock in the morning
                    roughly and in comes, we lived out on the outskirts of town on the Baltic, on
                    the edge of the Baltic. We had four kids what have you, and in comes my wife
                    clutching a bunch of pillows. I said, “What are you doing here at this hour?”
                    She said, “I'm bringing some pillows to your God damn vice president.” He didn't
                    like the pillows anyway and somebody knew that we had down pillows or something
                    and so “Get Siley Ann, she'll bring in the pillows”. So she did. I'll never
                    forget. That was the phrase, “God damn vice president.”</p>
                <p>Well anyway, he had his Texas steaks and his Cutty Sark whiskey all with him. He
                    wasn't bad but he was petulant, he was difficult. We went to Rovaniemi, which is
                    the main town north on the Arctic Circle and they had a big Laplander show and
                    they showed him reindeer roundup and stuff and the Laps in their garb and what
                    have you. That was an interesting thing because after the vice president left,
                    we went back to Helsinki. I was there sort of putting everything back and pieces
                    were put back together. Finally these Lap little guys and all these furs and
                    things and they had been lassoing and riding reindeer, hitching up sleds and
                    what have you they went into the woods and they came out to drive home in their
                    Mercedes. That was kind of a cute thing and the National Geographic did cover
                    that part of the trip actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk a bit about the study you did about
                        Kekkonen. At that time how did you read him vis-a-vis the East and the
                        West.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Well, I suppose how they officially and I suppose I absorbed that. I
                    didn't feel as nervous about him as I think people in Washington felt about him.
                    And sure this is not a big blip on our radar scan. The Communist Party was
                    pretty strong in Finland; they had about 25 billion percent of their vote.
                    Hertta Kuusinen was the leader of the Finnish Communist Party and her father, I
                    can't remember his name, Kuusinen, of course, but he was a survivor in the
                    Politburo, he lasted all the way up until he died, he held out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the Soviet Politburo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: The Soviet, that's right but he was a member of the Soviet Politburo. He
                    had gone over to those guys in spite of their revolution and his daughter was
                    ahead of the Finnish Communist Party. So if you're worried about Communists
                    there are grounds to worry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were not national Communists these were Soviet
                        Communists?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>NELSON: These were Nationalists, the Finns are nationalists. The Finnish
                    Communists were very nationalistic, very Finnish nationalistic but it was hard
                    for the Soviet Union to do anything wrong in their point of view even though
                    Stalin and his friends had made a deal with the Russians that said that the
                    Russians could have Finland if they wanted. The Russians did take a stab at
                    that, it cost them but they got control of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Winter War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: The Winter War, that's right. There is a play called The Unknown Soldier,
                    and this depicts the situation, I think, pretty well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A movie was made of that too. I think I saw that, a
                        Finnish movie.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: This is when my oldest son went to Finnish school and that was his
                    favorite book. He was head of his class in Finnish. Finnish was his first
                    language at school.</p>
                <p>But in that play there are arguments, political arguments, among the troops. The
                    Finnish Communists are very Finnish, not Russian, not Soviet, not what's another
                    term for the Russians, but they were very conflicted. It was very hard for them;
                    they had to fight the Soviets at the same time being Communists. But there was
                    an interesting feeling with that kind of problem maybe inner conflicts for those
                    guys.</p>
                <p>I must say Hertta Kuusinen was an extraordinarily able person and very, very
                    articulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have contact with her?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Yes we had a little, not much. I had some political contact with her. She
                    was very effective on the floor and very tolerated by her Finnish colleagues.
                    They appreciate her skill, her intellect, being strong. But I didn't, if I had
                    it to do over again I would have done more to get close to her but I think that
                    would have made my masters very unhappy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well I was just going to say this was not a time when
                        there was an awful lot of sort of relaxation. I mean in Italy, well almost
                        around the world, we really weren't talking to the Communists unless it was
                        in a country like the Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: No and I think that was kind of stupid. I remember I used to drive the
                    North Koreans in Finland nuts because I'd go over there and kind of shake hands
                    with them and they'd run like hell. They didn't know what to do. It was terribly
                    wrong.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't supposed to either, but you weren't going to
                        be sent back to North Korea. Were we looking for signs in the Finnish
                        Communist Party of differences? Were we looking for perhaps the embryonic
                        ketoism or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I don't think we were that sophisticated about the Finnish Communists. I
                    think the general conclusion was that Hertta Kuusinen was her father's daughter
                    and she's got things in control and whatever the Politburo said they'll do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well back to the president. What were our contacts with
                        him and how did he play the Soviet west situation during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: His view was the most important relationship Kekkonen had by far is that
                    of the Soviet Union. He didn't want to upset the rest of [inaudible], if you
                    were going to worry about it, it was more important to deal with and keep the
                    Soviets happy. I had forgotten some incident occurred and I should remember
                    this, as it mattered at the time.</p>
                <p>I was in Sweden at the time that this thing happened. I've forgotten what it was
                    but anyway Urho Kekkonen was summoned to the Kremlin and he went without
                    argument and that bothered us a lot. He made some sort of arrangement, but the
                    details of the deal struck at that time I'm just am not sure because the
                    Russians had the right under their peace agreement to reoccupy some areas I've
                    forgotten and Urho's objective was to avoid this kind of thing and also
                    eventually get them to leave Porkkala, which eventually they did because it
                    wasn't serving them. So to him he would like to be friends with everybody but
                    all that would be sacrificed to keep the Russians at arms length if at all
                    possible. He was very realistic; these guys were right next-door.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well they had been part of Russia at one part.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Oh they had been yes, sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this was a very tense time. There are two major things
                        that happened that I recall. One was the erection of the Berlin Wall, which
                        got rather tense and then the Cuban missile crisis in October of '62. How
                        did these things play? Were we trying to do anything or were we just
                        watching really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: You mean in Finland?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We didn't try to do anything with the Finns. I think there is enough
                    realism involved. I mean Kekkonen made it clear, in fact instinctively, it was
                    not my job to do. So we talked with them, I mean the ambassador did. He was
                    always available, very accessible guy but he always got the same answer that we
                    didn't want to hear. No, I think that the Finns became quite anxious and we did
                    have the rudiments of residential defense against nuclear fall out and this kind
                    of thing. We were storing water in our basement and finding ways to seal windows
                    and we were down wind from the Russians. We did do some things, but as far as
                    our relationship with Finland we just sort of kept in touch as close as we
                    could.</p>
                <p>The Russians tried to subvert my wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Well they tried to. They thought they saw a relationship developing
                    between one of their number and my wife and they tried to take advantage of
                    that. It didn't work but my wife spotted it right away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your position was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Political counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did you deal with your counterparts in the ministry
                        of foreign affairs, the Finnish ministry of foreign affairs?</hi>

                <p>NELSON: Well in the usual way, we had very good relationships with them. We had a
                    very good open discussion they were very open folks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean would they at a certain point would they sit down
                        and say, “Hi, you know what our position is here. You don't have the Soviet
                        bear sitting across the border and you don't expect us to do this or that.”
                        Or did they sort of spout kind of the party line?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>NELSON: No, no you are exactly right. They were very open on this and the
                    discussion was very good with them. They didn't have any problem with that. It
                    took a while; it took quite a while to establish trust with the Scandinavian
                    types. But the Finns hate to be called Scandinavians, but they are in that part
                    of the world. No, the relationship was very good, very accessible, not tense or
                    anything like that that. We could say pretty much what one wanted to. They
                    likewise. I mean this was true. I had a lot of relationships with the secondary
                    level of the Conservative Social Democratic Agrarian Parties, which made up the
                    bigger chunk of the Parliament. We had very good relationships and sometimes
                    occasionally we talked to the leadership.</p>
                <p>Again, it was a pretty open relationship and very satisfactory from their point
                    of view but you know accepting reality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now with the political parties there, I mean, were
                        there two elections and was this...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Oh absolutely, two elections. This is one of the things that made the
                    Finns nervous. One of things was they didn't want to see, except for the
                    Conservatives, they didn't want to see an increase in Conservative seats because
                    that would make the Russians nervous, they didn't want that. They'd like to see
                    a little bit of diminution of the Communist members in the Parliament but not
                    very much because then the Russians knew. There were nuances but often it was
                    quite often elected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean, nuances are great but when you get around to
                        voting; what was your sounding of people you meet socially and all this?
                        Obviously they were aware of the situation, but did they have any hope of
                        breaking loose at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Oh, they looked to the day when they could, yes. They had broken loose
                    before and they hoped to do it again. They had hopes but they realized, I think,
                    most of them, not all of them, that they ought to stand up more strongly to the
                    Russians, they shouldn't be so kowtowing as we have been and that kind of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>The Social Democrats were very disliked by the Russians because they were a
                    leftist alternative and that's were a lot of Finns would like to go. So this
                    affected the attitude of these folks. I think in general the idea was let's
                    accept the Conservative side and some of the Social Democratic leadership, let's
                    not upset the Russians for God's sakes, that is the worse thing to do. But you
                    have to keep as much as you can. In that respect they do a lot better than we
                    do.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find in our reporting that we were having a
                        problem. This didn't rank very high on the American international radar but
                        sometimes you have a problem reporting where you're dealing with people who
                        are dealing with a tremendous problem in very practical terms but when it
                        gets kicked back to Washington, particularly when it moves up into the
                        political field, it gets almost ideological. I mean people say either you're
                        with us or against us or something like that. Was that a problem for you
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I can't remember that it was. I suppose it must have been. Before I went
                    to Finland I was in the Northern European bureau and one of my responsibilities
                    was to, having never been there of course, and I was sent off completely blind,
                    very naive to some hearing in which featured the director of AID I think or
                    something like that but I was caught completely in flap. I had no idea what this
                    was about, would I just go to this meeting. Well I went and I thought just go
                    and watch and listen to this and report back. No, no I was to be a witness. I
                    was totally unprepared for what I knew. There had been an election in Finland
                    and the Communists had gained three seats and at that time we had and AID
                    program prepared, folks with AID a little bit of a fall out from the Marshall
                    Plan even though the Finns didn't join it in Western Europe. The director said
                    to me, “Mr. Nelson we put all this money into Finland and what happened? The
                    Communist Party increased six fold.” All I could think of was, “Well Sir, think
                    what the vote would have been like if we hadn't given them any money at all.” He
                    had to leave it at that as it answered the question. So, things like that were
                    happening but I can't recall anything in the fall out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have an expert on tribes in the political
                        section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: No; I suppose we should have, but it would have been a daunting task
                    because there were about 200 languages in the Congo. Tribalism was a terrible
                    problem in Africa, especially in the Congo. I did have some good meetings with
                    tribal representatives when they would gather together. The issue is a very
                    delicate one. They don't like to talk about it. They don't like to be accused of
                    tribalism, but indeed that is their society. We did discuss the problem of all
                    of the various languages in the Congo and the barriers that this created to
                    bringing the country together. We did discuss the necessity for a country to
                    have one language if it is be at all governed. They had adopted French as that
                    one common language, but that was a foreign language which had no relationship
                    to their cultures. That was the only solution to the language problem.</p>

                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>NELSON: I can't really remember. I am sure he favored his tribesmen; that was the
                    only way for him to have some peace of mind. But I don't think his tribe took
                    over as much power as the leading tribe in Kenya did, for example. The standard
                    approach was that one tribesman could not trust members of another tribe.
                    According to local customs, your house doors were suppose to be opened to any
                    one, but that does not mean that you could trust him.</p>

                        which at the time was the capital of a completely Marxist country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: At least, so it proclaimed. Some proclaim their loyalty to Marx to this
                    day, but it is mostly a hollow statement. The relationships between the two
                    Congos was not good. The ferry traffic between the two countries was stopped
                    because they were concerned about infiltrators. That may have been a legitimate
                    concern. On occasions, there used to be an exchange of gun-fire across the
                    river. But this situation resulted in a very profitable smuggling trade.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we still have relations with Congo-Brazzaville? Did

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I think we severed them in 1965. We had a telephone line and a radio
                    connection with Brazzaville, and we used them periodically. That was useful at
                    times, particularly to our folk in Brazzaville who felt very beleaguered. When
                    we did break relationships, I thought it was a great idea. It saved all the
                    costs of keeping that embassy going. But then the U.S. couldn't wait to open it
                    again. I could never understand that. Why would we wish to have representation
                    in Brazzaville?</p>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>NELSON: I am not sure that after two years and a day there, that I really cared.
                    It was an interesting experience. I think that as in the case of most, if not
                    all, Foreign Service people, by the time I left Leopoldville, I was really
                    focusing on my next assignment. Sometimes one feels desperate about leaving his
                    or her present assignment.</p>

                <p>NELSON: I didn't feel surrounded by Africanists. The embassy people came from
                    everywhere and many would go outside of Africa in their next assignments. I
                    think by 1967, the optimistic view of Africa's future was fading and people were
                    beginning to look at our assistance levels. On the other hand, Africa was one of
                    the few geographical areas where we had not been the guilty party.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I was assigned to Gabon as DCM. We went on home leave and then to
                    Libreville.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that you were being made into an
                        Africanist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: It never occurred to me. My attitude was that as a Foreign Service
                    officer, I went where I was told. It is so different today! But then, that was
                    the way you behaved. I was a little concerned by the Gabon assignment because we
                    didn't know what we could do about the kids and school. There had been a good
                    international school in Leopoldville. Originally it had been a Methodist or
                    Baptist school, but by mid-1960 it was essentially non-sectarian. It was a
                    pretty good school. Our kids learned French pretty well. But the education in
                    Gabon would be a different situation and that bothered us a little. We didn't
                    know what problems we might have to face. But later on, we found out what we had
                    to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Gabon from 1967 to late 1969. Who was our
                        ambassador? How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: David Bane. His wife's name was Patty. Bane had been mainly in the Asian
                    sub-continent. He was in Pakistan as consul general. He learned to play polo. He
                    was a prince of a man. Patty was delightful. The embassy was very, very small;
                    that was great and I loved it. The embassy was quartered in an old bank
                    building, which had a huge iron-grilled work for a door. It weighed a ton but
                    could be opened by a little key inserted into a tiny lock. Anyone with a little
                    strength could have opened that door. But every morning we would unlock the door
                    and every evening we would lock it, even though we recognized the weakness of
                    the door.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Gabon was an interesting and fun assignment. It is a tiny country of
                    approximately a million people. It was not terribly important to us. But it was
                    a great place for the kids. The environment was very secure as contrasted to the
                    Congo where life was very dangerous. I think if the Department were to do it all
                    over again, it might not have assigned officers with families to the Congo. The
                    problems there were corrupt soldiers and policemen, who would stop you on the
                    street and demand money. The population was very restive. Every time there was a
                    automobile accident some one else got killed. It was bad situation, but we went
                    there blindly and learned to cope with the problems of Leopoldville.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Gabon like in the late 1960s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: It was a country of major French influence. The president was Omar Bongo.
                    The country had oil and wood resources. Very fine plywood came from Gabon. There
                    is also a huge iron mine owned by U.S. Steel or another American company. That
                    mine is way back in the jungle which made it rather inaccessible. There were
                    plans to build a railroad from there to a port, which I think has been built by
                    now. So oil, wood and iron were the major sources for income.</p>
                <p>There was a small French colonial community - people who had lived in Gabon
                    before it achieved independence. They were a delightful group. Also there were a
                    few people from other former French colonies - Cambodia, Vietnam, Senegal etc. I
                    think there were five members of the diplomatic corps - the Chinese, the
                    Germans, the Israelis, the French and us. So it was a small diplomatic corps.
                    There were in addition countries that were accredited to Gabon but whose
                    representatives lived elsewhere and only visited Libreville.</p>
                <p>Gabon was quiet and peaceful and as I said, very secure. There was no diplomatic
                    enclave. We all lived in the city. So we had all kinds of neighbors. Our closest
                    neighbors were from Vietnam; our youngest son developed a great relationship
                    with the young Vietnamese. They were great explorers, so these kids wandered off
                    into the city streets, but we never worried about that. It was fantastic. My
                    wife once had her bicycle stolen; she reported to the police which caused an
                    interesting episode. She had to fill out a massive number of forms, but the
                    bicycle was never found. That was our only incident in over two years.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>We first sent the children to local schools. That lasted only briefly because the
                    children did not know French well enough to keep up with the lessons. The public
                    schools were very undisciplined, so we tried Catholic schools. They were almost
                    as bad; so we finally decided to teach the kids at home - the Calvert system.
                    That was very successful because two of our officers had wives who were
                    accredited teachers. Foreign Service officers were eligible for a 25% hardship
                    differential. We used that to pay these teachers with those funds. My wife first
                    tried to teach the children at home, but we soon found out that it's very
                    difficult for a mother also to be a teacher. They have discipline problems. The
                    teaching wives were very good; the kids loved them and worked very hard to
                    please them. That was probably the best education they received in all of their
                    lives. So that worked out well.</p>
                <p>Our oldest child was not with us. He attended a boarding school in Switzerland.
                    His younger brother attended the same school for one semester. That didn't work
                    out very well; so he returned home which worked out well. We had looked at the
                    Swiss school, which looked good to us. It turned out to be anything but; it was
                    a money making device. The only positive part of his experience was that he
                    learned how to ski. A lot of broken families sent their kids to this school.
                    They didn't know what else to do with them. That did not make for a very good
                    atmosphere. We had an allowance which paid for the costs of the school. There
                    were a number of Lebanese children at the school and our son became friendly
                    with them. They invited him to join them in Beirut where he could attend the
                    American school. He decided he wanted to do that, and we permitted him to go to
                    Beirut. Beirut at the time was not a sea of calm; there were constant shootings
                    and bombings, but the school was kept open and so we let him go. It was crazy.
                    We did have some friends who worked for Shell Oil in Beirut; they looked after
                    him. He fortunately did not need much help; he was very self sufficient.</p>
                <p>As I said, Gabon was comfortable situation for us and the kids. We had an
                    “evacuation boat;” a high powered speed boat. We used to water ski. Libreville
                    was on an estuary which was about twelve miles across. We rented a cottage on
                    the water and spent our week-ends there, skiing, swimming and fishing That was
                    our evacuation mode!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other places, we had emergency water storage places,
                        which were a cover name for swimming pools. Those provided the only
                        recreation in the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>NELSON: We had this high powered boat - two 50 horsepower engines which would let
                    you travel for a few hours. But where would one go? So we used the boat for
                    recreation, which was wonderful for our whole family. We had had a small
                    sailboat in Finland. I wanted to get another one, and we did. That allowed us to
                    spend even more time on the water, which was great. That was a life-saver
                    because the paved roads ended about 25 miles outside of the city. It was
                    possible to drive over other roads, if they weren't too rutty. We had a terrible
                    time convincing businessmen not to use these roads in the rainy season because
                    they would be ruined and then would not be available any longer even in the dry
                    season. I am not sure how many paid any attention to us. In any case, the lack
                    of a road system made Libreville pretty isolated; we could fly out - to Lagos
                    for example - but it was very expensive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation in Gabon when you got
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: It was not very exciting. The country was pretty much under France's
                    thumb. The French ambassador was in effect the governor-general. The political
                    situation was quite calm. President Omar Bongo stood in good stead with the
                    French. There had been some anti-American ferment before our arrival, but it was
                    quite modest, and we never saw any such thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the cause of such ferment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I don't really know. The French may have been behind that, but that is
                    just speculation. When anything goes wrong, we blame the French. We couldn't
                    prove anything. There was no CIA presence in Gabon. We had had a small
                    assistance program and a had small USIS (United States Information Service)
                    office. The assistance program had been terminated, although there was some
                    residual work to be done to close the projects. I was given a small library of
                    AID regulations which I was supposed to read and know in closing this program. I
                    looked at the material and couldn't make heads or tails out of it. I suggested
                    to the ambassador that we not waste much time on this effort. I suggested that
                    he call the AID (Agency for International Development) regional office in Lagos
                    and inform it that we could not do what was required and if that office wanted
                    to follow-up, it should send someone to do the job. We were just not equipped to
                    do the job, even if we had figured out what needed to be done.</p>
                <p>Gabon didn't really need any aid. The French had a small police presence as well
                    as a more sizeable military force which was there primarily there for regional
                    purposes. The oil business was doing quite well. Gabon had no problems with any
                    of its neighbors that I can recall.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>We had a Peace Corps program in Gabon. It was a very good one. They worked in
                    teams of two, working in the bush, building schools and housing for the
                    teachers. The Gabonese had a teachers college in Libreville. The students would
                    come to the college for a couple of years. Once they had lived in the big city,
                    they didn't want to return to the hinterlands and live in a grass hut and teach
                    in a mud school house which was washed away with every heavy rain storm. So the
                    Peace Corps came up with the idea of building sheltered schools. The design was
                    ingenious so that in the summer time, breezes could blow through the building.
                    They also build some very nice small houses for the teachers. The Peace Corps
                    volunteers worked very hard; they taught the indigenous population how to do
                    this construction work - how to make the bricks, etc. It was a very successful
                    program.</p>
                <p>They also built shelters in various communities that could be used for political
                    meetings or other functions. They set up a little TV arrangement in these places
                    for the community to watch.</p>
                <p>After we had been in Gabon for about a year, suddenly around Christmas Day, we
                    were advised that the volunteers had to leave by the end of the year. No
                    explanation. I talked to people in the President's office and the Foreign
                    Ministry and they said that they were not at liberty to discuss the matter and
                    that the volunteers would have to leave. Some of the volunteers were far in the
                    bush and not easily reached. We did manage to contact all of them. They
                    straggled into Libreville and most of them came to our house where they slept in
                    the backyard. They used our facilities. We arranged for a plane to take them to
                    Sierra Leone - hardly my choice as safe haven. Some of the volunteers had
                    several days to kill before the plane would arrive. The kids had time on their
                    hands. Although they were being kicked out of the country, they decided to go to
                    help to finish a construction project in Libreville before they left. What
                    dedication! I was impressed by their attitude. And they followed through and
                    managed to get the building completed. Of course, the government never expressed
                    any appreciation for this extraordinary effort.</p>
                <p>But we did manage to evacuate all the Peace Corps volunteers. The ambassador was
                    away in the U.S., so I reported the events in Gabon immediately. No response. So
                    I reported it again. Silence. No response at all. Soon after I sent the report,
                    I was called to the president's office to attend a cabinet meeting. I was asked
                    what our protest delivered to the Gabonian embassy in Washington was all about.
                    It was related to the Peace Corps. I had to confess that I didn't have a clue;
                    nobody had told me anything, but I knew what the Department probably said. So I
                    speculated what the protest might say. But I felt quite naked in Libreville
                    because no one in Washington would keep us informed at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>I assumed that the French may have had something to do with the withdrawal of the
                    Peace Corps. I thought that someone in the France became very nervous about the
                    Peace Corps presence in Gabon. It did have the reputation of stirring unrest.
                    They kept preaching that people had to demand their rights, which probably made
                    the French nervous. I assume that perhaps some of our volunteers had indeed
                    talked about the benefits of democracy, but I think much was imagined. Crews of
                    two are not likely to stir up any rebellion. But the French were nervous. In
                    addition they had their own Peace Corps-like operation, but few of the
                    participants were college graduates. They found it difficult to understand or
                    believe that a college graduate would spend time in the bush; they would be
                    concerned about a career and not some altruistic exercise. So the French
                    concluded that the volunteers were probably CIA agents, which were a threat.
                    That was our rationale for French attitudes. Some years later, the Peace Corps
                    was allowed to start a program again.</p>
                <p>At about this time, the Biafran - in Nigeria - war broke out. The French was on
                    the side of the Ibos (the Biafrans). We supported the other side because our
                    main goal was to hold the country together because if one country split along
                    tribal lines, then it would happen in the whole continent. Ours was a quite
                    justified policy. The French for some reason supported one of the Nigerian
                    tribes. Gabon became a base of operations for the support of the Ibos. So we had
                    an enormous amount of air activity. We began to keep track of air traffic; we
                    hoped surreptitiously, but I don't know that we succeeded. But I doubt whether
                    anybody cared. So we tried to identify the planes and noticed that many came
                    from the U.S., which was very interesting. We reported our findings daily - all
                    the details we could muster - numbers and types. I even got my wife involved
                    watching and identifying the planes. There was a little beach by the airport
                    from where she could watch the end of the runway. From there she could watch the
                    landings and departures; so she would lie on the beach with her notebook. At the
                    end of the day, looking tan, she would give me her report. So we spent a lot of
                    time on this effort. Whether it was useful or not, I don't know, but our reports
                    were avidly consumed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were American planes involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: These were planes belonging to private entrepreneurs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interesting story because there many quarters
                        in the U.S., including members and staff of Congress, that supported
                        Biafra's independence.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>NELSON: Indeed. Norman Cousins, of the Saturday Review, was one of the advocates.
                    He came out to visit us. He irked me and my wife because he made a point of the
                    “extended bellies” of Nigerian children. He had never talked about the children
                    in the Congo who also suffered from starvation and malnutrition. There was a
                    political group in the U.S. that became associated with the Biafra rebellion. We
                    had a lot of Ibo friends both in the Congo and Gabon, and they were outstanding.
                    They did their best to help the new fledgling African countries. We met a lot of
                    others who were trying their best to make these new countries viable entities.
                    They were also very kind to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your thoughts about Bongo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: He was a young man, a puppet of the French. He never exercised much
                    visible independence during my tour at least. He was able to keep on top of
                    things. He was not troubled by an excessive number of tribes. I think there were
                    only two or three in Gabon. When OPEC was founded, he changed his name to Omar
                    because he had joined OPEC; he may have become a Muslim around this time as
                    well. One must conclude that he found some way to make a little money and be
                    admitted to the right class of people. I think he is still alive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Chinese or the Soviets at all engaged in

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We had no concern for their possible activities. The French made sure
                    that neither could play a mischievous role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your relations with the French embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Cordial. One day while my youngest son and I were sailing, probably
                    getting ready to transport people to our cabin across the estuary. My son was
                    about nine or ten. He was at the wheel of the boat. As he was looking around, he
                    said that he noticed someone who appeared to be in trouble. Sure enough, there
                    was a bow of a boat sticking our of the water. It was obviously sinking. So I
                    said we should investigate and we did. As we got close to the boat we noticed
                    two people in the water. They were being held up by an up-side down cooler. By
                    this time the boat had completely sunk. So we took them on board and thereby
                    saved their lives, thanks to my son's keen eyesight and alertness. They were
                    obviously grateful; we delivered them to their cottage and left them on shore
                    safe and sound.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Some months later, we received a note from the French embassy saying that a medal
                    had been struck in memory of our rescue mission. The French are great on medals
                    and related ceremonies. Every week they would have a ceremony and sometimes we
                    would go because friends of ours were being honored. If they had followed normal
                    practice, they would have presented the medal in a public ceremony in front of
                    Gabonese and Frenchmen. It would have meant honoring an American. We received
                    the medal by messenger.</p>
                <p>So we held our own ceremony, complete with press conference and an ambassadorial
                    presentation. As I said, we had cordial relations with the French, but I am sure
                    they would have preferred it if we had not been there. We made them nervous.</p>
                <p>Q; You left Gabon in 1969. What was your next assignment?</p>
                <p>NELSON: We came back to Washington where I was assigned to the African bureau
                    where I became the deputy director of the office for southern African affairs. I
                    stayed there until 1971.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your office cover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We covered Zambia, Rhodesia, Mozambique, Angola, South Africa and
                    Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are now at the beginning of the Nixon administration.

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I can't really answer that question because I arrived after the
                    administration had taken office. I don't really know what the initial reaction
                    might have been. I don't remember my new colleagues talking about the change in
                    administrations to any great length.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I raised the question because many observers have said
                        that neither the President or Kissinger seemed very interested in Africa.

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We were witness to the disintegration of South Africa. That may not have
                    been obvious at the time, but in retrospect, the situation was changing starting
                    around this time. Our focus was on the “Unilateral Declaration of Independence”
                    emanating from Southern Rhodesia under Ian Smith. The embargo on Rhodesia
                    continued in an effort to get the white leadership to come to terms with the
                    black majority. The white population was only about 4% - very small, but very
                    much in control. In South Africa, the white population was about 17-20%.</p>

                <p>NELSON: I don't recall any divisions. There may have been some disagreements on
                    how hard we should push the Rhodesians. I think our policy was very
                    conservative; we did not do enough to satisfy a lot of the Third World. We had a
                    lot of trouble all over the world from those countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in consideration of our policy and its
                        implementation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Very little. I was asked for my opinion by the office director, Mike
                    Crosby, but he carried the dialogue within the Department and with other
                    agencies. He was a first rate officer. He was well respected. I worked well with
                    him and he was very helpful. He allowed me to have part of the action, which I
                    greatly appreciated. We had discussions, but he was the one that dealt with
                    other parts of the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any idea how the southern Rhodesia crisis
                        would be resolved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: No. We just insisted that the white power structure come to terms with
                    the black population. Our general philosophy was that this was a matter for the
                    Rhodesians to settle. We could not impose our solution. But we could push. Some
                    people thought we should push harder. We tried to encourage Americans to leave
                    Rhodesia, which most did. But outfits like Hertz and Avis remained; they were
                    franchises.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there considerable Hill pressure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Dingell was a very strong figure. He was a leader in the Black Caucus. He
                    kept after us. Of course, I met him many times in the next few years. I had a
                    high regard for the congressman. He did his homework. He knew what he was
                    talking about. He knew what he wanted. And he was effective. He made a lot of
                    troubles for us. He wanted us to be more active and up-front in pushing the
                    South African government and Ian Smith to making changes in their racial
                    policies. Whenever he went after us on those issues, he was well prepared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I remember correctly, we had by this time withdrawn our

                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>NELSON: We had no relationship with Ian Smith at all. We had to work at arms'
                    length. That is one of the consequences in withdrawing representation. We did
                    not have access. We didn't even have an interest section, which is often a
                    solution to some the possible consequences of breaking diplomatic relations. We
                    worked with Castro through our interest section. We didn't break diplomatic
                    relations until we were assured that we could have such a section.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: No. Nothing happened as far as I knew.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: That is right. They wouldn't spend any of their time on these matters.
                    They wanted to avoid spending any money in the area. We were supposed to keep
                    our hand in and not cause any problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have contact with the British embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Some. I had contacts with media people, particularly South African
                    journalists, interested in that part of Africa. The embassy contacts were mostly
                    discussions, comparing notes and impressions.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Angola and Mozambique were still Portuguese at the time?
                        Did you have much to do on those colonies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Yes; they didn't gain independence until a few years later. We didn't
                    have much to do with the Portuguese. It was not an area of focus for us. That
                    was unfortunate because the situation in these colonies was coming apart. The
                    Portuguese just couldn't support these colonies economically. They weren't
                    getting anything out of Mozambique, and Angola was just trouble. So it was hard
                    for the Portuguese. Portugal was a member of NATO. In retrospect, I don't think
                    we handled the problems in this area very well. We didn't pay enough
                    attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were we dealing with South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>NELSON: We were pretty soft on South Africa. We viewed them as “God-fearing”
                    folks. We were pretty easy on them. We did make it known that we opposed
                    apartheid. We wanted that system terminated. But we didn't for example vote for
                    UN resolutions highly critical of South Africa. We didn't support sanctions. It
                    was a long time before we became very active on apartheid. The issue was not a
                    very high priority for the Nixon Administration. There was no strategic interest
                    that would have been served by our pressures. The Soviet Union was not much of a
                    factor in the area of Africa that I covered.</p>
                <p>One of the advantages South Africa had was that it was staunchly anti-communist.
                    The government thought that most of the rabble rousing in the black population
                    came from domestic communists. So the government was much on our side in the
                    Cold War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we watch the ANC (African National Congress) at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: It had people in South Africa, although most of the leadership resided
                    outside the country. They did mount terrorist operations as well as very vocal
                    propaganda campaigns. They were active agitators. With Mandela in jail and the
                    leadership outside the country, the ANC could not become a very influential
                    organization. I don't think we communicated with the ANC very much. This was
                    another preference of the Nixon administration. Communications with the ANC was
                    not pushed at all. They were not to be encouraged by us showing any interest in
                    them. I am sure that some contacts must have taken place overseas and they may
                    have had some in Washington, but I didn't really know. We had a lot of
                    clandestine contacts, but as a government, we were not really engaged or
                    concerned with the ANC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned about Soviet influence in Mozambique or
                        Angola?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Certainly. We thought that particularly in Angola that the Netto group
                    was greatly influenced by the Soviets. After the Cuban troops became involved in
                    the war against South Africa, we were certain that the Soviets were involved. We
                    supported a group headed by Holden Roberto who was much more conservative. It
                    was a splinter group which was totally unsuccessful. We also supported Savimbi
                    who had the support of South Africa. That policy continued for a number of
                    years.</p>
                <p>But in general, we were not supposed to spend much of the U.S. government's
                    energy on my part of Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the assistant secretary for African affairs during

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: It was David Newsom. He was a very competent leader.</p>

                        Seminar. Did you enjoy that year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: It was a wonderful year. It was fantastic. I liked the mix of people. I
                    liked the experiences we had. It is the kind of assignment that most Foreign
                    Service officers should have. We learned a lot about what was going on the U.S.,
                    which we would never have learned had it not been for the Senior Seminar. We met
                    all parts of society including hippies and revolutionary women's groups. The
                    most shocking session we had was with some very aggressive women who used the
                    foulest language. Here were these meek Foreign Service officers, Department of
                    Agriculture people, a Marine Corps officer; we were all shocked by the language
                    these women used. It was quite an experience. It is one thing to read about
                    these women or see them on TV, but to meet them close up was quite an
                    experience. That was a good experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the Senior Seminar, what came next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I went out as DCM to Zambia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Zambia like in 1972?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: At that point, Zambia was pretty much in the grip of President Kenneth
                    Kaunda. He had been president since independence in 1964. He was in a pretty
                    secure position. Zambia was doing fairly well. It had a pretty good size welfare
                    budget based on copper income. The copper mines were essentially run by South
                    African firms, but that was seldom mentioned. Zambia had a farming sector
                    dominated by whites. They were good farmers; their biggest crops were tobacco
                    and corn.</p>
                <p>The country was relatively stable although there was some political turmoil.
                    Kaunda had been in power for many years, and some were beginning to chafe at
                    that. The country was trying to be in a leadership role in fighting South Africa
                    and Southern Rhodesia. It was beginning to be involved in the collapse of the
                    Smith regime. So it was engaged - sometimes positively and sometimes not
                    helpfully.</p>
                <p>Our ambassador was Jean Mary Wilkowski. A very dynamic woman. She had been in
                    Latin America, and this was her first and I think her only ambassadorship. She
                    had a very strong personality. She was quite blunt with the staff. She upset the
                    staff on several occasions because of her bluntness. In fact, she loved them
                    all, but she didn't project that. I learned this over a period of time.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>I first met her in a hall in the Department. She was as tall if not taller than I
                    am. I think that in college she had been a basketball player. She was striding
                    along when I stopped her to introduce myself as her new deputy. The first thing
                    she said to me was that “they didn't even give me chance to choose my own DCM.”
                    I am sure she didn't mean how it sounded. She was just bluntly stating a fact.
                    She probably felt pushed around a little bit, and she didn't like it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like that as DCM you spent some time smoothing
                        over ruffled feathers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I did a certain amount of that. My wife was enormously helpful in helping
                    me. For all her faults, I had a great attachment to Jean Mary. I haven't been in
                    touch for years, but I suddenly thought of her this morning. She had some
                    physical problems even as ambassador, and I don't know her condition now.</p>
                <p>We made it work, and I gained an enormous respect for her despite all the gripes
                    about her. She stood on her rights as an ambassador, which got her into trouble
                    with Kissinger just about the time I was leaving Lusaka. She was a damn good
                    representative of the U.S. She had the staff in the palm of her hands. They
                    appreciated her. They may have joked about her behind her back, but they
                    respected her. And that was what she was being paid for - as I told the staff
                    periodically. I told them they had to live with her personality. We were
                    accomplishing our tasks, and she was doing what she was paid to do. She was in
                    Lusaka not to coddle us but to represent the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our Zambian policy at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We had an AID program. We were trying to strengthen Zambia's economy.
                    During my three years there, I noted the usual African reaction which was to
                    blame foreign colonialism for their problems. To certain extent, of course, they
                    were right. When the copper price plummeted, it meant a serious budgetary
                    short-fall. Zambia had no money! Copper prices did not recover. Kaunda's
                    solution was to nationalize the mines without any compensation. And then he
                    rehired the same mining companies which had been in charge before
                    nationalization. That was obviously more expensive. Now they have sold the mines
                    back to the companies.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>The government's relationships with the white farmers were tense. Those farmers
                    were doing very well; they lived well as Rhodesian land owners. They brought in
                    foreign exchange, much of which they pocketed. But there was still plenty for
                    the country. The farmers were very good, and the land was quite fruitful. The
                    Zambians might have known about subsistence farming but knew little about
                    managing large and productive farms. Interestingly enough, the same criticism
                    might have been made about a number of the white land-owners. They had been in
                    the British military and had decided to stay in Zambia after its independence.
                    They started farming without much background. Labor was cheap and plentiful, and
                    they managed somehow. I was just visiting in England about three weeks ago with
                    one of those land-owners, who was chased out. The government had put so many
                    financial restrictions on farming that he just left. Of course, the farmers were
                    breaking many of the financial laws while we were there. But the country was
                    still profiting from their labors. But the whites worried about their kids and
                    whether they would be able to pay for their education. So many left, although
                    there were also many who remained.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of commercial farming did Zambia have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Maize and tobacco. Those were the major products. Maize was the stable
                    crop. If there weren't huge mounts of maize at the end of the harvest season,
                    then the country was in trouble, not only to feed Zambia's population but also
                    to maintain some exports. Sugar was another major cash crop. All the farms
                    depended on British and South African farmers.</p>
                <p>I have already mention copper which was the largest foreign exchange earner. But
                    as I said, the price really took a dive and is still in the doldrums today. The
                    Chinese built a railroad through Tanzania to Dar es Salaam. The Zambians had
                    smelters, so that not all of the raw ore had to be exported. Much of the product
                    and the ore was probably shipped out by train and truck. When the embargo was
                    put on Southern Rhodesia, that blocked exports going through there. That was the
                    genesis of the road construction to Tanzania so that the ore could be shipped to
                    Dar es Salaam. This was even before the railroad was built. We were asked
                    whether we would be interested in building the railroad. We declined.</p>

                <p>NELSON: I really wasn't. The legacy of McCarthy taught me that we were
                    over-reacting to the communist threat. They built a railroad. The construction
                    workers were confined and studied their little red books; they rarely mixed with
                    the Zambians. The railroad was pretty neat. I remember one day while my wife and
                    I were driving in the bush probably heading for Tanzania, we passed a truck load
                    of Chinese workers, who were singing and have a great time. We waved to them.
                    One almost waved back but didn't. The fact that a westerner would wave to them
                    undoubtedly made them suspicious. I don't think the Chinese made much of an
                    impact on the Zambians. Of course, the country expressed gratitude for the
                    construction of the railroad, but I don't think the Chinese left a communist
                    legacy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What impression did you have of Kaunda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We dealt with him very directly. If we needed to talk to him, we would
                    just call him. We knew his principal advisor who was a very able young man.
                    Zambia is a small country so that personal relationships are developed. Of
                    course, we didn't always reach him when we phoned, but then we could talk to his
                    advisor who could be relied on to pass a message on to the president. When we
                    went to the president's house for dinner, Kaunda served. When we washed up
                    before the meal, the president brought the bowl and towels; everybody washed up
                    in the same water. Then he would stand behind a buffet table and ladle out the
                    food. It was very informal and Kaunda was very personal. He had a nice sense of
                    humor; very steady. The atmosphere was very informal; Wilkowski had access to
                    him any time she needed it. I also could get word to him, usually through his
                    advisor.</p>
                <p>That does not mean that things got done. Kaunda did not have people who were very
                    good at getting things done. The system didn't work well. We once were ready to
                    make an $8 million grant. We had a terrible time getting a Zambian to sign off
                    on it. All they had to do is sign the agreement, and we would hand over the
                    check. Time was beginning to run out. I remember the ambassador finally getting
                    the minister of finance out of bed to tell him that unless Zambia signed the
                    agreement, the funds would not longer be available after midnight. He
                    reluctantly agreed. But we had to force the grant down their throats. It was put
                    to good use, but this was an illustration of the problems the Zambians had in
                    making government work.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned about Kaunda's human rights record?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>NELSON: We had some discussions, but it wasn't a big thing. He didn't have much
                    opposition so that the issue of human rights didn't really come up. Kaunda was
                    unusual in that he really was a Malawian and therefore did not belong to any
                    Zambian tribe. Of course there were people then and even more so now that he is
                    trying to make a political comeback that held his antecedents against him. In
                    fact, because he didn't belong to any tribe, he was not a threat to any of them
                    and therefore quite acceptable to all. At the time, the fact that he was a
                    Malawian was not mentioned; it is now much more of a factor. Although his small
                    tribe also spilled over into Zambia, it was no threat to the other tribes. If he
                    had any political enemies, they were not many, and Kaunda did not feel the need
                    to take any actions against them. So he did not run a repressive regime,
                    although he did behave undemocratically when he felt the need for some direct
                    action.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Yes, but not very successfully during this period, particularly on
                    southern Africa issues. It was an absolutely impossible task. Wilkowski would
                    often spend time with the president or other high officials trying to garner
                    votes and I would too. But all we can say is that we tried, but usually not very
                    successfully.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much of a factor was South Africa in U.S.-Zambia
                        relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>NELSON: They believed that we should be on the same side with them and other
                    African countries to change South African behavior, including if necessary the
                    use of our forces. They wanted the white regime driven out. We had a lot of
                    unrealism in Zambia. Kaunda tried to be in the forefront of this anti-white
                    regime movement, along with Julius Nyerere of Tanzania - a colleague and
                    sometime competitor for the international spotlight. They were aggressive about
                    South Africa and Southern Rhodesia first and Mozambique and Angola secondly.
                    Kaunda had two or three meetings with South African and Southern Rhodesian
                    leadership in a railroad car on a bridge spanning the Zambezi river. These were
                    publicly announced meetings the content of which was kept secret. The Zambian
                    press was pretty much controlled, so we knew little about these meetings. He
                    tried to influence the leadership of these other countries to provide greater
                    rights to the black population. Being a reasonable man, it is quite possible
                    that Kaunda had some impact. He did have a certain amount of courage because his
                    negotiations were sometime viewed skeptically by his African colleagues. They
                    would never have even looked at a South African or Southern Rhodesian white. On
                    one occasion, he really got quite angry with the South Africans, which was quite
                    risky since the Zambians depended on South Africa for some agricultural
                    products, which they could probably could have produced themselves. These goods
                    came by train which would have to change engines at the bridge so that a Zambian
                    could drive the train to Lusaka. Kaunda put an embargo on these imports which
                    meant that the Zambians would have a very limited diet. That became a very tough
                    situation because there really wasn't an alternative source for the agricultural
                    products. Eventually, without any announcement, the embargo was lifted although
                    the imports were disguised. For example, we suddenly found Botswana apples in
                    the market. Now Botswana did not grow apples; these were South African imports
                    in disguise. This might well have been the bright idea of some South African who
                    suggested covert ways to restart the import program. We did lose South African
                    wines and that was unfortunate. They never came back in any bottles.</p>
                <p>So there were some tough moments due to Kaunda's stance against South Africa. He
                    truly believed that he was in the right. His actions were not for effect. I
                    think he truly found the South African regime odious. Since he was asking other
                    countries, like the U.S., to take a tough line against South Africa, he
                    undoubtedly felt that his country had to make a showing. I don't think that his
                    pressure had much effect in South Africa.</p>

                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>NELSON: I didn't know much about what Nyerere was doing. I believe that he was
                    taking a lot of private property and giving it to communities. He had to move
                    people around the country to do that. That was pretty harsh and difficult. We
                    had friends in Mombasa with whom we exchanged visits. They had a Tanzanian
                    working for them. He finally had to go home because his family which lived in
                    Tanzania had been moved off their farm. They had refused to join the communes
                    which left them entirely stranded. I understood that this happen quite often. We
                    did find him in Dar once when we visited there. He was trying to run a little
                    shop, but he no longer had a family farm to fall back on. The communal farms did
                    not do well.</p>

                <p>NELSON: Unfortunately, you can find examples of that process all over the world,
                    not just in Africa. Radical change all at once seems to be a recipe for
                    catastrophe. It is just destructive.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Zambia a listening post for what was happening in
                        South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Yes. We had a large number of “freedom” fighters from Southern Rhodesia.
                    There were some of Savimbi's people in Zambia from Angola. We had Namibians -
                    the SWAPO (South West Africa People's Organization) people. There may have been
                    some from Mozambique as well, but I didn't have any contact with them. I saw the
                    other people, particularly the Zimbabweans. They were also “ freedom” fighters.
                    I went to Harare last spring and saw some of them for a couple of days. My
                    closest contact works for LANRO, a British international corporation. He was
                    pulled out of Zambia on a couple of occasions.</p>
                <p>The Southern Rhodesian “liberation” movement was split. The divide was so bad
                    that they were killing each other, for reasons that were never quite clear to
                    me. It was murderous stuff. There was one black leader, who had been an attorney
                    in Southern Rhodesia. He finally had to leave because he was just too
                    successful. He used the available white courts and ran rings around the white
                    legal profession in the protection of many accused, including some whites. He
                    then became involved in the “liberation” movement and moved to Zambia. He was a
                    very interesting guy, who became a very good friend of my wife. They had a nice
                    intellectual relationship with many exchanges. One morning, down the street, he
                    got into his car which had been booby trapped. It blew up and killed him. That
                    is what the Southern Rhodesians did to each other. My wife was broken hearted
                    and I also found it hard to accept.</p>
                <p>We knew a leader of the Namibian resistance group, but that was also split. He
                    later became at odds with Nujoma, who was the leader of the resistance. He ended
                    up in prison, sentenced to death, but fortunately that was never carried out. So
                    the Namibians also killed each other.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>These splits were bad news. It was tough enough to mount a resistance movement.
                    They didn't need internal feuding. But wherever you go, there are people who
                    become power hungry regardless of cause.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Yes; we did not get involved in their operations. We had a small CIA
                    office, which might well have done more which I may not have known about. I knew
                    much of what CIA was doing, but I can't guarantee that I knew all.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: One of the big events was the nationalization of the mines. There wasn't
                    much we could do about it except wring our hands. We were in touch with the
                    government and the South Africans-who had been running the mines on behalf of
                    the Anglo-American Corporation. But as I indicated earlier, the managers
                    returned to work for the government-owned corporation. We made an effort to
                    counsel Kaunda that perhaps he should not pursue nationalization or find a way
                    not to expropriate the mines. I think in the final analysis, some compromise was
                    worked out with the Anglo-American Corporation being compensated for their
                    property. So the issue was not quite as acute as it appeared originally.</p>
                <p>Zambia became the venue for the talks between Portuguese, the Mozambicans and the
                    Angolans. They all came together in Lusaka. The embassy did not play a role in
                    these negotiations. It was an interesting process. The meetings were held at the
                    State House, under the chairmanship of Kaunda or his representative. They began
                    to work on how these two colonies would achieve their independence. That was a
                    big event. The leader of the Mozambican delegation was by Samora Machel. I took
                    my daughter once to a social event where we met and talked to Neto, Dispasse and
                    Machel. That was interesting because they were powerful people. My daughter and
                    Machel got along quite famously.</p>
                <p>When anybody significant would come to Lusaka or leave Lusaka, the diplomatic
                    corps would show up the airport, line up and shake hands. We spent a lot of time
                    doing that. I used to take my daughter with me; she stood behind me. Once when
                    Machel returned, he came to me and pushed me aside so he could embrace my
                    daughter, who was sixteen at the time. She was a very pretty blond with long
                    hair.</p>

                <p>NELSON: We had a watching brief. There may well have been some instructions to
                    which I was not privy. I think we probably talked to the government in Portugal.
                    It would have been stupid not to. We certainly wanted the Portuguese to know
                    that we supported the independence process, and I am sure that we offered any
                    assistance that might have been helpful. I am sure the CIA was active among the
                    Mozambicans and the Angolans. But the embassy had no instructions beyond
                    watching and reporting. We knew that we could encourage the participants to
                    reach a satisfactory resolution.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: No, because the American interest was minuscule. Our share of the
                    Anglo-American Corporation was very small. We were more concerned with the
                    policy of nationalization because as an aid donor intending to beef up Zambia's
                    economy we found the government following policies which we felt certain would

                <p>NELSON: I really don't know. My speculation is that in part it may have been out
                    of pique. Kaunda had a tendency to act that way. I don't know where he got his
                    advice, but he did act emotionally when he was angry with somebody. I doubt that
                    in this case that was the sole reason. After all, it was a major decision. It
                    probably stemmed more from his belief that foreign ownership of the mines was
                    not working; and, therefore, they should be taken over by Zambia.</p>

                    Kaunda's close friends were people like Nyerere. It is quite possible that he
                    got advice from him. Or Nyerere might have suggested that he talk to someone who
                    spouted that economic philosophy. I don't know for sure that that is what
                    happened, but it certainly could have. Kaunda certainly had a socialist bias,
                    but I don't know really how he came to make the nationalization decision.</p>

                <p>NELSON: I returned to the Department, but there was no job for me. That fall I
                    went to the UN General Assembly as a member of the U.S. delegation. I was the
                    African “expert” to help the permanent African expert in the U.S. mission. We
                    had a couple of experts for each region, but the African experts really were
                    busy covering fifty countries.</p>
                <p>Pat Moynihan was our ambassador to the UN at this time. He was a very colorful
                    and forthright person. He was a wonderful story teller. One would never want to
                    miss one of his staff meetings. There was a lot of activity. He was also a very
                    intimidating person. He had very strong opinions, and you argued with him at
                    your peril. I certainly never did, and I don't think that others in my position
                    and personality did. It was a whole new experience for me. We worried about
                    southern Africa and the Middle East. In those days, we were on a real losing
                    streak. The only countries that voted with us consistently were Taiwan and
                    Israel.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting time because Moynihan liked to be outspoken. There was no
                    restraint on him since we had nothing to lose. He really let loose on several
                    occasions which made him quite popular in the American media. He spoke out and
                    thereby also gained respect of the U.S. government. We didn't make much mileage
                    in the UN, but we had a lot of fun doing it.</p>
                <p>I was trying to sway others to side with us. That was a hopeless task. I would go
                    to the delegates' lounge and look for people to talk to. In some ways, it was a
                    desolate kind of job. I would try to find delegates and talk to them about what
                    was going on and talk to them what we might do for them if they would help us.
                    It was essentially a lobbying task.</p>
                <p>The most interesting action was in the Security Council, but I was much too
                    junior to participate in that. I have always resented that. All in all, my
                    assignment to the UN was a great experience. I got to know a lot of Africans and
                    learned something about the UN. As I said, we didn't get very far, but we were
                    flamboyant. The populace loved it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any effort to link UN votes to U.S. aid? Did it
                        have much effect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: As I suggested, there certainly was. I don't think we were quite that
                    blatant to make the connection overtly, but I don't think we left many in doubt
                    about our implications. We would say that we could not get Congressional
                    appropriations unless the country did so and so. We would shift the burden to
                    the Congress quite properly.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>The big event as far as I was concerned was the appearance of Idi Amin, the
                    murderous president of Uganda. He spoke to the General Assembly. He is a big
                    man, who is still living in Saudi Arabia. He strode to the microphone and spoke
                    in Swahili which brought the house down. Nobody had ever spoken for Africa in
                    Swahili. Many thought it was the greatest thing that ever happened in the UN. He
                    spoke for about two minutes and then handed his speech to his ambassador. He
                    moved to a throne that had been placed on the stage and looked over the
                    delegates. It was a ludicrous sight. The poor ambassador couldn't read very
                    well. He was ever after referred to as the “reader.” He stumbled through the
                    rest of the Amin speech, which was primarily a denunciation of the U.S. and
                    great laudatory praise for the Africans which were doing so much good and
                    anti-Israel and South Africa. Then the General Assembly adopted the resolution
                    equating Zionism with racism, which really made us hot under the collar.
                    Moynihan was out of town for this performance. He was in San Francisco speaking
                    to the Commonwealth Club. When he heard about this issue, he raced back. He
                    called me when I was on the floor, wanting to know where the longest applause
                    took place. I couldn't really remember because Amin's speech had been applauded
                    all along. Moynihan of course wanted to know what issues seemed to be close to
                    the hearts of the delegates. It was a performance that the Africans loved
                    because they viewed Amin as the first leader to speak their feelings. They loved
                    it and passed the anti-Israel resolution which passed handily. That was an
                    explosive time and a great time for Moynihan's bombastic style.</p>
                <p>There were a number of U.S. delegates who were political appointees. Pearl
                    Bailey, the singer, was one of them. She was delightful with a strong
                    personality. I loved my association with her. One day we were sitting in our
                    places in the Assembly when the Cuban delegate stood up at the podium lambasting
                    the U.S. It was really a terrible attack on the U.S. I don't remember what
                    stimulated it, but it was awful. We were totally unprepared. There is a right of
                    reply. Bailey asked me whether she could deliver our reply. I said: “I guess
                    so.” We raised our sign so that we would be recognized. She went on the podium.
                    She was so good. She took the Cuban to the cleaners - ad lib all the way. She
                    just wasn't going to stand for that propaganda. He denounced us as a racist
                    society. Since she was an African-American, she showed what a lie that was. It
                    was great; it was a delight. She had a lot of strength. Her husband was a jazz
                    drummer. She always mentioned him when she talked about her profession. She
                    never wanted the sole spotlight. I gained a great respect for her. At the time,
                    she was appearing in “Hello, Dolly.” Once she appeared in costume at the
                    assembly. I went one night to see the show. One of her former colleagues, a
                    former white dancer, was in the audience that night. Pearl asked her to come to
                    the stage. She asked this lovely old lady to dance a few steps. It was the
                    sweetest gesture. It still gives me an emotional twinge. Pearl was an angel!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a better appreciation after your UN
                        experience of the list of demands that we ask embassies to transmit to their

                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>NELSON: I don't think that is an exercise in futility. On occasions, we got some
                    results. We learned about mutual interests, which we might not had done if we
                    didn't have these exchanges about the UN. Either side might not have known where
                    the other stood and why. So I think from that point of view, the exchanges are
                    useful. Some of the work we did was quite useless. We try to sell our point of
                    view all over the world even though much of it is unacceptable to other
                    countries. I think one of the advantages of the work in the UN is that is can
                    humanize people. It can help to develop personal relations and therefore access.
                    That is very helpful when something really important comes along. Some of the
                    work seems somewhat ridiculous, but over all it is helpful. You can chuckle with
                    the president of the Chad over some of the foolishness. That can help.</p>

                <p>NELSON: I think we were seen as misguided. Some of our positions seemed
                    incomprehensible to the Africans. We had power, we had money; they thought we
                    could solve the problems in one day if we wanted to. In general, I think we were
                    liked and had the resources to accomplish anything we wanted to. After all, we
                    had put a man on the moon. The South Africa problem seemed easy to solve when
                    compared to that feat.</p>

                <p>NELSON: Yes, indeed. Sometimes it was awkward; sometimes what you said fell kind

                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>NELSON: I was there for a short time - for less than a year. Our biggest
                    challenge was the Panama Canal treaty. There was enormous resistance to the
                    treaty in Congress. I must say that Congressional Relations is in an odd
                    position. By statute, it is not supposed to lobby. What else is it in business
                    for? We “passed information” or “advised.” In fact, I think we were lobbying,
                    but nobody challenged what we were doing. It was a very interesting experience.
                    I enjoyed it tremendously and would have liked to stay there for at least two
                    years.</p>
                <p>I spent most of my time trying to sell the Panama Canal treaty. I had to learn a
                    lot about it and tried to stay a little ahead of the Congressional members and
                    staff. So I had to study the background and keep current. Much of that I did by
                    talking to the experts. It was a whole new experience. As I said, I enjoyed it
                    although selling does not come naturally to me. In fact, I don't like it, but
                    that is what we did in Congressional Relations, and I learned to live with it. I
                    thought the audience would be much different from that with which I had dealt
                    before. It turned out that it wasn't that different. The Congress is made up of
                    human beings like the rest of us. They had certain powers that others did not
                    have, but essentially they were like others. I learned to have a great deal of
                    respect for the members and the staff. As I mentioned earlier, my grandfather
                    had been a senator for forty years, although I never watched him working in
                    Washington. I used to spend full days on the Hill two or three times a week. I
                    was impressed. Most of the congressmen were very responsible, “down home
                    folks.”</p>
                <p>I remember once talking to a Texas congressman who was very candid with me. He
                    was near the end of his career, but he wanted one more term. He told me that
                    although he really agreed that the treaty was necessary, if he voted for it, he
                    would not be re-elected. And he wanted that last term. He didn't say that he
                    would vote against the treaty and its implementation, but if he did it would
                    cost him a great deal. That was representative of the views of several others
                    although none spoke so starkly about the situation. So I found working with the
                    Hill an uplifting and enlightening experience. A lot of people who have worked
                    with the Hill for a long time, did not have same reaction as I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After that experience, you went back to the field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Right. I apparently made an incredible record in my short stint in H. I
                    am not sure why that was the impression, but people seemed to be more than
                    satisfied with my performance. I had one exciting moment when I was one of two
                    people on a list for ambassador to three lands: Swaziland, Lesotho and Botswana.
                    Kissinger was the secretary at the time. He knew the other fellow on the list,
                    Don Norland, and picked him. I don't blame the secretary; I probably would have
                    done the same thing. But it was an exciting moment; it was fun.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>Then Personnel came to me and said that they wanted to send me to South Africa as
                    DCM (Deputy Chief of Mission). I was told I could take or turn it down; there
                    would be no argument; the decision would be entirely mine. But those were still
                    the days when you went to where you were assigned. There was no bidding system.
                    I really wanted to stay in H. I was not particularly interested in South Africa.
                    My oldest children were in college by this time; only my daughter would have
                    accompanied us. I knew that she didn't want to go to South Africa. She had
                    serious objections to the apartheid policy. She had been there. She had another
                    year in high school. My wife had recently gotten a wonderful job - the first for
                    a long time since she had stayed home with the children. She became the
                    executive secretary to the dean of the Catholic University Law school. They were
                    involved in some interesting work, such as gun legislation. She was very happy
                    and I really was very reluctant to have her abandon that job. But we had kids in
                    college, and we looked at our financial situation. We were quite mercenary about
                    this: the tax situation, the mortgage costs, school costs and all other
                    expenses. Overseas, we would have been eligible for several allowances; we would
                    have gone broke unless we went to South Africa. So we decided to go.</p>
                <p>It was a good decision as it turned out. It was very interesting. Both of us were
                    able to be useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: From 1976 to 1979. The ambassador was first Bill Bowdler. I had replaced
                    Bill Edmondson, who came out as ambassador in 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1976, what was the political situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: It was a key period. The Johannesburg township of Soweto went into
                    rebellion - mostly the young ones. This was the beginning of the end. Even the
                    white regime recognized then that it had to do something. When I was deputy
                    director of southern African affairs, I went out on an orientation trip to South
                    Africa. I was full of missionary zeal to get rid of apartheid, not understanding
                    the situation at all. I participated in many discussions lasting well into the
                    night with both blacks and whites. One old white Afrikaner said to me, in the
                    wee hours of the morning, that I was absolutely correct that apartheid could not
                    survive, but that that wasn't his problem. It would be his grandchildren's
                    problem. So there was a recognition that apartheid had to end. After the young
                    people in Soweto rioted and a number of people were killed, everybody remained
                    nervous because the turbulence continued even after the riots had passed. So it
                    was a very interesting time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in South Africa, who was the government
                        and how did we deal with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>NELSON: Botha became president in 1978. We engaged the government more and more
                    during my tour. We didn't work directly on South Africa's internal problems.
                    Rather we concentrated on trying to achieve independence for Namibia. There
                    seemed to be possibilities because there were several groups in South Africa -
                    Germans, South Africans, the colored population and the blacks, primarily the
                    Ovambos - and some political parties which seemed amenable. So there were
                    possible allies in South Africa. Don McHenry, a very talented African-American,
                    came out and started a process to gain independence for Namibia. We brought the
                    French and the Germans and the British in to join us in this effort. So we had a
                    consortium to work with the South Africans who were willing to consider some new
                    status for Namibia. No one knew exactly what that status might be. So we began
                    to work on some kind of process that would ultimately bring independence to
                    South-West Africa. The development of this process was in the works through my
                    entire tour. I think it moved pretty well, but we could not bring it to
                    fruition. But we developed a framework which was not used right away.</p>
                <p>Relationships with South Africa turned sour and we invoked sanctions and other
                    pressures. But the framework still existed and when the time was ripe and an
                    opportunity to move came along, that framework was used. It was not current but
                    bringing it up to date was not a major challenge. So it was a useful achievement
                    even if it did not pay off for several years. Secretary Cyrus Vance was
                    involved, and he visited South Africa. He was not only a very nice guy but
                    pretty effective with the South Africans. During the development of this
                    framework, we also began discussions on independence for Southern Rhodesia. That
                    was less successful, although there was some progress. We held some clandestine
                    meetings with Ian Smith in South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role in this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I was part of the group that worked on these issues. I made several trips
                    to South-West Africa and I attended one of the meetings with Ian Smith.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather from what you have said is that we put apartheid
                        aside and focused on Namibia and Southern Rhodesia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>NELSON: That is right. It was something akin to what we are trying to do in the
                    Middle East; work on peripheral issues saving the hardest to last. In cases like
                    those, it is important to develop trust and show some successes. In South
                    Africa, we didn't have a clear road-map of where we were going. We knew the
                    objective, but no one was certain how we would get there. In the end, we played
                    a catalytic role because the final decisions could only be reached by the people
                    living in the region. A lot of people in the U.S. didn't understand that. A lot
                    of Africans elsewhere didn't understand that. They expected the U.S. to impose a
                    solution. That can't be done. It does not work. The final resolution must be
                    left to agreements reached by the people living in the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the white South Africans you
                        were dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: They understood that current situation would have to change. But they
                    resisted because change was a frightening prospect. I don't think they were so
                    concerned with retribution as they were with the question of what could be done
                    with all the blacks. They were all poor, and there was no environment within
                    which they could prosper. That was a hazardous prospect and still remains so
                    today. Little progress has been made in raising the standard of living of the
                    blacks. They got freedom, but few economic benefits. That was the challenge that
                    the whites foresaw. Many of them of course were very privileged and very well
                    off. In the parliament, there was a member by the name of Helen Suzman, who was
                    the sole representative of the Progressive party. She was delightful and fought
                    for the abolition of apartheid all the time. The Liberal Party represented
                    mostly the English speaking population. The Afrikaner party represented most of
                    the whites and the power structure and then there was Helen Suzman who nipped at
                    their heels all the time. She was a very bold woman. She still lives, but has no
                    role any more in South Africa. She was one person I met in 1969 when I visited
                    South Africa on my orientation trip. Then I saw her periodically during my
                    assignment there. Eventually, she managed to get a couple of her colleagues
                    elected as well. The government finally had to give in to her because she became
                    so well known around the world. She saw Mandela many times while he was in
                    prison; she spent a lot of time with Winnie Mandela. She was prolific in her
                    edicts, which put more pressure on the government. Her participation gave the
                    black population and other anti-apartheid groups hope that someday, the
                    situation could change.</p>
                <p>The government behaved horrendously, torturing and putting Steve Biko and a few
                    others to death. Most of these atrocities were perpetrated by security
                    forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that the security forces were
                        operating on their own?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>NELSON: I don't think so. Perhaps at times they operated on their own because the
                    orders were probably written in such a way to give them great latitude. The
                    author of those orders may well have written so broadly because he - or they -
                    hoped that the security forces would conduct themselves as they did. The ANC
                    (African National Congress) had religiously followed non-violent methods until
                    about the 1970s. They struck to their principles for a long time, but their
                    approach was met with violence. Finally, they decided that their approach was
                    not working and began to fight violence with violence. They then also committed
                    some atrocities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did we do about Soweto?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Congressman Dingell came out and said that we would open a USIS office in
                    Soweto. And we did! It was an interesting experiment which was pretty
                    successful. I don't know that it made a lot of difference, but it became a
                    protected place where some of the restless youths could come and find shelter.
                    They would use the facility as a place to talk, and some may even have used the
                    library. I and others would go there periodically and meet with these young
                    people. It was an American presence right in that community. It became a small
                    chink in the apartheid armor.</p>
                <p>Most South Africans showed no concern about this USIS facility. Interestingly
                    enough, they were not strong enough to resist us, which suggests a lot about how
                    they saw their future. The general rule in the American community was when you
                    hosted a social function, you invited a mixture of guests - white, black,
                    colored, Indian, etc. I don't remember one official social occasion when we did
                    not host a mixture of guests. These occasions were therefore consistently
                    interesting. One would find white people sitting down with other communities,
                    getting addresses and phone numbers and having some frank discussions. I don't
                    know whether it led to anything, but the white people had experiences in our
                    homes which they never had before. One hopes that had some impact. There was a
                    readiness particularly in the black community to compromise, not to be
                    vindictive, to find a solution. There was the same sentiment in the white
                    community to a very substantial degree. But it was most noticeable among the
                    blacks, at least with those we came into contact. They were ready to work for
                    solutions, not demanding full satisfaction all at once, but to start a process
                    to dismantle apartheid. Some guests would call to say that they had been stopped
                    by a policeman who would suggest that they spend the evening at home. There was
                    a lot of harassment. The police knew whom we had invited because the invitations
                    were made telephonically, which were tapped. The security system worked
                    well.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>The regime did a lot of dumb things like arresting the wrong people at the wrong
                    times which only served to stir up the black population. At the request of the
                    ambassador, I did a lot of work exploring the various forces at work in South
                    Africa. One of the vocal groups was the religious one: there was the Dutch
                    Reformed; and the Anglican for the English speaking population; the black
                    population was all over the map. Some belonged to Dutch Reformed, some Anglican,
                    but most in mixed kinds of churches. So I had a very interesting time learning
                    about the religious sector in South Africa. I am not a very religious person. I
                    don't know much about churches, but I wandered into that community and met all
                    kinds of people like Bishop Desmond Tutu, an Anglican.</p>
                <p>In one of the townships outside Pretoria, there was a church with a nifty choir -
                    adults and children. For three Christmases, we invited them to our house. We
                    would also invite all of our South African friends - neighbors, officials, etc.
                    They would mix with the choir people. It was a very interesting mix, almost
                    emotional. The choir would sing and then mix with the whites at the party. The
                    blacks would take the initiative to make these contacts; the whites were very
                    hesitant. It worked like a charm; everyone had a an absolutely glorious
                    celebration. It was fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As DCM, did you have any problems with young officers who
                        were unboundedly against apartheid and who were probably quite vocal in
                        their objections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Of course. We had crusaders. The officers were pretty responsible, but
                    some of their wives were less inhibited. One or two of them tended to get into
                    trouble. We had a number of shanty towns which had sprung up as the blacks left
                    the rural areas to find employment in the city. These enclaves, built on empty
                    property owned by someone, would become huge and very unhealthful and also
                    became breeding grounds for the restless. The unemployment was very high. One of
                    the temporary solutions undertaken by the government was to bring in bull dozers
                    and wipe out these shanty towns. The inhabitants were forewarned. But one of the
                    wives would go to the shanty town scheduled for removal and sit down in front of
                    the bull dozer. There was a report that early one morning this deed had been
                    undertaken. It was not true, but I became very concerned because I thought that
                    the Foreign Ministry, having seen the report might well declare that family
                    persona non grata. I checked with the alleged perpetrator in the wee hours of
                    the morning and ascertained that she had been in bed all night long. Then at
                    5:30 a.m. I called the Foreign Minister and told him that if he heard that
                    story, it was not true. Since I was charg� at the time, I said that before he
                    took any action, I would be happy to talk to him. I repeated that the story was
                    just not true. The Foreign Minister, Pik Botha, was very able, but had a short
                    fuse. Fortunately, my call was enough to head off any action by the government.
                    I don't know that Botha would have invoked sanctions, but based on his history,
                    he might well have. The story had appeared in the early newscast which I had
                    heard. It may have been deliberately planted to cause trouble.</p>

                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Yes, we had one, Joe Segars, and his wife Elizabeth. This was a very
                    courageous couple. He was a commercial officer. I had met him during my year at
                    the Senior Seminar. For my research paper I had gone to Tokyo to examine its
                    pollution problem and what remedies the Japanese were undertaking, and he was a
                    commercial officer there. One day he came to me and told me that he had been
                    asked to go to Pretoria and asked me what my opinion was. I said that I didn't
                    really have an answer, I could not put myself in his shoes. This was a decision
                    that he had to reach on his own, but I did tell him what I knew about the
                    situation. I didn't think that the people would be tough on him personally, but
                    I was pretty sure that he would run into trouble wherever he went outside the
                    official environment. But the Segars, husband, wife and little son, went to
                    Pretoria. They got a comfortable house with a swimming pool in a white
                    community. I think it worked out pretty well. He had a job; I think it was
                    harder on his wife who stayed at home with her child. She has told some
                    wonderful stories, which I am sure were very distressing to her at the time they
                    took place. For example, she would answer the door bell and people would say:
                    “Is anyone home?” One day, she was out at the pool. She had requested a
                    repairman who treated her something awful. Working for a black woman was very
                    tough for this Afrikaner repairman. After a while, he told Elizabeth that the
                    repair job was done; she then asked him whether he could install a phone at
                    pool-side. She didn't really want that phone, but she just wanted the repairman
                    to suffer some more. He finally did it, but I am sure he was very unhappy. They
                    encountered prejudices wherever they went - e.g., traveling on the train. But I
                    thought they were very courageous. He eventually ended up as ambassador to the
                    Cape Verde islands.</p>
                <p>The experience that the Segars had in some ways illustrated the views of many
                    South Africans. Many of them opposed apartheid. They knew it was wrong. One of
                    the early chinks in the apartheid system came when the private schools began to
                    integrate; it was against the law, but they went ahead anyway. The Segars' son
                    went to one of these schools. There weren't many blacks in these private
                    schools, but there were some. The bastion of the South African educational
                    system - the medical school of Stellenbosch University - had black students.
                    They didn't live in the dormitories, but they did attend the school. The
                    university in Johannesburg was integrated. So the system was slowly - very
                    slowly - being broken down by the South Africans themselves. In 1969, on my
                    orientation trip, I went to a factory. There I was told that certain positions
                    were reserved for whites - these were all the skilled jobs. But I saw a black
                    man running a fork lift. I asked how that happened. I was told that he was a
                    “sweeper.” They obviously had found a way to dent the system.</p>

                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>NELSON: That is right. It was much more aggressive than the Reagan
                    administration. We did not think that sanctions would be very productive. It was
                    not an approach that would produce any positive results. We were concerned that
                    sanctions would cause more problems for the black population, as indeed they
                    did. My sense at the time was that time was not ripe for such an action because
                    it would cause more damage than good.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NELSON: No; at least not to me. The ambassador may have heard more
                    complaints.</p>
                <p>I can't remember any difficult problems we had with the South Africans about
                    sanctions. I don't know what discussion had taken place with them. That was the
                    ambassador's bailiwick, and I didn't really get involved. When I was charg�, I
                    did have a meeting with the South Africans about the Namibia negotiations. They
                    didn't enter those negotiations willingly. They felt they had to, but it
                    rankled. Don McHenry was the lead U.S. negotiator on South-West Africa. This
                    meeting included British, French and German representatives, as well as the
                    South African foreign minister. The president of South Africa, John Foster,
                    chaired the meeting. He had received a false report about McHenry and took the
                    opportunity to lambaste him. He called him a “reverse racist” and vindictive
                    with no integrity. No one spoke out to defend McHenry, despite the fact that all
                    the other delegations and the foreign minister knew the report that had set off
                    the president was untrue. So I had to respond to the president. I told him that
                    with all due respect, he was working from a false report and that Don McHenry
                    was one of the finest individuals on earth. I went on to say that when McHenry
                    said something, you could be assured that it was true. That was the only time
                    that I ran into criticism of what we were doing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left in 1979, what were your views about the
                        future of South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I was afraid for it. I was very attached to the country. We had made a
                    lot of friends, both whites and blacks. These were not enduring friendships,
                    although in some cases I wished we had kept in contact. I kept in touch
                    periodically with Helen Suzman, but that was about it. There was one black
                    minister with whom I wished we would have stayed in contact. He was the
                    religious leader of one of the Cape Town's townships. Just before we left, we
                    were going to pay him a visit to say good-bye. I was pulled off to do something
                    else. The situation in Cape Town was very unstable with riots and stone throwing
                    incidents. It was not a secure situation, but my wife went ahead and met with
                    the minister and his wife. There were sad goodbyes. The minister gave her a
                    blanket for me. It was a cheap cotton blanket with an African design on it and I
                    still have it. I became very attached to it.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>I thought that we could try to influence both sides to reach a mutually
                    acceptable solution, but in the final analysis it was their dispute that only
                    they could resolve. Most of the South Africans wanted a solution and it was up
                    to them to find it. It may well have been a solution that we had not anticipated
                    or planned for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left South Africa in 1979. What was next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I was assigned as diplomat-in-residence at Arizona State University for
                    one year. I left there in June, 1980. The university was in Tempe, close to
                    Phoenix.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the diplomat-in-residence program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: At that time, there were about 40 diplomats-in-residence. It proved an
                    opportunity to re-familiarization with the U.S. The main contact of course was
                    the academic community, which is a special part of our society. It was an
                    opportunity to learn while teaching. If I had to do it again, I think I would
                    have done more teaching than I did in 1979-80. Many academic institutions and
                    certainly Arizona State was not really prepared for us. They thought it was a
                    good idea, but really didn't quite know how to utilize these Foreign Service
                    officers. So we lost a lot of time while the institution worked out this
                    problem. In the first semester, I did not have a course to teach. In the second
                    semester, I was given a small seminar, consisting of about six juniors and
                    seniors. We discussed South Africans affairs and I thought it was very neat. It
                    was a lot of fun. The students were a very mixed bag, but they all were very
                    stimulating.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>The most exciting experience that I had was when I had to opportunity to travel
                    throughout Arizona to the community colleges. It was fun to be at Arizona State
                    and to contribute to their academic efforts. My presence in Arizona was noted by
                    academics, and I was invited to go to various community colleges. In fact, this
                    activity snow-balled. The community colleges were just becoming an important
                    part of Arizona's academic efforts. My appearances there gave me a real
                    opportunity to become acquainted with Arizonians from all walks of life. The
                    community colleges were popping up all over the state. The student bodies tended
                    to be small, but they consisted of people, young and old, who attended for a
                    purpose. They did not attend college because that was what one was supposed to
                    do. They had clear academic pursuits either to specialize in one subject or
                    another or to clear up a bad high school record or just to get an associate
                    degree which was required in their particular profession. They knew exactly what
                    they wanted to do and where they were going. There were a lot of more senior
                    people who were pursuing continuing education opportunities. They were
                    interested in just learning more. So the community colleges had a large mixture
                    age-wise, ethnically, and by economic groups. They were very stimulating and
                    quite different from university students. At Arizona State, there were 50,000
                    students, 90% of them commuters. I had never experienced that type of
                    environment. There were parking lots all over the place reaching to the edge of
                    the desert. It was a very fine institution, but the motivation of the student
                    body - all young people - was very different than that found in the community
                    colleges. So I enjoyed the community colleges more than I did Arizona State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your discussions of South Africa received?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I had realized that people in the world get stirred up by a lot of
                    things. That may have not been typical of the Vietnam war, but in the case of
                    South Africa, segments of our society - certain age groups, particularly college
                    students - get worked up about certain issues, but they do not do it in large
                    numbers. I am referring to that 10% that makes a difference. The rest of the
                    people have other matters on their mind more closely related to their everyday
                    living. That is the way it was on campus. There were some students who were
                    interested, but they were by no means the majority. When I would give a talk on
                    South Africa, all those who were engaged - pro and con - were all there. Some
                    wanted to learn, some just wanted to make trouble. So there was a lot of give
                    and take, including some unpleasantries. On a campus of 50,000 students, I might
                    get 500 to listen to my lecture; they were the only ones that were
                    interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a black student movement at Arizona State when
                        you were there and was that involved in the South Africa issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>NELSON: There were a couple of black students in my class. They were very
                    level-headed, very interested, intellectuals and not emotional. I also had an
                    American Indian in our seminar, a Hispanic, a couple of Anglos and a few who
                    took the course just because they had to fulfill some academic requirements. But
                    we did not have a black student movement.</p>
                <p>The major issue which took center stage while I was at Arizona State was the
                    occupation of our embassy in Tehran. We had a lot of Iranian students on campus.
                    That issue attracted attention, but again only by a minority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself explaining the rights of diplomats
                        and diplomatic property and things like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Not a lot. On occasion, I was asked about those matters, but it was not a
                    hot subject by any means. I did spend some time talking to students who were
                    interested in the Foreign Service. I suggested to them what they might want to
                    study if they wanted to take the exams.</p>
                <p>When the Iranian problem arose, there were a lot of questions. I was asked what
                    the likely scenario might be and how it might be resolved; no one knew the
                    answer, but there was considerable speculation. There were some who were
                    interested in the origins of our difficulties. The media was generally the main
                    source of information for the campus community. I should note that the majority
                    of the student body probably did not know that I existed. As I said there were
                    50,000 students; and one got lost in the campus in a hurry. So there was only a
                    small group who knew of my presence. But it was a great year for us. My wife and
                    I enjoyed it tremendously; she got a job as a secretary to the head of the
                    biology department. So she was on campus every day. We become acquainted with a
                    number of the faculty members and a handful of students. And then, as I said, I
                    developed contacts all over the state through the community colleges. Some of
                    these institutions were so new that they were still operating out of trailers;
                    they had no buildings finished yet. There was real energy in these community
                    colleges; they were bound and determined to make their mark in the academic
                    community. The faculty was mainly young and it had that pioneering spirit one
                    often sees in new endeavors. It was just neat!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your year in academia, did you keep in touch with
                        the Department about your next assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>NELSON: I never really did make the transition from being a good soldier doing
                    what one was ordered to do to politicking on the next assignment. So I didn't
                    lobby for my next assignment, but somewhere along the line, while at Arizona
                    State, someone suggested that I be assigned to Carlyle as the Department's
                    representative to the Army War College faculty. When asked, I said that it
                    sounded interesting, but I asked whether the commandant had been asked. I
                    thought that he might have some say. I suggested that my wife and I visit the
                    College and see what it was like and whether the commandant thought we would fit
                    in. So we did that and hit it off with the faculty, even though this was quite a
                    different atmosphere from any to which we were accustomed. The State Department
                    representative is not just a faculty member at the Army War College; he or she
                    is a deputy commandant out-ranking the other deputy commandant. Of course, I
                    couldn't take command of anything, but we really had status. I am sure that the
                    military might have some adjustment problems, but this had been a practice for
                    many years, so that we were not breaking new ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Carlyle from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I was there from August 1980 to June 1984 - four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What purpose in the military academic hierarchy does the
                        Army College serve? What does it do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: As I understood it, the Army War College was to provide a family
                    experience for soldiers who had not had any great opportunities for that. From
                    the group who attended, it was assumed that the leadership of the Army would
                    come, as well as other services that attended. The job was to familiarize them
                    and become involved in the society which they were supposed to defend. Up to the
                    time they arrived in Carlyle, they had been only taught how to kill and break
                    things. This year was an opportunity to tell them why they had done what they
                    had done. It was very good. It was a good place for younger officers and
                    families to become re-acquainted with their families and their colleagues. Of
                    course, we had war games, using computers and other fancy equipment, and
                    academic studies. The stress was on learning about the history of their country,
                    the world and languages, politics, economics, mathematics - all sorts of
                    information that was not strictly related to military duties. It was an advanced
                    liberal arts education. There was a lot on international affairs which was my
                    responsibility. We had some very useful and informative trips to places like the
                    UN and places like that. Good speakers were brought in from Washington and from
                    all over the globe to spend time with the students. I didn't teach any courses,
                    although I participated in some of the seminars. I was working on giving a
                    course on the media and the military; I developed an outline for such a course
                    which was a subject dear and close to the heart of the military which is still
                    an issue today - which I don't think will ever be solved to satisfaction of both
                    sides. But it never came to fruition.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>We had about 30 international students - generals and colonels. I worked a lot
                    with them. I traveled with them and brought a lot of people from Washington to
                    speak to them. I worked on curriculum development and other miscellany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the students coping with the trauma of the
                        post-Vietnam experience and a powerful Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I think they were not trying to change their basic orientation. I do
                    think they were trying to add to their understanding of the world. There was
                    some anti-military sentiment still in the U.S., sadly misguided, I might add.
                    What we had in Carlyle was in general a cross-section of the upper intellectual
                    strata of the U.S. We had a bunch of smart people. They really wanted to learn.
                    They realized they didn't have the whole picture. Most were quite open-minded.
                    It was an outstanding group of American citizens. I was very humbled and proud
                    to be among them.</p>
                <p>The College would annually bring in plain citizens from various part of the
                    country - at considerable expense, I might add - to be heard by the officers and
                    to listen to what the Army people had to say. They would live with the students
                    for a week. These people were influential in their communities. The Army hoped
                    that they would leave with a positive experience, which they would communicate
                    to their communities. Most of the time they left in a positive frame of mind. A
                    few did not. On my travels, I found a couple of people who were really down on
                    the military. I invited them to join for a one week visit. They did come and
                    were refreshed by their experience and reevaluated their positions. They found
                    out, as I did, that these officers were quite representative of a cross-section
                    of our society. They were American folks who happened to be in the military. Of
                    course, there were some things that the military missed as the civilians missed
                    some things about the military. John Shalikashvili was one of our students. He
                    became the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>It was a mind opening and a mind bending experience for all of us. I thought it
                    was excellent. Some of my colleagues who have been at other military
                    institutions do not speak as glowingly about their experiences as I do about
                    mine. I think they all learned something, but I found it highly valuable. It
                    reinforced my view that military officers are the same as the rest of us, just
                    doing a special job.</p>

                    to make them understand the nature of a diplomat. Our appreciation for them was

                <p>NELSON: Not so much from the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs which had
                    nominal jurisdiction over all personnel assigned to military colleges. It had
                    many fish to fry. I should say that the word “college” is really misapplied to
                    these military schools. They are really graduate education. There was some
                    thought given to change the name, but once a word becomes part of the lexicon,
                    change is very hard.</p>
                <p>Chet Crocker was the Assistant Secretary for Africa. He had a high level meeting
                    with some foreign representatives on, I think, South Africa which he held at
                    Carlyle. My wife hosted the delegates. We had a couple of very good Foreign
                    Service students. They mixed with the military quite well. I think that
                    attendance at a military school is not everybody's cup of tea, but I think for
                    most FSOs it is a good experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it also true that at least in our generation, most
                        of the officers had served in the military, often in combat. So we had a
                        good appreciation of what the military does and thinks. We know for example
                        that the military is run by the top sergeants. We also know that many of the
                        officers and non-commissioned officers are quite capable. Now we may have a
                        situation in which most FSOs have not been in the military; they may
                        therefore had very little, if any contact with the military and could easily
                        have formed mis-impressions of the military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I think you are right, and that mis-impression happens much too often. If
                    they would only stop and think, they would understand that they may not have the
                    complete picture. But of course that is true for all of us. All of us have
                    prejudices stemming from lack of knowledge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You finished at Carlyle in 1984. What happened next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: We left the Army War College with great regret. My wife had been
                    diagnosed with lung cancer before we left. She was operated on there in Carlyle
                    by a fantastic surgeon. She was well on the way to recovery when we left. She
                    was loved by that community. She was a real part of it. She had been a great
                    help to the families. She is that kind of person. People sought her out for
                    counseling and advice. There were a lot of domestic difficulties and problems.
                    She was a good listener and then gave her counsel. So she was very highly
                    regarded in that community. She loved it there.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>We didn't really know much about cancer and really didn't know what questions to
                    ask. Nobody really told us much. For example, we did not ask whether any
                    remnants of the cancerous cells remained. If there were, the chances were good
                    that it would recur in some other organ. We didn't know that.</p>
                <p>We came back to Washington. I didn't have another assignment. I was put on the
                    promotion panels and that was very interesting. But my wife suddenly developed a
                    brain tumor. So we started dealing with this problem day by day. Steroids helped
                    to keep the tumor under control for a while. She underwent radiation therapy.
                    She did ok for a while. She had people visit her and got around. She was even
                    able to attend our daughter's wedding in California. That was a big event. We
                    thought she might have licked it. But came January and she started to decline,
                    dying in June, 1985. Most of the time I spent with her. When the promotion board
                    work was finished, the Department just let me be. It didn't bother me, and I was
                    able to spend time with her until her death.</p>
                <p>At that time, I was asked whether I would go as ambassador to Swaziland. I was
                    heart-broken that my wife could not have shared that with me. It was very hard.
                    I told the Department that I needed a little time to consider the offer. I
                    talked to my children and told them that I thought that I could not do the job
                    without their mother. My daughter asked me what her mother might say. That was
                    obvious, and I accepted the offer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Swaziland from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I went in the fall of 1985 and left in the fall of 1988.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little about 1985 Swaziland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Things were coming unglued in South Africa. Mozambique was in
                    considerable disarray. The Portuguese had left, and a civil war had broken out.
                    Those were Swaziland's neighbors. So Swaziland had to host a lot of refugees and
                    some freedom fighter groups who used Swaziland as a base. They did not make the
                    white South Africans very happy. Under pressure from their shareholders it
                    became a haven for businessmen who had conducted their affairs in South Africa.
                    For example, Coca Cola moved its South African regional headquarters to Mbabane.
                    Swaziland at the time had a population of less than one million people. It
                    gained a little from this business migration.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>Swaziland is a country populated by only one tribe and, therefore, does not have
                    tribal conflicts. The Swazi tribe is an off-shoot of the Zulus. They both speak
                    the same language. It is a monarchy, a very tradition-bound society which is
                    highly dependent on chiefs for leadership. The population is polygamous with a
                    few exceptions. Its basic industry is farming with a large number of South
                    African farmers managing the plantations of pineapples and other citrus fruits.
                    It also had a large timber industry run by South African concerns. It had a very
                    good reforestation program. They grow pine trees even though they are not
                    indigenous to Swaziland. Swaziland produced paper pulp. There was some industry.
                    In general, Swaziland did reasonably well economically even though the economy
                    was totally dependent on South Africa.</p>
                <p>Swaziland generally stayed out of trouble. It was a convenience to South Africa.
                    It was a convenience to rebel groups as well. It was something akin to
                    Switzerland in a way. It had good relationships with its neighbors. There was
                    probably not an overriding reason for us to have representation there. But that
                    was true for so many other countries as well. The only good reason I can think
                    of is that it gave me an opportunity for an ambassadorship.</p>
                <p>The people were very kind and very accessible. They were very secretive about
                    their odd traditions. Swaziland had a parliament with elections of a sort. There
                    were political groups which vied with each other in peaceful ways.</p>
                <p>It was a pleasant experience. We had a small assistance program with which my
                    current wife was involved. She was a contractor in the community radio
                    business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it considered a front line state? Did the ANC or
                        comparable groups use Swaziland as a base for raids into South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Swaziland was considered a front-line state, but not aggressively so. It
                    didn't like to be part of the South African problem. The South African
                    government, probably with some justification, lodged protests on a couple of
                    occasions that Swaziland was being used by raiders. But I don't think Swaziland
                    was ever a major base of operations. We didn't have any South African raids in
                    Swaziland to secure the border areas. There probably were agents of South Africa
                    who did their job, but we didn't have any public interventions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Mozambique conflict? Who was fighting whom
                        in 1985?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>NELSON: I am not sure that I remember. It was mostly a power struggle with very
                    little ideology. There were people who wanted to overthrow the socialist
                    government. Machel and Chissano were supported by South Africa and by Southern
                    Rhodesia. So there was an external influence. Machel was not reluctant to accept
                    aid from the Soviets or the Chinese. It was a messy, undefinable conflict. As a
                    matter of fact, my wife and I were going to visit Mozambique to visit the great
                    game park. But we canceled because the trip was considered a little too
                    hazardous. It could have been done, but Mozambique was too unstable to take the
                    risk. It got worse after 1988. Bill De Pree was our ambassador in Maputo. He
                    survived without any damage. My wife and I did drive to Maputo to visit the De
                    Prees. When we tried to get back to Swaziland, the Mozambique army stopped us at
                    a road block they had just thrown up. With great glee, they forced us to empty
                    our car. Everything had to be taken out. We had tennis racquets and balls. These
                    soldiers forced us to show them how to use them. So we stood in the middle of
                    the highway hitting the ball back and forth. We followed their orders without
                    complaint. Finally, the officer in charge released us, and we had to repack all
                    our goods which had been strewed on the highway. One of the soldiers finally
                    couldn't stand it anymore, and he came to give us a helping hand. Mozambique at
                    the time was not a very stable place. People had real trouble on the highways.
                    We didn't, but others did and so traveling in Mozambique was somewhat of a
                    risk.</p>
                <p>The capital of Swaziland is Mbabane. It is about 5,000-6,000 feet high. The
                    climate was very comfortable. The country has lowlands, which are tropical and
                    hot. Some of that land was very good for citrus fruit planting. The higher
                    elevations were very good for pineapple. The forests were also in the
                    mountains.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Everybody was accessible, the foreign minister, the first private
                    secretaries of the ministries. We probably knew all the ministers and their
                    first secretaries as well as people at lower echelons who had some influence. We
                    had good access to the prime minister's office. We did a lot of waiting. You
                    would make an appointment for a certain hour and then wait and wait. To see the
                    king was big deal with all sorts of ceremonial trappings. I think there was a
                    lot of influence exercised by older hangers-on in the royal house. They may have
                    been family members, but there were others as well. All of them had been at the
                    court with the king's father - King Sobhuza - who had been put on the throne by
                    the British. He had seventy wives and an untold number of children. So there
                    were a lot of princes in Swaziland. King Mswati III was in a British boarding
                    school when the British decided to put him on the throne. He was going to attend
                    Sandhurst but never made it that far. He was very young when he assumed the
                    throne and that I think made him quite receptive to the council of elders that
                    his father had collected. These people were very conservative and
                    traditionalist. They had no inclination to change society, even if they had
                    known how.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>But the king was accessible. It took some work, but it could be done. Seeing him
                    was not necessarily useful. I think the more important objective was to find the
                    person or persons who were advising him on the subject we wanted to discuss. I
                    don't think I ever figured that power structure out. Perhaps my diplomatic
                    colleagues were more skilled at this than I was, but it always had me stumped.
                    So seeing the king was really not of much use. On occasions, he would summon me
                    when he wanted something. These were material things. He was building an
                    enormous new palace. We had some reservations about that expenditure of public
                    money. We had an assistance program. It didn't seem quite right that Swaziland
                    should spend so much money on a palace when its basic needs were going unmet.
                    That really bugged us. His majesty wanted to furnish the palace. He had gotten
                    some quotes from an Italian manufacturer which he thought were outrageous. He
                    asked me whether I could help. I suggested to Washington that a contract be
                    arranged with some North Carolina furniture maker, but no one was interested. So
                    I never gave the king an answer and he never followed up. There were a couple of
                    requests like that.</p>
                <p>When the king was crowned, Maureen Reagan came as the president's representative.
                    That was an interesting time. She was very good. She may have been difficult in
                    some ways, but she was an outstanding representative. The king got a big kick
                    out of her. I think she enjoyed her trip. Of course she had her special aircraft
                    and had a lot of staff with her. It was a big event for little Swaziland, not to
                    mention our tiny embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have heard that Maureen Regan was quite firm, but also
                        very smart and well prepared. She was one that should not be crossed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: That is right, but she wasn't bad. When things were going well, I was
                    “Harvey;” when she wasn't happy, I was “Mr. Ambassador.” So I knew right away
                    when trouble was brewing. I think she enjoyed the trip, although I am not sure
                    that she was convinced it was worth all the time and expense involved. I wasn't
                    either. But it was a nice visit. We had a wonderful evening at the residence
                    with all of the staff. She was very gracious. I had collected for some reason a
                    number of cheap wind-up toys, kangaroos that jumped, cars that go around, etc.
                    She asked that I bring them out and she put them on the coffee table, and she
                    tried to get them moving all at one time. She stayed late into the night and the
                    staff had to be there because none of them could leave before her. She was
                    having a wonderful time. She was a very good sport. She did all of the official
                    mandatory things that were expected. It was fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were still involved in “constructive engagement” at the
                        time. We were quite active in southern Africa. Did Swaziland ever play any
                        role in our efforts?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>NELSON: No, I don't think so. I don't remember any contribution that Swaziland
                    made to the process. They were pretty much in the pockets of South Africa. There
                    was a railroad which cut through Swaziland on the way to Maputo, which was a
                    port. It was essentially a South African enterprise. That was interesting
                    because South Africa did not have very good relations with Mozambique. But
                    business was business. We were not too happy about that development because the
                    railroad was being built by South Africa and it had the potential of interfering
                    with the sanctions we had imposed. That was just an example of the Swazis
                    playing the South African game. On the other hand, they really didn't have much
                    choice. The Swazis really couldn't afford to participate in the pressure that we
                    and others were trying to apply to South Africa. They weren't really interested
                    in our policies they were getting along fine. And we didn't really pressure them
                    to change. I did encourage them to take certain steps, but we didn't insist.
                    Some time they would help, such as a vote in the UN. But they didn't help us in
                    any significant way as far as South Africa was concerned.</p>
                <p>While in Mbabane, I remarried. My new wife was an Australian. She was born and
                    raised in Melbourne. Her mother was a radio drama script writer. She wrote for
                    some Australian radio series. When my wife was about seven years old, she asked
                    her mother whether she couldn't write her into one of her episodes. She liked to
                    act and wanted to have the opportunity to try radio. Her mother did and that was
                    her start into radio. She pursued that career both as an actress and a writer
                    and as a producer. After that came television. But during all that work she
                    pursued academic studies. Her first love was music, particularly opera.. She
                    joined a traveling university musical group who put on musicals around
                    Australia. She has a gorgeous voice even today. She says that if she could live
                    her life over again; she would have concentrated on opera. She was married and
                    had two children; her husband deserted her leaving her to support the family. I
                    should mention that she was not a good student in the usual subjects. In fact
                    she failed high school. But she worked until she got into a university which
                    opened all sorts of horizons. She became a teacher in a very good girls' private
                    school. She applied for a scholarship to go to England or for a Fulbright
                    scholarship to teach in the U.S. She was accepted in England and for the
                    Fulbright program. She really didn't like what she had heard about the U.S. She
                    wondered why that was since she had never been there. So she accepted the
                    Fulbright scholarship.</p>
                <p>She taught in a high school in Cincinnati. Her kids were with her, and she still
                    had to support the whole family. She returned to Australia as was required by
                    the Fulbright program for a couple of years. Then she returned to the U.S. I am
                    not quite clear why she did that. She didn't think much of our education system.
                    It was not nearly as demanding on the students as were the Australian schools.
                    She did return to teach, but at one point she became fed up with our system
                    because she was being paid 2/3 of the salary that male teachers were earning.
                    She just couldn't accept that discrimination.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>While teaching, she also did some part time work for radio and TV stations. When
                    she became available for full time work, she was contacted by one of the
                    Cincinnati TV stations. She became involved in their science program. That
                    really started her career. Somewhere along the line, she was asked whether she
                    would be interested in helping the assistance program in Kenya which was using
                    radio to disseminate information. She accepted and then stuck with the
                    assistance program, finally ending up in Swaziland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much work did you do trying to get the Swazis to vote
                        with us in the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Quite a bit. We always had one vote or another for which we wanted as
                    much support as we could gather. As I said, they were very helpful when they
                    could. If the vote would cause them trouble with South Africa, then they
                    wouldn't play. They had to worry about their own situation first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of an American community in Swaziland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Very small. There were Britishers and South Africans and Southern
                    Rhodesians. We still have friends in those communities, but these were people
                    who came to Swaziland - or their parents did - and just stayed even after they
                    retired. One of our friends who was a South African lady and her husband started
                    a weaving shop. We have some very fine drapes which came from her. They left
                    South Africa because they just couldn't stand the apartheid policies of the
                    government. They are now in their 80s and still living in Swaziland. They also
                    manufactured some of the drapes in the Kennedy Center. Their son became a member
                    of the Swazi parliament for a number of years. Then there were few other South
                    Africans who followed that path because they couldn't stand the racist policies
                    in their country. But the white community in Swaziland was not very large.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the diplomatic community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: Very small. The Israelis had a mission - they would establish missions
                    wherever they could because they were not welcomed in a lot of countries. The
                    French were there as were the British. The Dutch had representation as did the
                    Mozambicans, the South Africans as well as one or two others. There was a
                    tradition in the diplomatic community to have a weekly luncheon. They were very
                    boring. When one of us would leave, we would be presented with a small silver
                    plate signed by all of the other foreign ambassadors. There was plenty of room
                    on the plate for all of the signatures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major issues during your tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>NELSON: I don't remember any. There may have been some incidents, but nothing
                    worth remembering. I think one of the problems was that we were too damn
                    comfortable there and too well accepted. We could deal with any problem quite
                    amicably and quickly. So I don't think we had any major issues while I was
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Swaziland in 1988. What was next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NELSON: I was planning to retire since I was going to be 65 at the end of
                    January, 1989. I had not received any forward assignment - that is one of the
                    hazard of being an ambassador because if you don't have a new assignment within
                    90 days, you have to retire. But one day, as I was walking into the cafeteria,
                    some one asked me whether I would be interested in going back to the UN for the
                    General Assembly meeting. I discussed it with my wife and agreed that I should
                    go to NY.</p>
                <p>So the last three months of 1988 were spent at the UN. That was great fun. Vernon
                    Walters was our representative to the UN. He was a very smart and a very nice
                    man. Maureen Reagan also became part of the delegation. One of the princes of
                    the Swaziland royal family came. He was anxious to accomplish something so that
                    he could go home with good press. I could only think of a photo opportunity with
                    someone prominent. So he wanted to be in a picture with Maureen Reagan. Then he
                    would also have his picture taken with General Walters. Walters was always
                    willing to accommodate people who had requests like that. So I arranged for the
                    prince to have his picture taken with each of them. I asked Maureen whether she
                    would have breakfast with the Swazis. I knew that her schedule was filled, but
                    she readily agreed. Then we went to the Waldorf Astoria which was the American
                    representative's residence and had the pictures taken there with Walters. The
                    Swazis were very happy. It was very nice. I saw Walters about a year later, and
                    he said that he had never gotten a copy of the photograph. He had remembered,
                    what a mind!</p>
                <p>My wife was writing a textbook at the time, so that New York was an ideal
                    assignment. She set up in an apartment on the 35th floor of some building,
                    within walking distance of the UN. The book was quite successful. So it was a
                    very interesting time. The job was the same as before, trying to deal with 50
                    delegations.</p>
                <p>Then I retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What have you done since retirement in 1989?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>NELSON: I really retired from foreign affairs. I became involved with my wife on
                    her work. We bought a house in Great Falls and we spent time working on that. I
                    had a wood-shop there. We had a garden to tend. My wife traveled and I went with
                    her. We re-established face-to-face contacts with the children. I was asked to
                    take on another three months at the UN in 1990 and we did that. I was getting
                    pretty good at buttonholing delegates in the lounge. By this time, I also knew
                    some of the African delegates from previous General Assemblies. That was very
                    important because it takes so long to become acquainted with these delegations.
                    Knowing some delegates made the work so much easier. I thought that knowing some
                    would make me much more effective. I could get to them rather easily and was
                    able to explain the U.S. position and ask for their support. We drove to New
                    York with all the stuff we needed for our three months stay. That last
                    assignment was a nice finale.</p>
                <p>I did think that it would have been good had the Department asked me to attend
                    the 1991 assembly meeting as well. By this time, I would have known the
                    delegations well. It would have been useful. I suggested that a younger officer
                    should accompany so that he or she would have become acquainted with the African
                    delegations and the process so that a new generation could have been trained.
                    But the Department doesn't work that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that brings us to the end. Harvey, thanks very
                        much for your contribution.</hi>
