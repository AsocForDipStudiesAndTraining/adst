                <p>JOHN SYLVESTER, JR.</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Jeff Broadwater </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 6, 1993</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Mr. Sylvester's office, in Raleigh, North Carolina. Mr.
                        Sylvester, could I begin by just asking you to say something about your
                        early life and background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Well, my family was all a Navy family. My father graduated in the
                    Class of '26 from the Naval Academy. And my mother's father was Admiral Harry E.
                    Yarnell, who was later commander in chief of the Asiatic Fleet in 1936-39, when
                    my father was his flag lieutenant (a fine bit of nepotism).</p>
                <p>But my first exposure to life overseas was as a child, living in Shanghai,
                    Tsingtao, Baguio and Hong Kong, between 1936 and '39. I saw then the beginning
                    of the Sino-Japanese War, and thus the beginning of World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would have been fairly young during World War II, but
                        where were you during the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: My father went off to the South Pacific and fought in some of the
                    naval battles off Guadalcanal, and then, later, in the Leyte Gulf Battle. I
                    lived during the war years in Newport, Rhode Island, where my grandfather had
                    retired and my mother stayed close.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you went to Williams College after the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Yes, I went to Phillips Academy, Andover, and then went to Williams,
                    where I was a history major and wrote a thesis on Communism and the Spanish
                    Civil War.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>When I graduated in '52, I enlisted in the Army and went off as a rifleman in the
                    Korean War, arriving in Korea, I think it was March '53, where I saw the last
                    four months of the war. We were on the central front, first in the so-called
                    Iron Triangle near Chorwon, and then, in the very last days of the war, at an
                    area called the Oxreider Skyline Drive, which was just west of the so-called
                    Punchbowl. I was on line the last day of the war. In fact, the worst we had it
                    was the last two hours of the war, when the Chinese forces opposite us dumped
                    all the remaining ammunition on us. And it was a very eerie feeling, because
                    we'd been called back earlier in the day, and told the war would end that day.
                    We went back to our bunkers, and then, suddenly, at eight o'clock sharp, the
                    Chinese opened up with all their remaining artillery and mortar ammunition. That
                    lasted until about quarter of ten, and it began to trail off. Then, at ten
                    o'clock, it was dead silence, and it was a very eerie feeling.</p>
                <p>My assistant platoon sergeant, somebody told me, was the last American killed in
                    the war. He was hit during that bombardment and died shortly after the war
                    ended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you an officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: No, I was a private, later made sergeant in the days after the
                    war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the benefit of the transcriber, did you say
                        Oxrider?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: It was called Oxreider; I think it was named after somebody. It was a
                    very mountainous part in eastern Korea, just south of the famous Diamond
                    Mountains. And it was one ridge line after another. I remember getting up at
                    dawn, as you do, of course; you could see little cooking-fire smoke plumes
                    coming out of the front of the mountains, one after another, north of us, which
                    indicated that the Chinese forces had dug through the mountains. Very extensive
                    tunneling evidenced that, at that stage of the war, it would have been
                    impossible to have attacked on the ground in that area, going to the north. It
                    was a stalemated, kind of World-War-I-type war at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you become interested in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Well, it was very vague. Like a lot of my colleagues, I think I knew
                    very little of what it was about, except that it dealt with foreign countries. I
                    probably confused it with the Foreign Legion or such. But because of my
                    childhood and my war years in the Far East, I just had a general interest in the
                    outside world. It seemed like a profession that would give you travel, give you
                    new experiences. And that was certainly true.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you joined the Foreign Service in 1955, is that
                        correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wanted to ask you about that, because that is right
                        after the heyday of McCarthyism and the purge of the China hands and all
                        that. What was it like to enter the Foreign Service in 1955, after all that
                        controversy had developed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: My group of twenty officers was the first class that had been pulled
                    together for the entering officers' course for many years, because of the
                    McCarthy effect. It was interesting, we were an older group. I was one of the
                    younger, actually, at twenty-five. One of the guys was a man named John Reed, a
                    very bright guy, who had trouble getting in the Foreign Service because his
                    namesake uncle was buried in the Kremlin wall. We had John Foster Dulles come to
                    speak to us, because it was an event having that group together. There were some
                    very able guys in the group. I guess the one who was most successful was
                    Ambassador Richard Murphy, who went on to become a Near East specialist and is
                    still prominent in that field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think of Dulles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: The only personal contact we had was that one talk he gave shortly
                    before he resigned and then, of course, died of cancer. He was an articulate
                    man. I had no first-hand knowledge of him, except he certainly did have kind of
                    a primness about him. And the accounts you read in the history books, the image
                    that those books conveyed, seemed warranted by that one short look I had of
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He comes across as a kind of dour, stern Calvinist in some
                        of the history books. Is that unfair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Yes, he seemed a stern man of intense conviction. But, again, my look
                    at him was too shallow to make a judgment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know any of the members of that older generation
                        of Far Eastern specialists—John Patton Davies or John Carter Vincent? Did
                        you have any contact with any of those folks?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SYLVESTER: I had close contact with one, a fine man named John Emerson, who was
                    the deputy chief of mission at the embassy in Tokyo when I was stationed as a
                    young officer there. He worked for Ambassador Reischauer. And John had been a
                    China hand. He'd come in the occupation at the early stages and had been sent by
                    General MacArthur's headquarters out to Sugamo Prison to arrange the release of
                    the political prisoners who were there, which included the Communists. And this
                    became one thing on his record that was a black mark in the eyes of the McCarthy
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That name is just vaguely familiar. What happened to
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Well, Emerson survived. It certainly didn't help his career, but he
                    was a talented, very decent, bright man, a good linguist, good in Japanese, many
                    talents, good piano, a friendly guy. But you could see the tracks of the
                    McCarthy experience. Some Japanese right-wingers complained about him being
                    assigned to the embassy, and used to write letters to the ambassador, and I
                    think probably the secretary of state, complaining about his presence, as if
                    somehow this were polluting American policy. But fortunately for John, he
                    survived. But he never got his embassy; he never became an ambassador himself,
                    and I understand this was a direct result of the McCarthy criticism that still
                    lingered in the halls of Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My impression of the ones who survived was that they
                        either weren't promoted or they were transferred out of the Far East and
                        maybe sent to Europe or someplace.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Well, John Emerson survived, he came back to Japan, he got the senior
                    position: he just didn't get an embassy of his own, because of the confirmation
                    process in the Senate. Apparently one or two of the right-wing senators had
                    indicated that they would make an issue of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I need to check one more spelling. You said that was
                        Sagamu Prison?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Yes, I think it's... I'm embarrassed to say I forget the Japanese
                    spelling. I think it's Sugamo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was close. Some of these Japanese names may give the
                        transcriber some trouble, so I want to try...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: That was a major Japanese prison, and then, after our occupation
                    began, the war criminals were imprisoned there, and the trial of General Toj and
                    the others took place there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel threatened or intimidated as a young Foreign
                        Service officer by the McCarthyites and by what some of your predecessors
                        had been through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: No, I never did. I think it lingered on in the older people. But by
                    the time I entered the Foreign Service, '55, McCarthy was dead and it was
                    changing. It was, however, a conservative period in the United States.
                    Anti-Communism was still the principal motif of our foreign policy. And you
                    could see that in the way that Ambassador Douglas MacArthur II carried out his
                    embassy in Japan in those years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it that you came to be assigned to Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: It was a slightly disillusioning process. When I came in the Foreign
                    Service, our class was asked where they would like to go. And I actually wanted
                    to go to Europe; I'd never been to Europe. But the person who spoke to us said
                    that we all had to understand that Europe was the most popular and your chances
                    of not getting it were fairly strong. So I thought carefully and decided to put
                    down on my so-called wish list my second choice, which was to go back to the Far
                    East. And then everyone who asked for Europe went there. And me, being
                    Sylvester, I was almost at the end of those, as they announced the assignment
                    posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were made alphabetically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Yes, they read them out alphabetically to our group of twenty. They
                    got down to me and said I was assigned to Pusan, Korea. I'd just come back from
                    Pusan a year before, which was a real dump then. It's actually a very
                    interesting place, and I was there months ago.</p>
                <p>But I was not happy about that, so I went in, rather crestfallen, to Personnel
                    the next day, just to report in that I would be ready to go off to Pusan when
                    the course ended. And they said, “Oops. Sylvester, Sylvester... Your assignment
                    has been changed and you're going to Hong Kong.”</p>
                <p>I was happy, and I went over and started basic Chinese language and took that for
                    about a month and a half.</p>
                <p>I went back one day to Personnel, to report in, and they said, “Oops. Sylvester.
                    Your assignment has been changed. You're going to Okinawa.”</p>
                <p>Well, in the end, I went to Yokohama.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>So I was slightly disillusioned at how government worked by then. But it was
                    probably a good lesson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever figure out what was going on with those
                        assignment changes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: It was just the normal Mixmaster effect of Personnel's assignment
                    needs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now your first post was in Yokohama, at the consulate
                        there. What were your duties there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: It was a typical consulate. I did the full range of consular and
                    administrative work. I started as a citizenship and passport officer, which was
                    dealing then with the remaining cases of Nisei who'd been sent back to Japan
                    either during the war or after the war and were trying to regain their American
                    citizenship. It was kind of a sad aftermath of the wartime hysteria. Then I did
                    shipping services, which involved some rather interesting cases of seamen who'd
                    gotten into trouble. Then later, a little bit of visa work. And then, for a
                    while, the normal administrative chores of the consulate general.</p>
                <p>It was a handsome building, modeled on the White House, that was on the Yokohama
                    waterfront, and later, like a lot of our buildings in Japan, was sold off. For a
                    while it was made into a beer hall. I went back then and had a beer at exactly
                    the place my desk had been as a vice consul. Finally it was destroyed and a
                    Japanese hotel erected on the site.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you said these Japanese-Americans were former
                        citizens, and you were trying to help them return to the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: During the war, as you know, many Japanese-Americans were put in
                    concentration camps. And some of them, who were pro-Japanese during the war,
                    namely just out of resentment at how they'd been treated by their own
                    government, were shipped back to Japan. When the war was over, in the post-war
                    misery, with their roots in many cases being actually in the United States more
                    than in Japan, they applied to regain American citizenship. They formally
                    petitioned for this through the consular procedures, and we would forward their
                    petitions to Washington, with information on their cases, and they would be
                    acted on. It took many years before these all were finished off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many of these kinds of cases did you handle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: By my time, they'd grown to be a lesser trickle rather than a flood.
                    But even then, in '55-56, I think I handled at least one or two a week,
                    probably.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were then assigned to the Economic Section of the
                        American Embassy in Tokyo. How did your duties change when you moved to the
                        U.S. Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: I'd taken two years of Japanese language training at the Embassy
                    Language School, which was an excellent course, and then went in as a rather raw
                    officer into the Economic Section and worked on East-West trade issues. We were
                    trying to persuade the Japanese not to sell too much to the Soviets or to the
                    Chinese Communists. There were the COCOM regulations, which limited the types of
                    strategic articles that they could sell.</p>
                <p>Occasionally, we'd have a real issue. The one I remember was wide-diameter pipe
                    for the Soviets to build an oil pipeline from the Urals all the way into Western
                    Europe. We were trying to persuade Japan not to sell the pipe.</p>
                <p>I also reported on things as the Japanese companies did get involved with China
                    and the Soviet Union. They had a fair amount of trade, and we were just trying
                    to follow it and see what they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of influence, or maybe pressure, did you bring
                        to bear on the Japanese to discourage them from engaging in that kind of
                        trade? What kind of leverage did you have in that position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: My superiors, occasionally, when it was a significant issue, would go
                    in. The minister for economic affairs, when I was there, was an excellent man,
                    Philip Trezise, a fine economist, a very savvy man on Japan. And occasionally,
                    when there was an issue that Washington took seriously, he would go in to the
                    Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, occasionally with me in tow, and make an
                    issue out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude of the Japanese in those kinds of
                        meetings? How did they respond to these overtures?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: They would cooperate, but they would be skeptical, I think. They
                    thought we were too ideological, too fixated on these issues. But the ties with
                    the United States were so important to Japan that they weren't going to
                    jeopardize them over relatively minor amounts involving trade with the Communist
                    countries. So they were usually responsive when we wanted to make an issue out
                    of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it make a difference whether you were talking about
                        trade with the People's Republic of China as opposed to the Soviet
                        Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Well, at that time, not too much difference. The Japanese did, and
                    still, find the Soviets, the Russians, very difficult to deal with. China, they
                    thought, was a difficult market, but a market with more prospects in the long
                    run. When I started, it was a period when the Chinese were being very hard-nosed
                    to Japan.</p>
                <p>I came, I think, shortly after there was a rather strange incident called the
                    Nagasaki flag incident, when a young Japanese right-winger ripped down a paper
                    Chinese Communist flag at a postage-stamp exhibit at a department store in
                    Nagasaki. It got in the newspaper, and Beijing, the Chinese Communist
                    leadership, decided to make it an issue with Japan. They blew it up and then put
                    a total embargo on trade with Japan, to try to pressure them on some of the
                    political issues at that time.</p>
                <p>The Japanese were quite disconcerted, although it didn't achieve the results the
                    Chinese expected. The Japanese trading companies, like Mitsubishi or Shoji or
                    Mitsui Bussan, founded what were called dummy companies. For instance, there was
                    one, Meiwa Sangyo, which was a known dummy for, I believe, Mitsui Bussan. And
                    they just let them carry out the trade with Communist China. These companies
                    would act in a friendly fashion; that is, the president of the company would
                    echo the Chinese political line at the time, so that the Chinese would approve
                    of them politically. It was all subterfuge, a Kabuki phenomenon that the
                    Japanese companies found useful in continuing their trade with China.</p>
                <p>China wanted the Japanese imports and wanted to sell to Japan, so they themselves
                    kind of went along with this subterfuge. And then, finally, the whole thing
                    evaporated with the passage of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you arrived in Japan, the Japanese economy was
                        really starting to take off. Were you surprised by the speed with which
                        Japan recovered from the war? What was your thinking about that as an
                        economics officer there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Looking back on it, my own thoughts, I think, were thin. I think,
                    generally, Americans were surprised at the speed of the recovery. But it was not
                    an easy, very fast process. When I got to Japan as a Foreign Service officer in
                    '55, there were still large sections of Yokohama that were burnt-out fields,
                    just ashes. I remember going down by Yokohama Harbor and hearing an ungodly
                    noise coming out of kind of a warehouse building. It turned out to be a truck
                    fender factory. And the way that they were making truck fenders then was not
                    through a gigantic press, like they would now, but it was an individual workman,
                    with a hammer and a flat piece of metal, which he would pound on top of a wooden
                    form until it became the shape of a fender. It wasn't a rich country, by any
                    means, then.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>But my timing, in one sense, was very good, because '55 was just about the end of
                    the post-war miseries and the real beginning of Japanese prosperity, I think.
                    And as the years went along, you could see it: people were well clothed, they
                    began to eat well, the stores got fancier and fancier, you began to see more
                    private cars on the road, traffic increased steadily. All the elements of
                    prosperity, year by year, were becoming much more evident during the ten years
                    of my duty there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that something that you tried to explain to your
                        superiors in Washington? How do you explain it, I guess that's what I'm
                        asking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: My superiors, Ambassador MacArthur, Minister Trezise, would make a
                    real point of it with visitors, that Japan had a very vigorous industrial
                    economy. This had to be pointed out to the American visitors at that time,
                    because the image was still of a broken-down Japan, one that was just pulling
                    itself together from the destruction of war.</p>
                <p>I remember Ambassador MacArthur had a standard briefing that he gave to one group
                    of visitors after another. And like anybody who gives the same talk, the same
                    briefing, time after time, you begin to can it and you have the same
                    expressions. He had one which I think was something like “Japan is the Ruhr of
                    Asia.” His experience was in Germany and France, and the similes he would bring
                    up, that this was like the great belt of industry along the Rhine, that Japan
                    had the same sort of massive industrial capacity that north France, West
                    Germany, and the United States had.</p>
                <p>It was a lesson that American business had to be told at that time, because it
                    was not self-evident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was one event that came up in 1960 in Japan that I
                        wanted to ask you about, and that was the debate over the adoption of a new
                        security treaty with the United States. I don't know if you would have been
                        directly involved in that or not, but I was just wondering what you remember
                        about that. Do you remember? There was a lot of opposition to it. I think
                        President Eisenhower was going to visit the country and decided to cancel
                        his visit. Do you remember that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>SYLVESTER: My duties were not officially with the negotiation of the security
                    treaty, but I arrived in the embassy, in the chancery, at exactly the time that
                    the major demonstrations and riots began over the revision of the security
                    treaty. And it was an awesome sight, because I think there were up to a
                    half-million Japanese, on some days, who made a circuit that went by the
                    National Police Agency, the Diet, the prime minister's official residence, and
                    then came by the front of the American Embassy. There was this sea of Japanese
                    who were chanting “Amgo hantai!” (Against the security treaty!) “Amgo hantai!
                    Amgo hantai!” It was an almost hypnotic, roaring chant.</p>
                <p>And it was a popular thing; the Asahi and the other newspapers generally
                    supported the demonstrations. It was a mass phenomenon.</p>
                <p>My future wife was a member of a theater group, which, like most Japanese
                    cultural groups, had left-wing inclinations, and a lot of them would participate
                    in this, and then later in the evening would drop off at my house for a
                    drink.</p>
                <p>The whole atmosphere was one of enormous tension.</p>
                <p>I remember being in the lobby of the embassy when Mr. Hagerty, Eisenhower's press
                    secretary, arrived from the airport. He'd been in a car that had gotten caught
                    in a student demonstration then. The students had rocked the car and stomped on
                    it. He'd finally been rescued and brought to the embassy by American helicopter.
                    And they were very shaken, with good reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was the treaty so controversial?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: I think there were a variety of reasons. In one sense, the context of
                    it was the very beginning of the youth revolution that was to hit us in the
                    1960s. The radical youth leaders of Tokyo University and so forth were very
                    prominent in the disturbances.</p>
                <p>In part, it was the strength of the left generally in Japan at that time. The
                    left, particularly the Communists, had stood against the Japanese militarists,
                    and they emerged from the war with prestige, the right wing having been
                    disgraced by having led Japan into that disastrous war. The left saw Communism,
                    Socialism as the wave of the future. They saw the Americans as capitalists, as
                    imperialists. They saw the security treaty as tying Japan to American
                    militarism.</p>
                <p>The public was deeply pacifist after the tragedy of the war and was not really
                    sympathetic to being tied to a military agreement with the United States, even
                    though the leaders thought it essential in this dangerous post-war world.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>There were many reasons, but it all came together in part because the prime
                    minister at that time, Nobusuke Kishi, was a somewhat Nixon-like figure, a man
                    who had been a minister in prewar governments, in Prime Minister Tojo's cabinet,
                    and was once again the leader of Japan, and he was the one who was pushing the
                    security treaty through the National Diet. In the end, they had to force it over
                    against a rowdy filibuster by the opposition parties within the Diet. And that
                    action, plus Kishi's personality, became the final crux of the security treaty
                    riots.</p>
                <p>When it all finished, when Kishi was forced out of office, the whole thing
                    deflated like a balloon that's lost its air.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had read that. Did any of the hostility toward the
                        treaty, or toward American policy generally, manifest itself in any
                        hostility on the part of the Japanese toward American Foreign Service people
                        working in Japan? And were you the target of hostility as a representative
                        of the American government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: No, there was very little real anti-Americanism in the whole
                    phenomenon. It was a protest about American policy, about Japanese government
                    policy, about the personality of Kishi, but the Japanese as a whole tended to be
                    rather friendly to Americans. And I found this true even of many among the
                    political left. I later got to know a number of Socialist Diet members and
                    opposition politicians, and they'd be as friendly as everybody to Americans. The
                    Communists were usually professionally hostile to us and would stay away from us
                    and so forth, but there was very little overt anti-Americanism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to ask you at least one more question about Japan.
                        Edwin Reischauer would have been ambassador at the time you left, or at
                        least you would have served through his tenure as ambassador. Could you tell
                        me a little bit about him, what kind of ambassador he was, how well you knew
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: I thought he was a very fine man and an excellent ambassador. He was a
                    man of good sense, of friendliness, of enormous understanding of Japan. His
                    manner of working with the Japanese was what was necessary in the
                    post-security-treaty period. He was an excellent choice, and I think he was an
                    example of how a non-career ambassador, if well chosen, can be among certainly
                    the best choices.</p>
                <p>I think the only fault was, he was not experienced in the ways of Washington,
                    like Ambassador Douglas MacArthur II was, and I think he had more trouble
                    getting Washington to do things than a more experienced bureaucrat might have
                    had.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>But he was very proper for the times. I was a junior officer; I knew him and I
                    called on him several times after he retired and went back to Harvard, and then
                    after he ultimately retired from there. I thought the world of him.</p>
                <p>I think his hardest problem, when I was there, was the negotiations for the
                    reversion of Okinawa. Okinawa had been essentially run as an American military
                    colony after our bloody victory there during the war, and the American military
                    authorities were very reluctant to see it returned to Japan, or even to share in
                    its governance with Japanese authorities. But the essential problem was that
                    Okinawa was still desperately poor at a time when the main islands of Japan were
                    increasingly prosperous. The Japanese government regarded Okinawa as part of
                    Japan. They wanted its return, they wanted to bring the living standard of the
                    people of Okinawa up to mainland standards, and they wanted to offer money to
                    help this process. And we were in this ridiculous posture of refusing Japanese
                    financial help to the island, because the military authorities felt that that
                    was baloney tactics, that the Japanese would use that as the entr�e and then
                    steadily erode the ability of our senior military authorities to govern Okinawa
                    as we thought was necessary. Ambassador Reischauer had to argue that in the long
                    run this was absolutely necessary for American interests, that Okinawa was very
                    important to our military, but that good relations with Japan and a healthy
                    relationship with the security treaty was far more important to the United
                    States than an ability to run Okinawa just as we wanted. But General Caraway,
                    who was the general in charge in Okinawa when Reischauer first went, was a
                    hard-line person, and he deeply resented Reischauer's policy recommendations.
                    And there were some sour relations between the Army headquarters in Okinawa and
                    the embassy. But after General Caraway left, his successors were quite
                    broad-gauged generals, and the mood in the Pentagon in Washington also changed.
                    And by the time Ambassador Reischauer finished his embassy appointment, very
                    substantial progress had been made on the Okinawa issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask you about that. While it was eventually
                        returned to Japan, it was after Reischauer had left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Yes, it was 1972 when it finally took place. But the whole process had
                    been put well under way by Reischauer. Another officer who was very instrumental
                    in the process was Richard Sneider, who later became ambassador to Korea. And
                    his officer, Howard McElroy, who later worked for me, was a very able junior
                    officer on that issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to ask you some questions about Vietnam, but before
                        we get to Vietnam, I know you spent at least one year in the White House, on
                        the White House staff, in 1967, I think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me a little bit about that, what your
                        duties were and how you came to join the White House staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Well, I was taken over essentially as a flunky. The White House, under
                    President Johnson, tried to make a point of being a very lean operation, a
                    parsimonious operation. So they covered all their expenses by borrowing
                    everything from other government departments; they'd levy a photocopier from the
                    Pentagon or a junior officer from State. And I was brought over to help in the
                    office of the special assistant for the Vietnam civil policy, the pacification
                    program. It was run by a very capable, rather acerbic ex-CIA officer named
                    Robert Komer, and he had as a deputy Ambassador William Leonhart, a very bright
                    senior Foreign Service officer. And I just worked for Leonhart, basically
                    shuffling his papers.</p>
                <p>But it was interesting to watch, because what Komer and Leonhart were trying to
                    do was make a sensible, concerted effort on the civil side in Vietnam. In
                    Vietnam, until that period, we had both military and civilian advisors in the
                    countryside. And all the agencies were represented, not only Army, Navy, Air
                    Force, Coast Guard, Marines, and so forth, but the U.S. Information Agency, or
                    agricultural advisors under AID. It was clearly necessary to get everybody to
                    work together, which they weren't doing very well up to that period. Komer was
                    brought in to spearhead this, and he, working with the embassy in Saigon and the
                    MACV authorities, finally combined the whole effort in the countryside of
                    Vietnam as a joint effort.</p>
                <p>For instance, the advisors, working with a Vietnamese province chief, who up to
                    then would go in individually to present their problems or what they wanted to
                    push on..., all worked, after that, for one person, the province senior advisor.
                    The military advisors and the civilian advisors were wedded together. In one
                    province, you'd have an Army lieutenant colonel be the senior advisor, and he'd
                    have a civilian deputy, an AID guy or a Foreign Service officer on loan. In the
                    next province, it would be the other way around; the civilian might be the
                    senior guy.</p>
                <p>Komer was pushing this all from the Washington end, trying to get it all to gel.
                    And there were many, many problems, like getting supplies through the congested
                    port of Saigon, trying to get the Vietnamese corps commanders to focus on the
                    civilian side as well as their straight military duties.</p>
                <p>And it was well done. Komer pushed very hard. He was an abrasive but effective
                    man. He later went out to work as a deputy for the commander of MACV in Saigon,
                    quite successfully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was MACV?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: The Military Assistance Command, Vietnam. And that took in, in the
                    end, all American military activities, plus the pacification program, in
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you think the White House was putting enough emphasis
                        on pacification while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Yes, well that came straight down from the president.</p>
                <p>The only time I ever personally met a president was when Komer took us over one
                    day, his, I think, seven or eight officers, to meet President Johnson in the
                    Fish Room, his conference room in the White House. Johnson lived up to every
                    story I'd ever heard about him: he was press-the-flesh; he was dominating; he
                    was funny; he was acerbic. But he was also very interested in the particulars of
                    the civil programs. For instance, What was the price of pork in Saigon?, an
                    indicator of how the civilian economy was going. And he questioned Komer, I
                    thought, intelligently and well about the issues.</p>
                <p>There was one funny thing. Johnson hated to have his staff take vacations, but
                    somehow Komer had persuaded Johnson to let him take a week of leave, going over
                    to France with his family. And Johnson, in this meeting that we were in, kidded,
                    or actually rode, Komer pretty heavily about goofing off for a week. Finally, he
                    turned to the rest of us and said, “Now I hope you all will go home tonight,
                    take a good long vacation, and then come back refreshed tomorrow morning.”</p>
                <p>But it was very interesting, and Komer was clearly following what the president
                    wanted as he did this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your experience in Japan influence your thinking about
                        the Vietnam War? My impression is that the Japanese generally weren't very
                        supportive of American involvement. What did you think about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: It probably influenced me some, but I think I was probably more
                    influenced by my honors thesis in college on the Spanish Civil War, because
                    there were many parallels between the war in Vietnam and the war in Spain,
                    1936-39. They were both cockpits for the great power conflicts of their era, yet
                    they were also brutal civil wars. I felt strongly about the values of the war in
                    Spain, generally favoring the republican side. And I thought one of the great
                    lapses that led to World War II was the failure of the democracies to assist the
                    side in Spain that to the largest extent shared their values. And I felt, in
                    Vietnam, that we had a duty to try to help people who shared our values, to the
                    extent that you have them in a developing country like that. And I felt the
                    Republic of Vietnam, despite its many faults, was a semi-democracy and that we
                    had a duty to help them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you went to the Mekong Delta in 1968, is that
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me about that? Why did you go, or how did
                        you get that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Well, I volunteered for it. I was working on the Thai Desk after I
                    finished my short duty in the White House. A friend of mine came back; he'd been
                    an advisor up in Hue. And listening to him, I realized it was something I wanted
                    to do. So I volunteered for it, and I took a year of Vietnamese language
                    training. I went there in August of '68, after Tet. I asked to go to the Mekong
                    Delta because my brother had worked there and I was just interested in it, and
                    was assigned in the Province of Chau-doc, which was a rather colorful province
                    on the Cambodian border where the Mekong and the Bassac rivers enter Cambodia.
                    It had an area that had been a traditional refuge for outlaws and people of new
                    religions, called the Seven Mountains. The Hoa Hao people, one of the odd
                    religious sects, were well represented there. I worked as a new-life development
                    officer, which in essence was just economic development, and did many tasks. I
                    was there for six months and then got promoted to become a deputy province
                    senior advisor, working for a very fine Vietnamese-speaking Army colonel, Billy
                    Stanberry, who was a very savvy, decent guy. This was in the Province of
                    Kien-giang, right next to Chau-doc, in the town of Rach-gia. It was also a very
                    interesting province, which went from the Communist stronghold of the U-minh
                    Forest up to the Cambodian border, where there was a curious little town called
                    Ha-tien. And I worked there for six months on the tasks of an advisory team,
                    which included the civilian side and the straight military side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said your brother had worked in the Mekong Delta. What
                        had he done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: He was a Foreign Service officer also. He was a China specialist, a
                    graduate of the Naval Academy. He'd been an all-weather interceptor pilot for
                    six years, until he joined our business. After Chinese language training, he got
                    assigned to Binh Xuyen in the Delta. I visited him there in '67, for my first
                    look at Vietnam, and I'd heard all of his stories about it.</p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that in Chau-doc, you worked in economic
                        development. What kind of economic development activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Well, we were trying to bring a better life to the people. The
                    activities could range from refugee relief, getting food to people who were
                    displaced by the combat activity, to things that were really true development.
                    We had an advisor there who was trying to get chicken-raising made more
                    efficient. How do you raise large numbers of chickens at the lowest cost? He was
                    very good and got some people going with, by our standards, small scale, but by
                    Vietnamese standards, large-scale raising of chickens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Chau-doc had been the site of some fighting during
                        the Tet Offensive, as I recall. What was the military situation like there
                        when you arrived in the province?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: By the time I got there, it had been stabilized. Chau-doc City had
                    been half occupied in the course of the battle. And there was an Army enlisted
                    man there who won the Congressional Medal of Honor as they retook the town. By
                    my time, there was still a Communist presence down in the southern mountains,
                    and that could be a little hairy at times. The first times I heard gunfire were
                    in that area, while I was stationed in Vietnam. But it was generally quiet. The
                    Communists had been badly racked-up in the battle, just as they were across
                    Vietnam. They'd taken terrible losses at Tet. Despite the political capital they
                    gained out of that battle, militarily it was a disaster for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective do you think the pacification program was
                        generally in that area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: I thought it was very effective. It reflected Communist military
                    weakness. The traditional Viet Cong units, the southern Communist units, had
                    been so badly bloodied during the Tet Offensive, they just couldn't hold on to
                    the land that they'd had before, and they were in general retreat across all of
                    the Delta. And so the government was moving out and extending protection and
                    prosperity to more and more of the countryside of the Mekong Delta. I don't
                    think it was because of our civilian programs, but they certainly helped the
                    process of making the people of the countryside glad to have the Communists gone
                    and the government back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1969, you became senior advisor in Binh-long. That was
                        along the Cambodian border to the north of where you had been. Was the
                        situation there different than it had been in the Mekong Delta? Could you
                        kind of compare and contrast the two regions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>SYLVESTER: The Mekong was archetypical South Vietnam. It was broad fields,
                    semi-modern farming, fairly well populated, but more like Indiana than kind of
                    the overcrowded Red River Delta around Hanoi. Binh-long, which was north of
                    Saigon, again on the Cambodian border, was an area which had been forest until
                    relatively recently, when the French, in the prewar years, hacked out a number
                    of major rubber plantations. Terre Rouge (the Red Soil) was the name of one of
                    them. It was a relatively thinly populated province, many Montagnards, mainly
                    Stieng, a proto-Cambodian type people. The Vietnamese were in large part North
                    Vietnamese who'd been brought in, sometimes under not very good circumstances,
                    in the prewar years, to be the workers on the rubber plantations.</p>
                <p>Our province town was called An-loc, and the province as a whole was relatively
                    heavily fought over, both before, during, and after I was there. The so-called
                    Fishhook area was just to our west, and M�m�t and Snuol, two French rubber
                    plantation towns in Cambodia, were just on the northwest and north sides of the
                    province. It was very easy for the Communist main force units, the 5th, 7th, and
                    9th Divisions, formerly Viet Cong, but by my time almost exclusively North
                    Vietnamese main force units. And they would periodically come into the province
                    to seek battles, hopefully to bloody the Americans, or the South Vietnamese Army
                    units, and then retreat quickly over the border.When I was there, I think the
                    worst action was when they hit an ARVN armored battalion, surprised it at night
                    and inflicted fairly heavy losses on it, and then very quickly retreated out of
                    the province again.</p>
                <p>Then, after I left, during the 1972 offensive, they struck very heavily, occupied
                    the northern district town of Loc-ninh, and then besieged An-loc, and the town
                    took terrible losses. The ARVN, the regiment of the 5th Division that was there,
                    the Ranger Battalion, and the local troops, who were under my province chief, a
                    fine officer named Tram Van Nhut, withstood the Communist siege for months,
                    greatly helped by our B-52s and our air support, which allowed them to
                    survive.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Yes, this was the so-called Easter Offensive. It was a prelude to what
                    took place at the very end of the war. But the Communists took such heavy losses
                    at it, both around An-loc and then up by the demilitarized zone just north of
                    Hue, that that, plus the so-called Christmas bombing by President Nixon,
                    persuaded them that they had to change their strategy, and they signed that
                    spurious peace agreement.</p>

                        there during that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Yes, I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little bit about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Well, I followed it very closely. In fact, I went over the border
                    myself a number of times, against orders, and I finally got officially rebuked
                    for doing it, which I deserved. But I was very curious to know what was
                    happening across the border, partly because it affected by own duties as
                    province senior advisor.</p>
                <p>We struck across the border very heavily with our forces, and it, I thought, was
                    effective in part. We picked up enormous amounts of equipment that Communists
                    had stockpiled there. The Communist main force units had this protected zone
                    across the border. The local people, the Cambodians, the French planters in
                    Cambodia, knew that they were not supposed to go into these zones. And they were
                    a true sanctuary for the North. We did some bombing in there, the so-called
                    secret bombing, but that was limited. It had some effect, but wasn't extensive
                    enough really to trouble the Communists that much. When we struck across the
                    border, it was very disconcerting to the North Vietnamese units, and they had to
                    move rather quickly back further into Cambodia. It was only a partial success,
                    as far as I could see. The North Vietnamese units decided to avoid combat, and
                    except for some very minor scrapping, they just retreated out of range. The fact
                    that we had limited the incursion and publicly stated it by President Nixon,
                    meant that they just had to go further to enter new sanctuaries. But it
                    certainly put their whole timetable back; they lost immense amounts of
                    supplies.</p>
                <p>The authors who are critical of the incursion say that, by doing it, we caused
                    the war in Cambodia, or at least we broadened the war in Cambodia. I personally
                    think that's a misreading of what happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>The whole thing in Cambodia happened for Cambodian reasons: the Cambodian elite
                    had gotten tired of Sihanouk's petty tyrannies and were distressed at how the
                    Communist Vietnamese were essentially governing, on their own, the border areas
                    of Cambodia proper. Finally, this resentment bubbled up and they mounted this
                    coup against Sihanouk, which went faster and further than I think even the
                    perpetrators in Phnom Penh had expected. Sihanouk did not come back to Cambodia,
                    and the whole thing escalated such that they finally declared a republic of
                    Cambodia, the Khmer Republic. As part of it, they told the Communist Vietnamese
                    forces on the border that they had to leave Cambodia. The Vietnamese Communists
                    were surprised and appalled at this and decided that they had no recourse but to
                    reject this. In fact, when the Khmer army started to attack the Vietnamese
                    Communist-held areas on the Cambodian border, the PAVN, the North Vietnamese
                    forces, decided to generally counter and just sweep them all out, so that they
                    could continue to control the sanctuaries on the border like they had before.
                    And as part of it, they assisted the native Cambodian movement, which became the
                    so-called Khmer Rouge. I think, for the Communist Vietnamese, Cambodia was
                    always a sideshow; all that they were really trying for was to control the
                    staging areas that they'd used in the war up to that point so well within
                    Cambodia. But they fought against the forces of the Khmer Republic, put it very
                    much on the defensive in the Chenla II campaign, and turned the task over to the
                    Khmer Rouge. And then, very late in the game, were appalled to find that they'd
                    lost control of the Khmer Rouge, and the Khmer Rouge had turned even against
                    them, against any Vietnamese, including their Communist older brothers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You referred a minute ago to the secret bombing of
                        Cambodia preceding the American invasion. How secret was that? Did you know
                        about that before the invasion? Did you know about that at the time it was
                        going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: When I first became province senior advisor, the U.S. Air Force FAC
                    (Forward Air Controller) who was assigned to my team took me up in his light
                    observation plane for a trip around the borders of the province, so I could get
                    a feel for what the province was like. As we went along the west edge of
                    Binh-long, you could see that the bomb craters from the B-52s of TAC Air
                    continued right into Cambodia. I asked him about it, and he said, “Well, you
                    know, the Communists don't respect the border there, so we bomb a certain extent
                    into Cambodia to get them.” I recorded this. It seemed logical. I didn't realize
                    it was supposed to be any secret. In fact, if some reporter had asked me later
                    about it, I'm sure I would have told him. And only later did I discover that
                    this was supposed to be a grand secret. I think quite a few people knew about
                    it, certainly Sihanouk knew about it, the Communists knew about it. But the
                    press never fixed on it as an issue until it came out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you said, after the invasion you were officially
                        reprimanded for going into Cambodia, why was that? Why were you not supposed
                        to go into Cambodia, if there were American troops there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Ambassador Colby, who headed the pacification program, felt that if
                    you had American civilian advisors going in too, across the border, it had the
                    implication that our government was getting involved in more than the straight
                    military sense. He, and I think the Washington authorities, wanted to avoid that
                    image. John Van and other senior advisors, before that directive came out, and
                    I, had gone across at the beginning. And for good reasons, they put this order
                    out. I should have obeyed it; I don't have any excuse, but what happened up in
                    Snuol and M�m�t so affected my province, I just felt that I needed to know what
                    was happening there. And partly because I did disobey orders, I think I was able
                    to do a couple of things that were important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you elaborate on that, just briefly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Well, one of them was rather a strange one. Well, two.</p>
                <p>I arranged for Vietnamese who were in Cambodia across from Vietnam to be
                    evacuated. I went over and talked to a number of them and said we would bring
                    them out. And we did. And it probably saved their lives, because later on, of
                    course, the Khmer Rouge killed-off any Vietnamese still resident in
                    Cambodia.</p>
                <p>And second, when our forces were pulling out of Snuol, for some reason they were
                    going to leave there the trucks of the rubber plantation. I think they had
                    orders that they weren't supposed to loot anything, take anything out. But I
                    thought it was foolish to leave all these fine trucks there—there were a lot of
                    them—which would have been immediately picked up by the Communist forces and
                    used for their supply. So I pressed on the issue, and finally the Army agreed,
                    and they sent back a unit that picked up all these trucks and drove them out.
                    They were actually later driven all the way down through Saigon to Phnom
                    Penh.</p>

                    Section. It was a big embassy, and the hierarchy down to me was Ambassador
                    Bunker, a very fine man; Deputy Ambassador Berger, a very able man; and then my
                    two bosses, the political minister and the political counselor. I was a fifth
                    level down, and I had seven officers, all but one of whom spoke excellent
                    Vietnamese, who followed Vietnamese internal political affairs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you assess the prospects for the survival of the
                        Saigon government when you were there in '71-72? I guess Thieu was president
                        at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Yes, President Thieu was there.</p>
                <p>Well, it was hard to read the future, like always, but I think our feeling was
                    that it was going to be difficult for the South to survive. They were equal in
                    size with the North, but the North was better disciplined; it was a totalitarian
                    state; it had a well-led, highly experienced army. It had unity, partly because
                    of what was possible under a Stalinist system. It was well led; the Communist
                    leaders were effective.</p>
                <p>The South was more sloppy; it was a more diverse society, with minorities of race
                    and religion. The South was generally a more relaxed, laid-back area. You
                    couldn't have the discipline of a Communist system. It was a semi-democracy, and
                    so there was always political dispute.</p>
                <p>Thieu was in many ways a very capable man, but he had his weak points. He was
                    tolerant of some of his lieutenants, like General Quang, who were notoriously
                    corrupt.</p>
                <p>It was clearly going to be difficult for the South. And in the end, it always
                    depended on a relatively consistent, relatively large amount of assistance from
                    the United States, both material and psychological, and on American manpower.
                    And if the United States was not consistent in this, I think we were always
                    somewhat skeptical of the South's chances. Even in retrospect, I feel, if
                    American support had been consistent, even at a lower level, the Republic of
                    Vietnam might still be there. But we weren't.</p>

                <p>SYLVESTER: Yes, it was winding down.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the morale like in the U.S. Embassy? You said you
                        knew that it would be difficult for the South to survive, it would need
                        American support, and yet American support was dwindling. How did that
                        affect the morale?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>SYLVESTER: I don't think we had serious morale problems. Bunker and Berger were
                    highly respected by all of us. There was a certain division by age in the
                    embassy. The younger officers, stretching up probably to me, were somewhat more
                    skeptical of Thieu, jaundiced about the chances. The senior leadership, I think,
                    felt that the alternatives were such that we had to work closely with the Thieu
                    government and do our best. There was an age difference in viewpoint, both among
                    the Foreign Service officers and our colleagues in the CIA, but it was not a
                    morale issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you anticipate that the American aid that you thought
                        would be necessary would continue, or were you deeply worried about that at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: We worried about it. We thought it depended on strong political
                    purpose at the top, in the Executive part of government. Clearly our public had
                    turned against involvement in Vietnam. We were going to have to get out
                    militarily. And when you pulled all those American divisions out of Vietnam, it
                    cut the military force that defended Vietnam in half. So it was going to be far
                    harder in the future. And I think we all knew that it became a much more iffy, a
                    much more dangerous situation for the South. My own feelings were that we could
                    still do it, if we did it well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think of the peace treaty in '73?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: I think I was skeptical. I was hopeful, but I was very skeptical. I
                    felt the only way the peace agreement in '73 would survive, would be respected,
                    would be if the Americans would police it. And that meant having a credible
                    threat if the Communists violated it wholesale. And that depended on having a
                    president who was politically viable. My own feeling is, Mr. Nixon and Mr.
                    Kissinger gave away too much in that agreement. But I give them the benefit of
                    the doubt; I think they planned to try to enforce the agreement with American
                    arms, a return of American air power, if the Communists violated the agreement
                    wholesale. But when the Communists began their main-line offensive, first with
                    the attack on Phuoc-long, in, I guess, '74, and there was no American response,
                    Hanoi knew quite clearly that the Americans would not police the agreement that
                    we'd signed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: I don't think I was surprised. As I remember, I felt, after the rout
                    in Pleiku, that the end had come. In fact, a couple of friends of mine,
                    knowledgeable guys, thought the South could still hang on, and I disagreed with
                    them. I think, at that time, my judgment was fairly good.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What led you to that conclusion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Well, it was partly a trip I made back, in 1973, to Vietnam, when a
                    friend of mine took me up on a long drive through III Corps, the back country of
                    III Corps, an area that I'd known fairly well. And it was lonely; there just
                    wasn't much military on our side there, since the American divisions had left.
                    It was very clear that the South had so much less to defend with, and the ARVN
                    divisions, at the very best, were going to be sorely stretched. I thought the
                    ARVN was better than Americans gave them credit for, but it was an extremely
                    difficult job to defend against a North Vietnamese offensive with the little
                    that was left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a lack of manpower, desertion, a failure to
                        mobilize the resources, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: I think basically it was a lack of manpower. The South was on the
                    defensive. We never encouraged it, trained it, to take the offense against North
                    Vietnam. So it was a defensive force, and when you're on the defense, you need
                    more. A lot of the troops were on static defense. The North had the initiative.
                    And it was a big country; the highlands were a long way from the delta. You
                    couldn't move troops up there easily to group your defenses when there was a
                    North Vietnamese offensive. The South didn't have the mobility.</p>
                <p>But it was beyond that, of course. The South Vietnamese generals, again, I
                    thought, were better than Americans gave them credit for, but clearly they were
                    spotty. You had very good ones, like General Truong up in I Corps, and you had
                    very weak ones, who hadn't had much combat experience, who were essentially
                    political generals.</p>
                <p>So there was an assortment of weaknesses that all came into play.</p>
                <p>I think, actually, the Communists were surprised at how easily their victory
                    came, because they'd been fighting, before the collapse in April '75, hard,
                    continuous battles up in I Corps, and the ARVN had given a very good account of
                    themselves in those battles. They'd fought equally against the Northern
                    units.</p>
                <p>It's partly just the panic that comes with a bad defeat. American troops have
                    experienced it in our history, too, at Bull Run, at Kasserine Pass, and so
                    forth. We're not immune to that, when you begin to collapse and it all comes to
                    pieces.</p>
                <p>The final defeat was one in which the Southern units thought, not without reason,
                    that their cause was hopeless. The Americans were no longer there to help them,
                    and there just wasn't enough to hold the defense.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you about one more assignment, and that was the
                        couple of years you spent in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. What
                        was that, and what did you do there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: INR (as it's abbreviated) is an interesting organization. It's
                    analytic; it's not an intelligence-collecting agency. It takes all the
                    information, all the intelligence that can be found, which ranges from newspaper
                    stories and CNN through the most highly classified CIA and NSA intelligence
                    reports, and then analysts look at it, try to make sense out of it, and write
                    reports for policymakers. So that the intelligence is boiled down to what a
                    policymaker needs to know, what he needs to have in his mind when he makes
                    decisions about what America should do in the world. The Central Intelligence
                    Agency does the same thing: part of CIA is analytic; part of it operational. In
                    a sense, is a competitor with CIA analysis, a check on CIA analysis. It was an
                    alternative for the policymaker. And that's very healthy. A senior American
                    official should have alternative views. It's a healthy phenomenon to have
                    intelligence analysis come from at least a couple of sources to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For whom were these reports prepared?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: For the president, the secretary of state, all the officials of the
                    Department of State, and it was given to anybody else senior in government, in
                    the Pentagon or agency, who was interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been during the Carter
                        administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Yes, I was there largely during the Carter period.</p>
                <p>I think it was highly regarded. My last job was mainly as an editor; as my most
                    senior position in the Foreign Service, I was in kind of a windowless cubicle,
                    just editing. But it was a useful thing. We did, every day, something called the
                    Morning Summary, which went to the president and down. It included spot
                    intelligence—a report that X was happening in Guatemala or whatever. The front
                    part of the Morning Summary was very short things like this that the official
                    would read the first thing in the morning. The latter part of the Morning
                    Summary was four short essays. As editor, I insisted that they be no more than
                    one page, and that the premier thoughts be at the very beginning, so the
                    policymaker, within the first two sentences, could get the whole import of what
                    the analysis was. And we tried to make very well-written, very pertinent pieces,
                    the most critical things that policymakers needed to know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you following things during the Carter administration

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Yes, exactly. Exactly. Yes, those were hot items.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think those are about all the questions I've got.
                        Anything I've left out you'd like to add?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Well, I guess I'd like to just talk a bit more about Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: In retrospect, I think one general conclusion that I've had was that
                    Vietnam as a whole was such a diverse country, with all its minorities, all its
                    different religious groups, the changes of geographical setting, and was a
                    country, in recent years, where so much had happened, that an outside observer
                    could look at the war in Vietnam and there was evidence for almost any sort of
                    case that you wanted to make about it, that you could argue it in any way and
                    find substantial facts or such to prove your case. So you could get very
                    legitimate arguments about the thing from those who were staunch defenders of
                    what the American government did there, to those who were most harshly critical
                    of it. It was really, to my mind, a very gray situation, and the grays could
                    range from the lightest of gray to the darkest of gray, and you could pick what
                    you wanted to focus on.</p>
                <p>My own feelings were, at the time and looking back on it, that our cause was
                    worthy there, that what we tried to do was in the interests of the people of
                    Vietnam, that if we had been successful in what we did, the people of the south
                    of Vietnam, perhaps all of Vietnam, would have been far better off. There never
                    would have been the million and a half refugees that fled Vietnam after '75, the
                    post-war poverty, and the purges through the so-called reeducation camps.</p>
                <p>I thought we did a lot of things well there. A lot of the pacification program
                    was intelligent and capably done.</p>
                <p>We did some things not so well. They varied, to my mind, from individual
                    programs, like the Ranch Hand program, where we dumped defoliant over the
                    forests so that we could more easily spot Communist unit movements under the
                    trees, which I thought was environmentally destructive and not very successful,
                    because the undergrowth, the bamboo, rapidly grew up after you'd defoliated, to
                    more major things, like we tended to over-Americanize the war, so that we built
                    up a very heavy sense of dependence, among the Vietnamese, on America. They
                    looked to America somehow to save them.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>There was a phenomenon I found rather odd. In 1988, when I revisited Vietnam and
                    talked to Communist officials, occasionally there were nuances in what they said
                    that made me think that even they thought that now America somehow could save
                    Vietnam from its economic problems and poverty.</p>
                <p>Also, in the course of Americanizing the war, I thought we shoved the Vietnamese
                    aside, often. In III Corps, when I was there, it was hard for the ARVN to get in
                    a fight, because the American commanders were so anxious to get their units into
                    battle. It was understandable, the American units were excellent, and the
                    commanders wanted to do their best, so if there was any fight there, they were
                    going to be in it. And so the ARVN, in those years, didn't get the experience,
                    the training, to get ready for the time when we pulled out and left them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it's fair to criticize President Johnson for
                        not doing more to educate American public opinion and to try to build
                        political support in this country early on for the war? I get the
                        impression, reading about Vietnam, sometimes, that by the time some of these
                        programs, like pacification, began to bear some fruit, public opinion in
                        this country had really turned against the war. There seemed to be a kind of
                        disconnect, in a way, between what was happening in Vietnam and what was
                        happening in the United States. I'd be kind of interested in your thoughts
                        about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: Well, clearly, as you look back, at the time of the Tonkin Gulf, we
                    needed a more thorough debate on whether to go into that war or not. A friend of
                    mine wrote a book on the Tonkin Gulf, and it was a murky incident. There wasn't
                    enough to be the underpinnings of a decision of that magnitude to involve our
                    country and a half-million young Americans in that distant war. We needed a more
                    thorough national consensus before we went into it.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, I don't think that any protracted war like that is ever going
                    to retain American public support. We held the course during World War II partly
                    because we painted the Nazis and the Japanese in the starkest and most racist
                    terms of evil, not without reason. In the Vietnam War, you couldn't describe it
                    in such absolute terms. With Vietnamese on our side, you couldn't make it a
                    racist war like we did in '41-45 in the Pacific. In any war like that, which is
                    gray and ambiguous, it's just hard to retain public support for year after year,
                    with the body bags coming back. I think, in retrospect, it was an impossible
                    task, the way we did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SYLVESTER: A couple of other comments. One is, why we went into the war. And it
                    seems to me fairly clear. There were two great historical lessons, to my mind,
                    which caused us to march into Vietnam the way we did.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>One was the Munich syndrome, the whole lesson of our experiences of getting into
                    World War II, which certainly shaped the viewpoint of people like Dean Rusk and
                    Kennedy and Johnson, the feeling that you had to stop an aggressor early in the
                    game, or later it was going to be far more costly, and that we'd done very
                    little to stop the aggressors before '41. We survived the war well because the
                    enemy did not have weapons that could reach our American homeland. But now, in
                    the 1960s, the Communists, both Russian and Chinese, had nukes. And they sounded
                    harsh and ambitious. Our leaders just were not going to repeat the errors of
                    World War II. We were going to engage early with them and stop them, so they
                    realized that there was no future in piecemeal aggression.</p>
                <p>And the second great lesson, I think, which weighed very heavily, certainly with
                    Johnson, was the abuse that the Democratic Party took for “losing China.” I
                    think Kennedy would have been the same way. They were not going to lose another
                    divided, partially Christian country to the Communists, on their beat of
                    political responsibility. Johnson had seen the Democrats pilloried for years for
                    having “lost China.” And here was Vietnam, a far smaller country, and he was not
                    going to repeat that disaster.</p>
                <p>I think those were the main factors—the lesson of World War II and the lesson of
                    the “loss of China”—that impelled Kennedy and Johnson and their lieutenants to
                    march us into Vietnam.</p>
                <p>And, to be honest, I partially agree with that, even in retrospect.</p>
                <p>One other thing I'd like to comment on, I guess, is democracy in South Vietnam,
                    and President Thieu. Our support of South Vietnam was widely criticized for
                    support of a dictator, President Thieu. South Vietnam was not a Vermont
                    democracy, and it was hard to rally Americans to support it.</p>
                <p>On the issue of democracy, it struck me, in one sense, that it was a bad rap,
                    because there was a lot of political discourse in Saigon when I was there. There
                    was an active political opposition. There was an opposition press; the political
                    cartoons were often vicious about Thieu and the government.</p>
                <p>The election for the national assembly when I was there was a reasonably good,
                    honest election. For the presidency, it was kind of a fiasco, because Thieu and
                    his lieutenants essentially pushed Ky out and planned to run against Minh. Big
                    Minh had a coalition of all sorts of opposition elements, and they could never
                    come together. He was skeptical both of his chances and of the possibilities for
                    a fair election. So he just bowed out of the election, leaving the whole thing a
                    fiasco, which was very harmful to congressional and American public support for
                    our effort there.</p>
                <p>But it was really fairly lively politics, considering it was a Third World
                    country that was in the midst of a very difficult civil war.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>On Thieu himself, he had serious faults, I think. He was not a charismatic
                    figure. He did not do a good job of leading the public, explaining to the
                    public, part of the chore of a great leader. But he listened to people. And one
                    of the strange phenomena was that I think he paid heed to all the political
                    elements of the South.</p>
                <p>He was an interesting contrast with Ngo Dinh Diem. Diem was a highly patriotic,
                    highly moral man, who tried to build a new Vietnam based on what he thought were
                    the best elements of South Vietnam society, which he tended to believe were
                    those of the northern Catholics of his own background. He tended to discriminate
                    against the Buddhist elements of South Vietnamese society. He was suspicious of
                    them, and in the end, that caused the Buddhist riots, the An-queng Buddhist
                    monks who led disturbances, and the generals who were increasingly restive under
                    him.</p>
                <p>As for Thieu, I found that if you listened to people all around, they all griped
                    about Thieu, they all complained about him, but none of them felt that he was a
                    vital threat to their group interests. And so, in a sense, he was a consensus
                    leader.</p>
                <p>And he had some real ability, both on the political side and the military side.
                    His decisions at the very end of the war proved to be disastrous, pulling the
                    Airborne out of I Corps and allowing General Phu to lead the retreat out of the
                    highlands. They just opened the floodwaters to finally sweep away the Republic.
                    But up to then, I think, both politically and militarily, Thieu had been a
                    reasonably good leader for the country. I didn't see anybody else around who
                    would have been better. I think we should have pressed him on his appointments
                    of the division commanders, so that the caliber of the military leaders was
                    raised higher than it was. But, looking back on it, he probably did a fairly
                    good job, considering the difficulties of it all.</p>
                <p>Shall we end on that?</p>
