                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: September 9, 1997</p>
                <p>Copyright 2000 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: Today is September 9, 1997, and this is an interview with William McAfee,
                    which is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and I am
                    Charles Stuart Kennedy. Can we start when and where you were born and a little
                    about your family?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: A friend of mine once said I looked like a person who had descended from
                    a long line of Calvinist maiden aunts, easy to understand since I was born
                    January 25, 1910, which makes me 87, at Port Royal, Pennsylvania, 45 miles west
                    of Harrisburg, where my dad was a Presbyterian minister. My mother was born in
                    Saint George, New Brunswick. Her father, a sea captain sailing out of Saint
                    John, moved his family to Portland [Maine] when he was 70, probably selecting
                    Portland because it was most like Saint John, which was near Saint George.
                    Though she always spoke fondly of Saint George, it must have been an exciting
                    change for a young girl of fifteen. I remember her in her late eighties saying,
                    “To be young looking up Exchange Street.” I grew up in Pennsylvania. Dad was a
                    minister there, then later at Taylor Street Presbyterian Church in Fort Worth
                    and at Patton, Pennsylvania. Dad was a student and scholar all his life and I
                    grew up thinking that was the only way; somewhere along the line I fell by the
                    wayside.</p>
                <p>I went to college at Wooster, in Wooster, Ohio, and took an MA [master's degree]
                    in U.S. history at Penn [Pennsylvania] State and did some summer work at both
                    Harvard and Oxford where my mother, brother John, and I took an unbelievable
                    lecture course in the summer of 1937 on England in the post-war world. It could
                    have been called “England Between the Wars,” but they didn't know that then.
                    They had a historian, I think he later became one of the well-known ones, as
                    chairman. Sir John Marriot spoke, Morrison, the labor leader, and Harold
                    Nicholson participated, as did Auden and one of the Loyalist Spanish leaders;
                    and one of the last lecturers was a then little known economist by the name of
                    Barbara Ward. [Such] was the quality of the course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to come back to that later. Was Wooster a
                        collegor university in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Wooster College.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved at all in foreign affairs there? What
                        wayour major?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: I had started off thinking I would be an English major. Howard Lowry, who
                    was my main professor, was a scholar who had been given the initial access to
                    some of Matthew Arnold's background papers. But, Eileen Dunham was a history
                    professor whose course on World War I and events leading up to it, made history
                    come alive, so I did gradually change and became more interested in foreign
                    affairs. Then happenstance - it is curious how it plays a role - the editor of
                    the Wooster Voice was Willard Hanna, a friend of mine, and a brilliant guy. He
                    said to me, “Bill, go down and see Dean Compton [who was the father of Arthur
                    Compton, the Nobel Prize winner, and his brother who was president of MIT,
                    Massachusetts Institute of Technology]. The college has always given money to a
                    college in India. Maybe we should be thinking of doing something new and
                    different.” I went down and interviewed Dean Compton and he suggested instead of
                    giving money here and there for students [in India] to support a teacher [to be
                    sent to] India. It sounds like collusion, but when they asked for people who
                    wanted to go, I was selected and I went to India. I was the first of almost
                    twenty representatives from Wooster to go to India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in India from when to when? McAFEE: From
                        1932-35.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>[There is] one episode on the way to India I have recalled many times during my
                    work in intelligence. I was traveling second economy class on the
                    Lloyd-Triestino - with a cabin just above the water line. It was monsoon time in
                    the Arabian Sea and I left the deck for my cabin, shared with a British Army
                    officer whose wife was in a medical institution. When I got to the cabin he was
                    lifting all the bags up on the berths - there were four or five inches of water
                    slushing around. The ship's captain had slightly changed course and the sea was
                    coming in through port holes. After closing those [in the cabin] he sat down and
                    said he had not had anything like this since the Western Front. He was a forward
                    artillery observer at a farm house well ahead of the British main line on the
                    morning of March 21, 1918, when the whole sky lit up. It was the start of the
                    Big Drive that almost won the war for the Germans. He moved to the front and
                    soon met a German who turned and disappeared in the fog, losing his coat as he
                    did so. Lieutenant Tomlinson picked it up and found it had a unit identification
                    - it proved to be a German crack division and this information was part of the
                    information that led the British to conclude a major offensive had started. Up
                    until that time such offenses were preceded by a long bombardment but Ludendorff
                    had decided on new infiltration tactics with a short barrage and an immediate
                    troop assault. John Kegan, military historian, describes infiltration as
                    anticipating blitzkrieg tactics of World War II - attack in strength and go
                    deep; Ludendorff himself characterized it as punch a hole and see what happens.
                    It was a change of direction and it almost caught the Allies off guard -
                    catching a change of direction - one of the hardest tasks in intelligence.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe India from the perspective of a brand
                        neAmerican college graduate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Your first impression is of the overwhelming poverty, just everywhere. It
                    was depressing, but you soon got used to it, sorry to say. I served both in
                    India and China and I am one of the few Americans who can say they prefer India.
                    I have always kept up my contacts there.</p>
                <p>First the setting - there is nothing in the world like the Himalayas. From the
                    foothills you look back to the main ridge always snow covered, and down to the
                    plains where you can see the rivers, moving across the dry and hot land and
                    understand why the Indians revere them. India had an ancient civilization,
                    magnificent monuments, and an active engaging people. At Ewing Christian College
                    where I taught, you came out of the clamor of the bazaar into the quiet of the
                    campus with its great banyan tree and [location on] the Jumna River. I liked the
                    country and my place in it. I greatly respected the missionaries - and they did
                    not fit in the picture many Americans have of them. Dr. Rice, Principal, was a
                    Princeton Ph.D.; Jim Manry, a three year magna cum laude graduate of Harvard;
                    Cal Hazlett after retirement and in his mid-seventies learned Spanish so he
                    could talk with the maintenance workers in his retirement community in
                    California; Dr. Forman ran a dispensary that the surgeon general of the United
                    Provinces called the best adaptation of modern medicine to India's situation and
                    needs; Art Mosher, who had to leave because of family health problems, became
                    head of a Rockefeller foundation - to name a few. The Indian staff included Dr.
                    Malvea, a Ph.D. in chemistry from Ohio State, and a Ph.D. in economics from
                    Cornell, C. M. Chattengee - many others had either U.S. or British university
                    training and degrees from India's major universities, and I liked and respected
                    them - mostly Hindu but with a mix of religious backgrounds.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed very much traveling around India, being part of its sights, sounds and
                    smells, trekking in the Himalayas, rubbing elbows with pilgrims at Benares,
                    seeing the Taj Mahal, which is beautiful at all times. I traveled third class,
                    carrying my own bedding and sleeping on station platforms between coolies and
                    cows, eating from the bazaar, but hot food and tea only. It gave you a wonderful
                    sense of being part of a very ancient civilization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the British role in India
                        during thperiod you were there, 1932-35?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>McAFEE: They were still very much entrenched. I remember on a railway station
                    platform talking by chance to some minor British official. He said that this
                    country was not going to be ready for home rule for another 200 years. On the
                    other hand, the British had laid all the infrastructure for independence. They
                    had a pretty good educational system in place. They had the railroads, the post,
                    the telegraph, stability to permit certain economic development, and a
                    bureaucracy that the Indians were in a position to take over. So compared to
                    other colonial empires, I think India was far and away more advanced.</p>
                <p>The Indian Civil Service was a desired assignment for highly qualified
                    Britishers; it paid well; you retired early. Whatever its effectiveness it made
                    the Indians second class citizens in their own country. I always felt that if I
                    were an Indian I would be a rebel if I had the fortitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you teaching and could you talk a bit about
                        thteaching experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Ewing Christian College [founded in 1901] was at Allahabad which is at
                    the junction of the Ganges and the Jumna [rivers] and is one of the three holy
                    cities of India. It was a good intermediate college. The head of it was Herbert
                    Rice, a Ph.D. from Princeton who had done work in psychological testing. He did
                    a lot of testing in India between castes which upset some Indians a little bit,
                    because he didn't necessarily find that much difference test-wise between
                    Brahmans and some lower castes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude towards a Christian college in a
                        holy Hindcity of India?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Actually, there were no problems at all between the Americans and the
                    Indians. The problem was between American missionaries out in the countryside
                    and what they considered the too liberal missionaries at Ewing College. There
                    was no emphasis on conversions while I was there. They had one required course
                    in either Bible or ethics, with no evangelical pressure. It was just a good
                    college that offered a much broader range of activities than the average college
                    in India. It had a lot of student-teacher contacts. Roy McCorkel, a short
                    termer, had students waiting in line outside his quarters in the afternoon after
                    classes to talk about various student concerns. As warden of Princeton hostel
                    with its nine Hindus, nine Muslims and nine Christians, I would occasionally in
                    the evening move around the hostel to visit with students. Years later in a
                    comment I still cherish, a former student noted how much they looked forward to
                    the visits from the chota (young, junior) sahib. They welcomed the Americans. It
                    had an excellent physical education program, rare in India, a lot of intramural
                    athletics, a debating society, and a variety of student organizations. Its
                    record was second only to the government college in terms of the people who
                    passed the final examination administered by the government. I think colleges
                    like ECC had a disproportionate impact on how Indians viewed America.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it coed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: No. It became coed about three or four years after I left. The Indians
                    still felt that the women were not intellectuals. I was tickled to see that the
                    outstanding student shortly after their admission was a woman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you teaching?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: The main subject a person like me could teach was English. The students
                    had had eight years of English and were going to have to pass a test on it. The
                    government had these standardized tests that everyone had to take at the end of
                    two college years; back then English was the Lingua Franca of the country. So,
                    you taught English, specifically those works that were to be the subject of the
                    tests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you under any constraints not to talk too much about
                        thdeclaration of independence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: When you went into India you signed a note as terms of getting your visa
                    that you would not engage in political activities. The college said that no
                    matter how you felt, to abide by it. So we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the students pressing you to find out more about
                        America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes. America they liked. England they respected very highly because
                    England had ruled them, but they liked America. On the other hand, they were
                    somewhat careful of expressing themselves. One scene illustrates this: C. M.
                    Chattergee was the senior and very able warden for the hostels. He came to me
                    one night and said to come with him to the station, so we grabbed our bikes and
                    went down to the station where he went up on the platform and told a student
                    standing there to come with him. We got back to the dormitory and C. M.
                    Chattergee checked his bag. He made one mistake. He left the door open and the
                    Indian students could look in. At the bottom of the bag he found a kukri, a
                    Nepalese curved knife. C. M. gave a sigh, closed the door and said, “Now we will
                    have to report this to British authorities because the students have seen it and
                    word will be around the college and the government has informers in every
                    college. If we don't report it we will be vulnerable for not reporting it.” You
                    didn't have long discussions on political topics.</p>

                <p>The British really had a hammerlock on the country. Above all they detested the
                    Bengal terrorists who would come up on a car, toss in a bomb and disappear into
                    the following chaos. I never heard an Indian express sympathy for them but I
                    wondered if down under some must have felt it was one way of getting back at
                    their rulers. Since then I have felt that fighting terrorism needed two prongs;
                    first to know who they are and to deal with them when possible; second, when
                    possible to seek to address the basis for terrorism. I am aware that in the
                    modern world there is for some extremists an appeal for terrorism simply for its
                    own sake.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Mohandas Gandhi a topic of conversation at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes. Gandhi was the most revered figure in India. He had been an attorney
                    in South Africa where he supported the rights of the Indian minority. When he
                    decided to return to India to work for independence he made several sound
                    decisions, unrealistically embracing asceticism, poverty and abstinence... Hindu
                    traditions. He urged India to return to cottage industry, making the spinning
                    wheel a symbol, and wearing a homespun dhoti [traditional slacks]. He selected
                    clearly understood goals. In his march to the sea to make salt he was protesting
                    the British monopoly and tax on it. His espousal of non-violent methods made him
                    a world figure, though in view of the British hold on India it was probably the
                    only feasible method. In India he achieved the rare distinction of being both a
                    politician and a seer. During my time in India, he was in and out of jail. Once
                    a friend of mine and I went down and bought tickets to Cawnpore to get into the
                    guarded railway station and we saw him from a distance. The students respected
                    and revered him; in some ways a more prominent local figure was Jawaharlal Nehru
                    who was from Allahabad. Nehru came to the campus one day and a colleague and I
                    asked if we could meet him for a session. We were told yes, to write him on
                    Monday. Well, as you might have known, on Monday he was back in jail.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: There was no recognition of caste at all by the college though we had
                    sons of rajah's, Brahmins, land owners and outcasts. I think we had 900 students
                    when I was there and only 27 of them were Christians. A significant number of
                    the others were Muslims, who got along all right with the Hindus. The students
                    had their own little messes, where eight or ten of them together would hire
                    their cooks, etc. After I left, a friend of mine, Al Kearns-Preston, started a
                    combined college mess, open to all castes which was sort of revolutionary in
                    India because you ate with people you normally wouldn't have eaten with. It
                    worked out and is still going as the main college cafeteria.</p>

                <p>McAFEE: I came back home and taught in high school in Patton, at Kiski in western
                    Pennsylvania, and at Altoona High. Then I went to Penn State to do graduate work
                    in history and was offered a job teaching in the local high school, which I did
                    while continuing graduate study until the war.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Summer of 1937. It was a most rewarding course. No credit,just great
                    lectures, and access to the Bodleian [Library].</p>

                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes, that debate had gone on, but I do not remember its being reflected
                    in the lectures, the seminars or the press. This was a more conservative setting
                    than the normal undergraduate one. This is a subject that would have resonated
                    with me. When I graduated from college in 1932 I considered myself a pacifist -
                    I could not imagine the means of war resulting in a good end. I gradually
                    changed over the years but Hitler put an end to any remaining pacifist
                    convictions. I remember a symbolic moment in 1937 when mother, John and I were
                    in Heidelberg looking down over the town and a sea of swastikas - powerful,
                    pagan, sinister.</p>

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>McAFEE: I went in on March 10, 1942 as a private; and as a private I got my
                    greatest percent pay raise in history. I was getting $21 a month and it went up
                    to $50. We left Altoona on a special train and the workers in the railway shops
                    turned out to wave and cheer as we went by. Half the recruits then got drunk. We
                    arrived at Fort Meade, Maryland, had a brief physical and were sworn in. It was
                    a totally unpretentious ceremony - we stood in a semi circle just at sunset and
                    took the oath. Somehow it was a moving experience. Later in the barracks you
                    looked at yourself and those around you and wondered how we were supposed to
                    face up to the Nazis. My army experience left me with the belief that the
                    military is greater than the sum of its parts. I continue to value my military
                    experience. Charlton Ogburn at one time in State, a man I liked and respected,
                    put it best in his book on the Marauders: “We belonged to that which is older
                    than any nation. We went back to the beginning of history; we were the beginning
                    of history. We were the soldiery.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: I was a private in the infantry, applied for officer candidate school and
                    went to Benning “School for Boys,” the infantry school [in Georgie], and became
                    a 90 day wonder. As a second lieutenant I was assigned back to Camp Croft, where
                    I had had my basic training. I heard at that time that [General] Stilwell was
                    looking for people to work with the Chinese army that had been driven out of
                    Burma and was to go back in. He had a training center set up near Ranchi in
                    India and I wanted to apply for duty with these forces. I was told I would have
                    to apply for combat duty across the board which I did expressing my desire to be
                    sent to India. I got orders immediately for troop duty in Europe. They were
                    canceled by orders to military intelligence on the India desk. There was a very
                    outstanding young officer in G-2 by the name of Bob Goheen, later president of
                    Princeton and ambassador to India. G-2 needed a good man to work on MacArthur's
                    [public theater], whereas India was sort of a backwater, Bob was given the new
                    assignment [to the Pacific] and they were looking for [his] replacement, for
                    somebody who had been in India. My name was on file, I had expressed interest in
                    that type of work and I was selected.</p>

                <p>McAFEE: In military intelligence in the Pentagon. The chief of the office was a
                    highly regarded Lieutenant Colonel Dean Rusk. It was interesting work. Actually,
                    of course, India was not really a combat area. I was the officer for the Indian
                    Army and I could tell you where every unit, company, battalion and regiment of
                    the Indian Army was. I wrote a history of the Arakan campaign of late 1942 that
                    some people agreed with, and some didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Field Marshal Slim's return to Burma?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes, though General Slim was not in charge of that operation. In his book
                    Defeat into Victory, he tells of initial planning for the operation to go 90
                    miles down the Mayu Peninsula split by the Mayu ridge and with many
                    opportunities for strong defensive positions. As commander of XV Corps, he
                    developed a plan calling for a ground force to move down the peninsula, a small
                    naval flotilla his people had patched together for end runs and Wingate's
                    brigade to come against Akyab by the back door. Eastern Army, however, decided
                    to take over direct command of the operations. They put no confidence in the
                    amphibious force and Wingate's brigade was assigned other duties by an even
                    higher headquarters. As Slim recounts it, things went well until forces were
                    only a few miles from the tip of the Mayu peninsula and a carrier patrol reached
                    the tip and reported no Japanese resistance. Slim then refers to “an unfortunate
                    pause in the advance” which allowed the Japanese to bring up reinforcements,
                    halt the drive and eventually force a British retreat. In the report on the
                    campaign which I wrote based for the most part on the reporting of Colonel Lash,
                    U.S. military attach� assigned to the area I mentioned, if memory serves me
                    well, and it is now 55 years in the past, that the main British force as it
                    neared the end of the peninsula and finding no resistance bivouacked for the
                    night at 4:00 in the afternoon and renewed movement the next morning, meeting at
                    that time the resistance from the Japanese who had moved back in. I expressed
                    the view that the prudent thing to have done would have been to keep on going to
                    secure the peninsula. I was commended later by a more senior officer (I was a
                    lieutenant) and others challenged my position saying the prudent thing for a
                    military force to do was to get secure for the night before dark. I was not and
                    am not a military expert and looking back see how easy it was for a bystander to
                    second guess the decisions in the field. I think General Slim's simple reference
                    to an “unfortunate pause” may indicate where he stood. Even Americans who were
                    in general very critical of the British had nothing but praise for General
                    Slim.</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>McAFEE: I did that from November, 1942 until October, 1943. If you ever want to
                    impress a man know more about his writings than he does. Colonel Percy Hotspur
                    Lash was the military attach� who followed the Arakan campaign, and wrote
                    reports. I devoured them. When he came back I knew the reports better than he
                    did. The Southeast Asia Command was set up by the Quebec Conference under
                    Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten. Brigadier General Wedemeyer was appointed deputy
                    for plans and was looking for an aide. Colonel Lash one day told me that General
                    Wedemeyer was going to give me a call and I should just answer his questions. I
                    went up to see him when he called and it was very informal. He came around his
                    desk and shook hands. He asked me a lot about the Indian Army and the northwest
                    frontier and the Army's performance there, etc. Then he asked if he could ask a
                    few personal questions, which he did. He asked if I would like to go out as his
                    aide and I said “Yes, Sir.” When I got down to my office John Christian, who
                    wrote the book, Modern Burma, and was my chief, looked at me and said that I had
                    just been relieved. It happened that fast. I then went out to India with General
                    Wedemeyer. My years of teaching in India were now going to give me a view of the
                    country vastly different from the one as a teacher.</p>
                <p>Q: Incidentally, while you were looking at India, the Indian army, were you
                    involved looking at the army of Chandra Base, the Japanese sponsored Indian
                    army?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: I did not get involved in the Indian National Army at all. They never
                    amounted to very much military although they worried people more than as it
                    turned out was justified. General Slim is high in his praise of Indian troops
                    fighting along with British forces but states that the Japanese eventually gave
                    up using the INA except in support, supply or deception.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went out with Wedemeyer from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: We left in October, 1943 and went to New Delhi. A curious thing, a friend
                    of mine who was in the Navy tried to get me to apply for a naval commission. He
                    said if I did not, I would end up in some mudhole somewhere. Instead I ended up
                    eating at the table of Admiral Mountbatten, which included Mountbatten and Sir
                    Henry Pownall, three or four senior Britishers and several Americans and a few
                    aides. Here I was, a junior officer, eating two meals a day at the same table
                    with Mountbatten and the high command and it was interesting, everyone being
                    open and friendly.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of Mountbatten's headquarters in New Delhi? There was
                    an awful lot of grousing about it from Stilwell in particular. He talked about
                    the imperial presence there and rather plush quarters and all. Stilwell did
                    everything he could to get away from there.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>McAFEE: There was always a Stilwell-Mountbatten controversy and later a
                    Stilwell-Wedemeyer controversy. All staffs tend to regard all other staffs with
                    suspicion, especially when the other one is a superior headquarters, which
                    Mountbatten's was. On the simple issue of [accommodations] there probably was
                    only a difference of what was available. Stilwell's senior officers lived in the
                    Imperial Hotel which was Delhi's best. SEAC [Southeast Asia Command] had better
                    office space in Delhi having offices in the government complex. I was told that
                    Stilwell's cook came from the Stork Club or the like - nothing wrong with making
                    good use of everyone's talents. When SEAC moved to Ceylon under the assumption
                    that it was to function as a forward headquarters it did have a beautiful
                    setting in the Peridenia Gardens. Stilwell lost no opportunity to show his
                    contempt for staffs. When he took over for a month or so in Mountbatten's
                    absence from Kandy he turned Mountbatten's Cadillac over to his cook and drove
                    himself around in a Jeep. Some thought it was great - others corny. It did
                    nothing to improve his relations with the British, which was of no concern to
                    him anyway, and was somewhat in line with his openly expressed contempt for the
                    Chinats [Kuomintang/Chinese Nationalists] and the Gimo [Generalissimo Chiang
                    Kai-shek]]. Of more significance was his contempt for staff work. An officer
                    from SEAC went to Stilwell's rear echelon in the Assam area, supplying
                    Stilwell's forces fighting in Burma and returned saying they felt very much in
                    the dark on Stilwell's needs and numbers. Stilwell was at home down in the
                    jungle in a combat situation. One thing that people could not do was to go after
                    Mountbatten personally. He had had a destroyer shot out from under him and was
                    the last man off the sinking ship. When Wedemeyer went up to China and took
                    over, Stilwell's chief of staff was General Hearn. After two weeks he said to
                    General Wedemeyer that he would like to stay on. General Wedemeyer had decided
                    on a change. Hearn said, “General Stilwell comes up to China, spends three weeks
                    and at the end he goes down to the press hostel and talks to Ted White and we
                    never see what he sends to Washington and he never tells us.” Wedemeyer had poor
                    staff [work] but good press relations.</p>
                <p>Q: Tell me about your first impression and as it develops of General Wedemeyer
                    because this is a foreign affairs oriented history and he was an important
                    figure in World War II in our relations with China.</p>
                <p>McAFEE: I liked Wedemeyer. He was informal, a brilliant man who did his own
                    drafting. He had been the initial architect of the concept that you couldn't win
                    the war by gimmicks. The soft underbelly wouldn't work. The only way to win the
                    war was to go across the English channel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The concept of the soft underbelly was that somehow you
                        shoulget up into the Balkans. This was Churchill's idea.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes. In his book, Six Armies in Normandy, John Keegan, British historian,
                    had a section on Wedemeyer and he said America and the free world were very
                    fortunate to have a planner who saw the way to victory. He said that he didn't
                    think we would have won otherwise. Wedemeyer had gone to the German General
                    Staff College and he knew their capabilities and that there was no easy way to
                    do it. Wedemeyer believed we had to go across and fight them where they were.
                    Keegan states that he had absorbed from the German staff school, where he had
                    studied, their distaste for peripheral operations, and that Wedemeyer's plan
                    largely determined where WWII would be fought. Keegan and others have commented
                    on Churchill's navy background and the long British tradition of dominance which
                    naval maneuver provided. Churchill also had looking over his shoulder as it were
                    the 60,000 British casualties on the first morning of the battle of the Somme.
                    Keegan concludes that Wedemeyer's plan was one of the decisive acts of the
                    war.</p>
                <p>Let me digress for a moment on the question of peripheral operations; in South
                    East Asia that meant Brigadier Wingate, who had caught the eye of Churchill and
                    Wavell with his guerrilla activities in various parts of the Middle East and in
                    Ethiopia, where according to retired General John Alison, he - at one point to
                    get around inadequate roads - bought over 70,000 camels. In 1943 he led 3,000
                    British troops on a six week march into Burma to operate behind Japanese lines.
                    Damage to supply lines was quickly repaired and casualties, often from disease,
                    were high with over 800 of the original force not returning. [Because] the force
                    depended for its security on mobility, it could not take along its wounded who
                    were propped up against a tree, given a canteen of water, some rations, a rifle,
                    and wished good luck. The British were able to make out of it a worldwide
                    propaganda victory and Churchill had Wingate discuss his further plans at the
                    Quebec conference in late 1943. For his second incursion, Colonels Cochran and
                    Alison were designated to plan and [provide] support, and they devised an
                    airborne invasion using ground troops, with gliders, and with light planes to
                    evacuate the wounded. Innovative and aggressive, they made a major contribution
                    to that type of war. Alison in a recent talk before CBI [China-Burma-India
                    Theater] veterans conceded the regular military did not have a high opinion of
                    the results, but he pointed out one interesting angle. When planned, the British
                    did not know that the Japanese were going to be attacking Imphal at just the
                    same time which was, as Wellington said of Waterloo, a near run thing. Japanese
                    generals after the war said the [British] operation which interfered with their
                    supply of the Imphal campaign had a significant impact on their failure.
                    Murphy's Law says that if things can go wrong they will. Maybe we need a
                    corollary law that says that now and then fate will smile.</p>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>McAFEE: At first I was only [Wedemeyer's] aide though I also worked in his outer
                    office. He shared headquarters with the British and there were many visitors
                    coming through. There were a lot of personal things to take care of on his
                    behalf. Later, when he moved to China, I spent much of my time as the assistant
                    secretary of the general staff in addition to working as his aide. In India I
                    had a great deal of contact with some of the British, particularly with my
                    [counterpart] aides. Lieutenant General Sir Henry Pownall, Mountbatten's deputy,
                    had been the deputy chief of the general staff and had been assigned to
                    Singapore just before its fall. I respected him. His personal assistant was
                    Foster Cox. Foster was senior to me, maybe ten years or so older, but we did a
                    lot of business together. He would try out ideas on me, will this fly with the
                    Americans, and, I would do the same with him. It was an interesting sort of
                    sounding board which he always said was very useful to them and I am sure it was
                    for us. I kept in touch with Foster until his death at 95 - my last contact with
                    the British in SEAC.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did Wedemeyer go to China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: He went to China in late October of 1944.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were in India almost exactly a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Wedemeyer's role in India during this year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: His major role was planning. There was a vast difference between what
                    Mountbatten wanted to do and what the Americans wanted to do. [These different
                    approaches are] still being argued over. Mountbatten and the British wanted a
                    series of amphibious attacks, the first one to be Rangoon, then Singapore and
                    Hong Kong. They figured that with the British naval superiority, these were very
                    viable operations. I went out on a strike with the British fleet in the summer
                    of 1944 which was intended to try to draw out the Japanese fleet from
                    Singapore.</p>
                <p>The fleet sailed from Trincomalee, Ceylon, in the morning. As we moved down the
                    harbor past other war ships there were honor details at attention and an
                    occasional small band playing. The [HMS] Howe was then on its first mission
                    after a thorough refitting at the Brooklyn Navy Yard; the sailors ate at small
                    messes here and there throughout the ship and at least one of the crew told of
                    visiting a U.S. ship and enjoying the wonders of a large cafeteria type mess. Of
                    more significance the British had participated with Americans in a prior
                    operation and were embarrassed by the greater efficiency of U.S. carriers in
                    launching planes - they were determined to approximate our effort. The Japanese
                    at Singapore were not about to come out and risk battle, so, after some bombing
                    of facilities on Sumatra, the fleet turned back.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>The Americans saw British plans as a strategic plan to regain the British empire
                    with American assistance. Stilwell had been driven out of Burma. One of his
                    first statements was that we had taken a hell of a licking and we had to find
                    out what went wrong and go back, one of the famous statements of the war, so, he
                    was devoted to going back through Burma, reopening the Burma road. U.S. policy
                    was to keep China in the war. Wedemeyer was sent back on a conference on
                    strategy in early 1944 and the British rolled out the red rug. They were trying
                    to persuade him to favor their amphibious operations. Wedemeyer had just checked
                    into the hotel when General Ismay, Churchill's military aide, was downstairs to
                    see him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: This was in London. Churchill, who did not go, had us all down to Dover
                    Castle as his guests. I missed by just one grade having lunch at Chequers.
                    Churchill invited Wedemeyer and a number of others to Chequers. Wedemeyer often
                    took me as the only extra one because you then didn't have any rank problem as I
                    was just his aide. But, in this case it went by rank and [the cutoff was] right
                    above me.</p>
                <p>One of the invitations of interest was when Prime Minister Churchill invited
                    General Wedemeyer to a dinner at No. 10 Downing Street and the General said to
                    me, “Mac, set up a car at quarter of.” The invitation was for 7:45. He said, “If
                    I start from here at 7:45, I will get there at 8:00.” I said, “General, for the
                    prime minister you had better be on time.” Anyway, I talked to his driver, and
                    she agreed the car should be set up for 7:30. We drove down and one of the
                    things that amazed me was the informality. You just drove up to the door at No.
                    10 Downing Street. At 7:45 he went on in and I went home. The next morning he
                    said, “Mac, you saved me from great embarrassment. I got there at 7:45 and at
                    8:00 the King walked in. If I had arrived there politely late, it would have
                    been embarrassing.” I mention it because obviously they were using all their
                    ploys to get Wedemeyer on their side on strategy. The British did a good job
                    that way.</p>
                <p>Wedemeyer then came back to Washington for conferences. The decision was for the
                    U.S. to put its main effort through Burma. The British simultaneously were going
                    ahead with plans for amphibious operations. That was the only way you could get
                    agreement. You can still argue the case either way. As Learned Hand wrote some
                    issues don't get resolved and recede into history where they are again argued
                    over by historians. Strategic differences may have been influenced by China
                    policy. The U.S. wanted a strong Nationalist central government. The British,
                    because of their colonial interests, in particular Hong Kong, were not fully in
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In October 1944 could you talk about the circumstances
                        thacalled for Wedemeyer to go to China?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>McAFEE: This, of course, is the whole history of the relief of Stilwell. Stilwell
                    had not much use for [Generalissimo] Chiang or his [Kuomintang] government which
                    he thought of as corrupt. He called him “peanut” when he knew it was going to
                    get back to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Chiang Kai-shek.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes. Whatever you think of a foreign leader, if you call him “peanut” you
                    don't really expect him to trust you very much. The history of this has been
                    thoroughly investigated and written. The Japanese in the spring of 1944 opened
                    an offensive to close the air fields from which the U.S. had hoped to support
                    operations in the Pacific and bomb Japan. The early success of their offensive
                    worried the U.S. Joint Chiefs. As pointed out in [the official Army history]
                    Time Runs Out in the CBI, they thought that if Stilwell were placed in command
                    of all forces in China, Communist as well as Nationalist, we might be able to
                    hold the field. Hurley urged the Gimo to accept Stilwell as such a field
                    commander. Though initially agreeing, the Gimo reversed himself. He was not
                    going to accord Stilwell such a command, among other reasons in view of
                    Stilwell's contempt for the Chinese Nationalists; a major factor was his concern
                    over U.S. cooperation with the Chinese Communists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might point out that “Gimo” stands for the abbreviation
                        ogeneralissimo for Chiang Kai-shek.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes. Chiang requested that Stilwell be relieved. The whole kettle of
                    personal feelings and animosities came to a head and Roosevelt finally relieved
                    Stilwell. Then, the theater was split. General Sultan became commander of India,
                    Burma and Wedemeyer of China. Roosevelt shelved the idea of having an American
                    as commander of all Chinese forces, possibly because the difficulties of such a
                    role were obvious, possibly because U.S. forces in the Pacific were moving so
                    rapidly that China bases were no long important.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went with Wedemeyer to China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: I was the only officer who went to China with Wedemeyer fothe initial two
                    to three weeks.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>McAFEE: Stilwell's closest associate was General Dorn and he was quite unhappy
                    about it. As noted earlier, the second in command. General Hearn, said to
                    Wedemeyer, “I would like to stay on because you bring me into the picture.” I
                    remember when Wedemeyer moved in the staff closed at 4:00 because Stilwell
                    didn't use it, didn't like staff work, didn't care about it. There was sort of a
                    mixed feeling. He tended to have the loyalty of his troops and the people he was
                    close to, but I think there was a sense that the theater was going to become
                    integrated into overall [allied] planning when Wedemeyer took over.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: To April, 1946. But in the late spring of 1945, I asked to be relieved
                    and I was with OSS [Office of Strategic Services] for about four months. After
                    training, I was assigned an operation on the Luichow peninsula [in southern
                    China]. The Chinese Nationalists were going to mount an assault on Fort Bayard
                    in mid-August so they could open up a port and the hump would no longer be the
                    limitation on supply. I was assigned to take a team onto the peninsula to try to
                    interdict any Japanese reinforcements from Hainan [Island]. Well, of course, the
                    tenth of August brought the initial indication from the Japanese that they would
                    surrender, but I was told to continue to prepare, but eventually everything was
                    canceled. I remember clearly reading the press ticker item posted in the mess
                    hall telling of the atomic bomb.I still have mixed feelings about OSS and our
                    assignment - I had a team of four: second in charge, Lieutenant Rich Anderson,
                    radio man, Lieutenant Greg Coutoupis, a graduate of Brooklyn Polytech, and a
                    weapons man, Marine Master Sergeant Bob Jones, and an interpreter, Private Fritz
                    Mote who went on to be in charge of Chinese studies at Princeton. They were all
                    good men. At Kaiyuan south of Kunming where we trained the type and amount of
                    training was left up to each individual team. Men like John Singlaub worked
                    hard. We did too, but you were on your own and I did not know much about work in
                    the field. After receiving our assignment we had a briefing on the strategic
                    importance of the area but no detail on the area we were to operate in or the
                    Chinese we were to work with. Colonel Ken Piers, OSS, gave me clear orders on
                    people I should see near the operating area but when I got to Nanning
                    headquarters, the initial Japanese surrender offer was in. I was told to go to
                    Pakoi on the coast and be ready to infiltrate across in case the operation was
                    to take place - that they wanted someone on the ground before the materiel was
                    dropped (we had loaded a C-46 or B-24 with arms and ammunition). I was gung-ho
                    for the operation then but looking back realize how unprepared I was on major
                    issues such as issuing rifles to local Chinese who were allegedly ready to fight
                    the enemy, controlling and organizing them, making sure they did not just
                    disappear with their new found wealth. Maybe OSS just figured that at that point
                    of the war everyone knew his business and I know OSS did a lot of fine work but
                    I always thought a more structured approach would have helped me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stick to the October, 1944 period to the surrender
                        of thJapanese in August, 1945. What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: I was working in the theater headquarters, both as aide to the General
                    and as assistant secretary of staff. There are things that you can do as an aide
                    that may be useful. After Wedemeyer took over in China, he became involved in a
                    dispute with Mountbatten over allocation of support - in particular U.S. air
                    lift capability. One afternoon he drafted a feuding telegram to Mountbatten and
                    told me to get it out. I read it and realized it would add a personal angle to a
                    policy dispute and took it to General Caraway and Colonel Frank Taylor. Both
                    agreed it should not go as drafted and then I suggested we wait until after
                    dinner and raise it with the General which we did. I told him the message was in
                    my safe and I could go and [transmit it] if he insisted, but that we all thought
                    he ought to redraft it. He looked at me and went to his room. The next morning
                    he drafted a strong telegram minus the offensive parts. A year later when we
                    were back in Washington he read the letter President Truman sent to Paul Hume,
                    the Post's music critic, who was caustic in his assessment of Margaret Truman's
                    recital. Truman had vented his spleen. The General said to me that in preventing
                    him from sending the telegram to Mountbatten a year before, I had earned my
                    year's salary.</p>
                <p>On a different note - Captain Upshur Evans in G-2 came to me one day and said
                    that there were American missionaries who were going to be cut off by the
                    Japanese drive against U.S. air fields in south central China. He drafted a
                    telegram which I took to the General, and eventually about seventy families were
                    air lifted to safety in planes that otherwise would have returned empty. Later,
                    a representative of theirs came to the headquarters to express their thanks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you observing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Wedemeyer accepted Stilwell's plan for the 39 divisions (later 36) and
                    their supply and for equipment for a certain number of Air Force units and
                    continued to press for more supplies over the hump. He wrote a whole long series
                    of memos to the Generalissimo, not only on strategy but on the Chinese Army's
                    pulling up its socks and getting itself into a combat ready role. He included
                    memos on pay for the troops. In the Chinese Army system the pay went to the
                    commanding general and he took his cut and everybody else took his cut and the
                    soldier at the bottom might or might not get anything. Also there was a great
                    reluctance on the part of the Chinese Army to shoot off its ammunition because
                    that was capital in the bank. I remember an officer from China coming back and
                    talking in G-2 Washington, when I was still there, saying he had gone into one
                    of the front lines where the Chinese and Japanese were across a river from each
                    other and there was traffic across a bridge back and forth. He said, “Why don't
                    you shoot?” “Well, we are in a stalemate.” Simultaneously communications would
                    be coming out of China about battles being fought, victories being won or lost,
                    which convinced a lot of Americans how vital the Chinese Army was, whereas,
                    actually it was just sitting there, saving its supplies and ammo.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Wedemeyer instituted a system of U.S. advisory officers with various echelons of
                    many divisions to try to ensure planning and directions and supplies all the way
                    down to the fighting units. This took a lot of effort on his part. He traveled
                    all over China and worked hard to try to get it into place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about relations, from your perspective, of the
                        DixiMission? Was that in place while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what the Dixie Mission was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: The Dixie Mission was our mission in Yenan, the Communist headquarters.
                    It was set up to provide intelligence on the areas of north China which were
                    under Chinese communist control or where they had guerrilla agents and
                    intelligence sources. Initially it comprised under twenty people - Army, OSS,
                    State. The Chicoms were highly interested in intelligence type gear, such as
                    radios which would help them communicate with agents and a great deal of this
                    was eventually supplied. They also pressed for as much recognition as possible.
                    Later the Mission got involved in planning to utilize the Communists in fighting
                    the Japanese, and provision of considerable amounts of arms and ammo was
                    discussed which greatly upset Hurley who was trying to negotiate peace between
                    the Chinat and the Chicoms. It was a center of all types of activity. One not as
                    widely recognized as the above, was a hope that we might improve our
                    intelligence on what the Nationalists were doing. For most of the Nationalist
                    held areas we depended for info on SACO (Sino-American Cooperative Organization)
                    which was responsive to the Nationalists. It was known that the Communists had
                    excellent sources on the Nationalists whom they considered the eventual enemy -
                    actually right up to high command levels. I have no idea how much info on the
                    Nationalists we gained through Dixie. I never got there. I almost did, but not
                    quite. Colonel Yeaton, who was a fairly right-wing American Army colonel, came
                    out from the U.S. with an assignment to go up to Yenan. He stopped and consulted
                    at Wedemeyer's headquarters and said, “Mac come along with me.” I said, “I would
                    like to, but...” “No need to clear it with the General, I just want a local
                    officer along with me.” I said, “You had better clear it with the General.” He
                    talked with the General and said that he was going up to Yenan with Mac.
                    Wedemeyer said, “With whom?” He said, “Mac.” Wedemeyer said “Mac is not going.”
                    I knew he wouldn't have anybody from his personal staff there, so, I never got
                    there. Yeaton eventually assumed command of the unit. Wedemeyer was not happy
                    with the lack of hard military intelligence coming from the mission and wanted
                    an expert on communism whose views he trusted in charge. Actually the Chicoms
                    probably were not all that cooperative in providing hard intelligence on areas
                    under their control. Intelligence was an asset [for bargaining].</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impression in Wedemeyer's headquarters and
                        knowledgabout the Communists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Wedemeyer had always been fairly conservative and very suspicious of the
                    communists. I think he felt the same about the Chinese Communists. I think there
                    was a sizable feeling among Americans that the Chinese Nationalists were just
                    not going to be able to cut it, a phrase in use was that the Chinats' mandate
                    from heaven had run out and therefore we ought to maintain our links with the
                    Chinese Communists, among other reasons to have whatever influence we might have
                    if they should come into power.</p>
                <p>After the war I was interviewed once by State security about the China hands.
                    They asked me about one of the officers and I knew that wasn't the purpose of
                    the interview because he was one of the more conservative ones. I took the
                    opportunity to say that I worked with all of the China hands and they were
                    brilliant people and when they had an opinion they signed their name to it and
                    put it up front. If somebody did that how could you accuse him of disloyalty or
                    subversion? I think what some of them thought was what we called Titoism before
                    Tito. I think it was a perfectly viable course. Stilwell's headquarters had much
                    less confidence in the Chinats than Wedemeyer's did. Then, when Wedemeyer got
                    his program started, I think the confidence rose some, but the underlying
                    concern about their postwar potential was always there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there pretty good feedback about what the Communists
                        werdoing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: There was constant feedback from the Dixie Mission in Yenan. Then, you
                    also had, of course, feedback from the Chinats, who were worried about how the
                    Communists were positioning themselves. Jack Service, who I liked and respected,
                    called me after the war to ask if I remembered a report that he had submitted.
                    Near the end of the war he [did] a report showing how the Chinese Communists
                    were positioning themselves in various locations where they thought the
                    surrender of the Japanese might take place so they would be able to get the arms
                    and ammunition that the Japanese were going to have to give up. I couldn't
                    locate it in State files. I told him I would be happy to go to the General's
                    files over in the Pentagon. He asked me not to at that point, so I never did
                    anything more. But this kind of report showed that people reported on all
                    aspects and did it well. This was a clear alert to Communist plans.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Q: You were getting these reports about the Chinese Nationalists reporting great
                    battles and great victories, yet, when we went down to look at it, it was
                    basically a static situation and a sort of a live-and-let-live thing. I would
                    think this would tend to diminish one's acceptance of Chinese Nationalist
                    reports. What about the reports you were getting from the Dixie Mission? Were
                    you able to verify what the Mission said the Communists were doing? Was there
                    the feeling that the Communists were fighting the Japanese and the Nationalists
                    were not?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: There was that sentiment, but we were uncertain how much the Communists
                    actually were fighting the Japanese other than in their attempts to get weapons.
                    I think both sides were doing exactly what we expected them to do. They were
                    harboring their resources for the fight against each other after the Americans
                    had defeated the Japanese. The great need of the Chicoms was for arms and ammo,
                    situated as they were in the interior of China. They had a very active program
                    of bribing Chinese puppet troops of the Japanese to sell arms. After the Dixie
                    Mission was [established] the program went into high gear. Yu [Maojun ] in his
                    book, The OSS in China, lists prices paid - $20.00 for a rifle, $30.00 for a
                    pistol, etc. Working through the Dixie Mission the Chicoms in late 1944 proposed
                    a joint U.S.-Chicom effort against the Japanese. Yu characterized it as a
                    Normandy style operation. At one point when Wedemeyer was in the U.S. his deputy
                    went to Yenan and a major program was discussed. The Chicoms were so taken with
                    the prospect of U.S. support that, according to Upshur Evans whom Wedemeyer had
                    sent to Yenan, Mao and Zhou En-lai proposed coming to the states to meet
                    personally with President Roosevelt. Those working on these proposals were
                    attempting to get as much help as possible from all sources in fighting the
                    Japanese, but it was also pretty clear that such programs would have major
                    impact on our relations and programs with the Chinats. An interesting sidelight
                    on a telegram Upshur sent from Yenan to Chungking. It started with a derogatory
                    phrase the Chicoms used in referring to Hurley. Hurley took major offense and
                    wanted Upshur relieved. Wedemeyer refused and it made for friction between him
                    and Hurley. The telegram showed that while negotiating with Hurley, the
                    Communists did not respect him.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you so involved in what we were doing that this was something you
                    realized afterwards or was this a realization at the time you were there?</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>McAFEE: I think a little bit of both. All of us had a lot of reservations about
                    how effective the training program for the Chinese Nationalists was going to be.
                    It may have changed a little after the battle of Chihchiang, one of the forward
                    air bases in China. The Japanese decided to roll it up [in a campaign during
                    April-June 1945]. This was not a major Japanese offensive but in the past such
                    forays had been successful. This time it was not. The Chinese Nationalists
                    turned back the threat and held the airfield. Romanus and Southerland in their
                    excellent official Army history Time Runs Out in the CBI describe the battle in
                    some detail noting that the command and liaison system showed results. Chinese
                    troops in Burma had fought effectively under Stilwell but these divisions were
                    American trained and equipped. At Chihchiang the bulk of the Chinese units had
                    minimal training under U.S. liaison and fairly little prior supply - [making
                    them] much like the bulk of the Chinese armies. The authors note several factors
                    at work at Chihchiang: no problems from Chinese domestic politics, American
                    [liaison] provided reliable information on movements, the 14th Air Force supply
                    position was good, and there was “an atmosphere of mutual cooperation between
                    the Chinese and Americans.”</p>
                <p>They note that at one point the Gimo by-passed U.S. liaison and sent orders
                    direct to the field. When Wedemeyer protested to him, the Gimo said the message
                    was only advisory. The authors note Wedemeyer's accomplishments were shown to be
                    considerable particularly since his system was not in full operation. The
                    Japanese in their summary of the campaign found distinctive the air lift of the
                    New Sixth Army and that Chinese tactics showed a “great advance.”</p>
                <p>Q: Within the staff, had some people developed an affection for the Chinese
                    cause, whatever that was, or did you find they split along liberal and
                    conservative lines in that?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: Wedemeyer was devoted to aiding and assisting the Chinese Nationalists so
                    I think the staff reflected that. There is a little sideline of history which
                    has been written up. Wedemeyer's chief of staff was Major General Robert
                    McClure, who came from the Pacific [Theater]. General McClure, I think when
                    Wedemeyer was back in the States, was up at Yenan and he really wanted an
                    all-out agreement to aid and supply the Chicoms for action against the Japanese.
                    McClure was probably influenced by reports from the Dixie Mission and OSS. He
                    came crossways with General Patrick Hurley on this. Hurley blamed McClure's
                    efforts for breaking up his negotiations to get the Chicoms and Chinats to bury
                    the hatchet - a hopeless cause on which General Marshall later spent much
                    effort. Probably the main criticism of Marshall's effort was that he continued
                    it long after it seemed clear that it would not succeed. At a dinner at General
                    Wedemeyer's, McClure had a little too much to drink and threatened to knock the
                    daylights out of Hurley.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Patrick Hurley who is not really a general but an

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes. He was quite a striking figure. I liked Hurley but would not have
                    liked being on his staff. One night when Wedemeyer was out to dinner, Hurley
                    kind of relaxed and said in effect, Roosevelt needs a new secretary of the Army,
                    Stimson is getting old. When I bring peace between the Nationalists and the
                    Communists, I just may get the Nobel Prize for Peace and I will be the ideal
                    candidate for that. I think he had in mind then that he would also be the
                    Republican candidate for president. He tried to get the Chinats and Chicoms to
                    work together. Later he changed totally and accused State Department people, who
                    talked about having the two sides work more together of being disloyal. So, yes,
                    there was all sorts of conflict as to what we ought to be doing, which was our
                    best way to go, etc.</p>
                <p>Yu's book refers to people who had been in China before the war who returned and
                    tried to set up their own intelligence units so that they could influence the
                    situation. On the military side the major split was between Chennault's 14th Air
                    Force, strongly allied to Chiang, and Stilwell. Joe Alsop, who was active in all
                    this refers to it in his autobiography. He was hated by Stilwell's people.
                    Wedemeyer, however, kept in touch with Alsop, valuing his intellect and
                    insights.</p>
                <p>Q: You stayed on through the surrender of the Japanese about six months. Were we,
                    our staff, playing any role about where the Chinese Nationalists were accepting
                    surrender and moving troops in, etc.?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes, in a major way. U.S. forces played a large role on helping the
                    Chinats deploy forces after the war, helping move over 400,000 troops. The U.S.
                    Army played the major role in getting the Japanese Army and civilians back to
                    Japan. We moved millions. Fifty eight thousand Marines guarded ports and rail
                    lines. General Wedemeyer, as the advisor to the Generalissimo, tried to persuade
                    him to limit his goals. He said you cannot take Manchuria and you cannot take
                    Taiwan and hold on to your position in mainland China. But the Chinats put their
                    best divisions there - at the end of a LOC [line of communication] 1000 miles
                    [long]. [Wedemeyer] suggested some kind of UN trusteeship for Taiwan and I think
                    the same for Manchuria. The Generalissimo insisted that he had to go into
                    Manchuria because his was the government of all of China. Wedemeyer told him
                    that by doing that he was going to extend himself and then at any point of the
                    Communists' choosing they could strike with superior forces and win, which is
                    what happened time after time. Wedemeyer really offered excellent advice to the
                    Gimo, but the Generalissimo and his people had their own agenda.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling and other members of the staff
                        aboucorruption within the Chinese system?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>McAFEE: There was a universal feeling that corruption existed not only in the
                    military but all through. I noted the generals getting all the pay and taking
                    their cuts before any money filtered down, with the lowest ranks possibly
                    getting nothing or very little. Trying to root it out was literally an
                    impossibility. There was a great sense that corruption and bribery were going on
                    with everybody getting his cut, that it was a way of life which I think it had
                    been for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling at that point that the Chinese
                        Communistwere really something different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes. There was that feeling. Yenan was a Spartan headquarters, clothes
                    were plain. It was a goal oriented environment and the Chicoms were smart enough
                    to capitalize on all these attributes. I think there was a tendency to idealize
                    them and this may have carried over to their views and programs, with a failure
                    to assess fully their devotion to communism and their zeal to impose it on
                    China. I am not at all sure that there was an awareness of how harsh the
                    takeover was going to be when it finally came, that they would be as thorough
                    and as intensive in wiping out what they considered opposition. Estimates of
                    those liquidated run into the millions - a forgotten holocaust. Many probably
                    thought we could do business with them and influence them more than we were able
                    to. The Chinese through history and various rulers had been able to maintain
                    their Chineseness. I think there was a feeling that one way or another the
                    Communists were going to put their own imprimatur on whatever system they ran
                    and maintain their own identity, that it would be Chinese, not Russian. There
                    was a certain realism among Americans in trying to adjust to what seemed
                    inevitable, and making whatever impact we could on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left China in April, 1946, what was your gut
                        feelinabout whither China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: I think my own gut feeling was that probably the Chinese Nationalists
                    were not going to be able to hold it together, although I was never ready to
                    commit myself to that point. General Wedemeyer had his last meeting with
                    President Roosevelt in April 1945. Again I missed by a hair meeting Roosevelt
                    just as I had with Churchill. Wedemeyer said he would tell the President he had
                    some charts and would get me in, so I waited outside the Oval Office. But at
                    that meeting Hurley did most of the talking and then Roosevelt had Wedemeyer
                    come back for a session by himself. He said to me that at the end of the
                    session, the President asked if he had any other comments and Wedemeyer said he
                    would substitute realism for our present approach to the Soviet Union. Being
                    close to Wedemeyer and working with him, I imbued a certain amount of that sense
                    that we were going to have difficulty making any kind of rapprochement with any
                    communists. So, I was schizophrenic. I wasn't willing to risk going the Chicom
                    route and I wasn't sure the Chinat route was going to be viable.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: I came back to Washington and in September joined State. A final comment
                    on the military. In the summer of 1951 my mother, my brother and I headed for
                    Maine for vacation and to visit Aunt Grace and Uncle Thompson. We crossed the
                    recently opened Delaware Memorial Bridge. I thought then, and still do, when I
                    cross it, of all the mostly young people who did not make it back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can I ask you about your impression of the embassy and how
                        dithey fit, particularly when Hurley was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Total friction. There was one episode which I was always sorry about. One
                    morning we were at breakfast and I received a phone call from the headquarters
                    saying, “Mac, do you know the U.S. embassy is burning?” I said, “No,” and I went
                    back in and said, “General Hurley, I understand the embassy is burning.” He was
                    irate that the staff hadn't called and told him first. They said they were
                    trying to save essential documents but Hurley held it against them for a long
                    time. They were at loggerheads at all times on all issues. The most famous
                    telegram, of course, was the George Acheson telegram while Hurley was in
                    Washington saying in effect that Hurley's strategy of working with the Chinats
                    was not going to pay off and they signed their names to it. They were all up
                    front.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Having worked with the people at the embassy, they suggested I come to
                    work at State. (The first person who had suggested that to me was Max Bishop,
                    down in Ceylon. He was the political advisor to the General). I went to the
                    office of Chinese Affairs for an interview and they offered me a position. From
                    September, 1946 until late in 1950 I was in the Office of Chinese Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was certainly the focus of everything at that
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: It was indeed. I had very high respect for the old China hands. They were
                    very able people and good people to work with and for. [But politics
                    interfered.] One Friday night [a letter landed] on my desk [signed by] eight
                    congressmen, charging us with selling China to the Communists, [deadline for] an
                    answer [was] Monday. [There was a cover] letter came from Mr. John Foster
                    Dulles, special assistant to secretary Acheson on the Japanese peace treaty. He
                    said he had never believed the charges that the State people were trying to sell
                    China to the Communists, but, in view of the evidence [attached to] his letter,
                    he now admitted to some questions. I had handled all aspects of the case.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>[Dulles' evidence was that when] a Chinese destroyer put into a Pacific island,
                    where we had a base, in early June, 1950, and the captain said that he needed 5
                    inch ammunition desperately. The base commander pointed to a tarp covering
                    surplus 5 inch ammunition. The captain asked for it and was told he had to go
                    through Washington before it could be sold to him, so, we got a note from the
                    Chinese embassy requesting 5 inch ammunition. I think Phil Sprouse was then the
                    director of Chinese Affairs, and he had a rule that when a request like this
                    came in we get it to the Pentagon that day, so I put a note on it requesting
                    info for a reply and sent it over by courier to the Pentagon. Well, the Korean
                    War broke out June 25, 1950 and the Pentagon decided that previously surplus
                    ammunition was no longer surplus. They told us there was no surplus 5 inch
                    ammunition in the Pacific. We said that in a note to the Chinat embassy [mean
                    to] hit Congress saying their man saw it and now the State Department tells us
                    there isn't any. It was the outbreak of the war in Korea that made the
                    difference. I wrote that back in a letter to Mr. Dulles and we never heard about
                    it again. But, we were constantly getting besieged with letters like this. It
                    was a pressure cooker all the time.</p>
                <p>Q: It was a critical period in domestic relations in the United States, the
                    McCarthy period and our China policy was under fire. Could you talk a bit about
                    the composition of the China desk when you arrived and how it evolved?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: The first chief was Everett Drumright. He tended to be the old line,
                    close to the Chinats. Then Arthur Ringwalt was the next chief and he had more of
                    the view that the Dixie people had. Then, Phil Sprouse and Tony Freeman. I don't
                    know if Tony was the director or the deputy. He was my all-time candidate to be
                    under secretary for political affairs with a great range of abilities. The last
                    chief was Edmund Clubb. They were bright men and I liked and respected them.
                    They were all outstanding directors. They all delegated. There was a clear line
                    of authority. I never saw any attempt anywhere to duck an issue though they
                    might get overruled. They had no great confidence in the Nationalists. Once DOD
                    asked for our position on transfer of some air force type material to the
                    Chinats. Thinking the directive was fairly clear that we were still to process
                    such programs, I drafted a reply saying go ahead. Then it got revised at several
                    levels. When it was finally signed two weeks later, Marshall wrote a note saying
                    he had signed but wasn't sure what he had signed. The Pentagon then said in
                    effect, we don't know what you said so we are going to go ahead the way we
                    interpret your response. Which, they then did.The reason I got out of Chinese
                    Affairs was that the FSOs of my age had 15 years of experience in China and the
                    language, etc. I had none of that and had no desire to try to become a China
                    hand. I handled basically military matters. I was the senior civil servant in
                    the political side, along with Walter Jenkins and Richard Johnson. Kathleen
                    Dougall was a senior civil servant, a very thorough and able person. It was a
                    very good staff at all levels and I enjoyed working with them. On Saturdays we
                    would be in just trying to keep our heads above water (from the work load) and
                    officers from other areas of the FE [Far East] Bureau, who has come in just to
                    show up, would come around to socialize. We enjoyed the visits but told them to
                    just wait and their turn handling countries in chaos would come, too.</p>

                <p>Q: Right in the middle of this period the Chinese Nationalist army was defeated,
                    Chiang Kai-shek moved to Taiwan. What sort of reports were you getting about the
                    Chinese Nationalist army?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: We got a flow of reports from the Pentagon. There were lots of them that
                    were fairly brutal and frank - not fighting, not defending a position, etc. When
                    the China White Paper was written...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This came out during the Truman administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes, in 1950. I knew it was being drafted but we were not formally told.
                    Finally I was called in one day and told that I had a week to add a military
                    chapter. I said that I had to have more time and they gave me a couple of weeks.
                    I worked day and night using mostly military sources for what I wrote. Instead
                    of trying to quote State Department officers, I quoted military aid directors,
                    generals and colonels assigned to work with the Chinats. For example, Major
                    General Barr, head of our military advisory group wrote that in the late forties
                    no battle was lost by the Chinats for lack of equipment - rather because of the
                    world's worst leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a conscious effort in order to head off attacks
                        at this particular point in time, the attacks on the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Exactly, I figured if you quoted a State man saying that they didn't
                    fight, etc. critics would say this was more of the same tripe, whereas if you
                    quoted a general saying it, that charge couldn't be leveled. It was essentially
                    that. Secretary Acheson put in a line in the introduction saying nothing we
                    could have done within reasonable limits could have changed the results and
                    nothing left undone contributed to it. Phil took it out and sent it back up and
                    Acheson put it back in. I think Phil took it out twice, but Acheson
                    insisted.</p>
                <p>Phil came back one day and said, Acheson was reading the White Paper and he
                    finished the military section and said, we really don't need anything else. I
                    think it was in the White Paper that we had one quotation from the Generalissimo
                    himself saying in effect how can you defend your position when your troops won't
                    fight. It was a conscious effort to show that the military leaders had come up
                    essentially with the same position as State. They might come up with a different
                    conclusion, to go ahead with aid, but they still faced up to the very great
                    weakness of the Chinese Nationalists.</p>
                <p>Q: During the time that you were on the China desk, 1946-50, how good did you
                    find the information we were getting, particularly handling military affairs,
                    about military battles?</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>McAFEE: I think the combination of military reporting and CIA and State reporting
                    gave us a pretty good picture. Once we got a commendation from the Secretary of
                    State on military reporting. Phil Spouse was up talking to Acheson and he called
                    down and said, “Bill, I need immediately a map of the Chinese Communist
                    positions, “ and hung up. I knew he had called from the Secretary's office. I
                    went back to see Walt Jenkins who said we had a map of their position six weeks
                    ago. We had both been following the situation closely enough so we drew a new
                    line saying since then they had taken this city and that city, etc. I took it up
                    and said, “This is where they are now and where they were six weeks ago.” It was
                    a total seat of the pants operation. The secretary said to Phil to extend his
                    congratulations to the people down the line. At this point it was useless to
                    follow the positions closely, the situation was deteriorating rapidly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a member of the desk, when did you start, or did you
                        start,feeling the heat of the anger from the Republican side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: All the time. As I said on one day I received eight congressional letters
                    which I had to answer. It was evident all the way through. It was a
                    controversial job at all times. There were two very different views on what we
                    should be doing and we were in a cold war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that there was any foundation for the attacks
                        oAmerican policy there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Not at all, in terms of the loyalty or integrity of the State Department
                    people involved, but there was room for policy differences. Some State officers
                    felt the Chinats were not going to make it and there was not much use in further
                    support; others thought we should stick by an ally and make a major effort to
                    prevent a communist take over. The opponents of State were picking up on things
                    like this. I talked to General Wedemeyer about this problem at one point because
                    I was unhappy at some of his testimony on the Hill. I said in effect, “General
                    you know you talked to these people during the war and gave them open access and
                    listened to them.” He said, “Yes, but I never accused any of them of being
                    communists; what I did say was if we had followed their advice, China would have
                    gone communist sooner.”</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel the hand of Eleanor Roosevelt in the policy? Particularly during
                    the war, Eleanor Roosevelt, who was sort of the leader of the liberal wing of
                    the Democrat party, did not seem to face up to the magnitude of the horror of
                    the Stalin regime. Did you have any reflection of her and her side of the
                    political spectrum?</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>McAFEE: No, I don't think so. Only a most tenuous incident has any bearing on her
                    general role. I remember a man [with whom] I went to officer candidate school
                    had shown a group of us a letter on White House stationery from Eleanor
                    Roosevelt to one of his compatriots. We were all duly impressed. Later, when he
                    learned I was in military intelligence, he got in touch with me because he was
                    under a security investigation for what were considered leftist views, and asked
                    me if there was anything I could do. I thought of him as a very able officer and
                    had seen nothing to make me question his motives. I went around to Army security
                    and was told, “Mac, drop the case, no use your pursuing it any farther.” He was
                    assigned as a post exchange officer somewhere.I don't know anything about the
                    case other than that some friends of his had some communication with the White
                    House. I think Mrs. Roosevelt probably was open that way to all views and
                    looking back on her involvement we respect her for it. But, no, I had no sense
                    of her involvement in China.</p>
                <p>Q: One always hears about the attacks on the Foreign Service, particularly the
                    old China hands and you were right in the heart of this. But, you were a civil
                    servant, did you feel any particular heat yourself?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: You were very much aware when you prepared a position paper that there
                    were two views and that history was going to be looking at everything you
                    wrote.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were using dignified phrases covering your
                        ass.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: There probably had to be some of that. On the other hand, I worked
                    primarily on military matters. For instance, my final assignment basically was
                    handling State's role in a $125 million aid program, which Congress voted
                    knowing it wasn't going to reverse the course of the war, but they wanted to
                    make a gesture, doing just what you said. At one point the Chinats came in
                    asking for a whole lot of highly sophisticated electronic equipment. I was
                    absolutely certain an order like this was going to be meaningless without backup
                    gear. My superior said, “It is their program, it is their decision. If they sent
                    in a formal request, get it over to the Pentagon,” and we did. Much of the
                    program went to waste because it went for much more sophisticated material than
                    they could use in a chaotic situation. I drafted occasional memos that were more
                    forthcoming from the standpoint of aiding the Chinats than Chinese Affairs may
                    have believed useful, but the memos were redrafted. The Pentagon then
                    reinterpreted them. Basically I think the old China hands stated their views
                    clearly and honestly, and as they predicted the Chinats did not make it. I do
                    not think any aid program which the U.S. was willing to muster would have
                    changed the outcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see a change in morale and ability to perform
                        towards thend of the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>McAFEE: No, they were solid hands. They knew the country and I think they had
                    confidence whether you agreed with what they said or not, that what they had
                    predicted was happening. I think they were ready to stand up and defend their
                    positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time too, Acheson was the Secretary of State and
                        was thfeeling that he stood behind them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes, Acheson tended to be very supportive that way. An interesting
                    sidelight on an incident. General Wedemeyer was asked by General Marshall who
                    was in China negotiating between the Chinats and Chicoms to be the ambassador to
                    China. He had sounded out both sides and gotten agreement. Actually the Chicoms
                    probably never had any intention to agree for they knew Wedemeyer was not
                    impartial. The General told me later he got a call to see Mr. Acheson who told
                    him that General Marshall had sent in a telegram saying that he withdrew his
                    request for Wedemeyer's nomination. It was dated about a month before that
                    interview took place but Acheson had continued to let Wedemeyer get ready for
                    the assignment. The General, rightly or wrongly, felt it was a purposeful
                    delay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave the desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: In late 1950, I didn't want to be a China hand and started looking around
                    and took a position as coordinator for current intelligence in INR, which was an
                    interesting but hopeless job. INR was hoping to preclude CIA from getting
                    control of the current intelligence field and after I took the job, one man, I
                    found CIA had over 300 people in their office of current intelligence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't to get away from the China situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: No. By 1950, China was down the drain, the Nationalists hasettled on
                    Taiwan and [assumed the persona of the government of China].</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>A comment on one job I had during my tour in Chinese Affairs. Arthur Ringwalt,
                    the director, had his hands full with China matters, and asked me to be the
                    bureau's representative on the Policy Committee on Arms and Armaments, which
                    functioned under the aegis of the Department's political military advisor,
                    General Crain with Colonel Swett as chairman. Its members over several years
                    included McGee, Timberlake, Hare, Labouisse, Sohm, Spencer, Auchincloss,
                    Matlock, Blaisdell, Cummings, Sullinger, Dahl, with Bob Margrave as secretary.
                    Our charter was to seek to limit the arms races particularly in developing
                    countries by limiting the export of sophisticated weapons, and for a short
                    period we had an impact. The concept was ended by two forces - one arguing who
                    were we, with all our arms, to be denying the sinues of national strength to
                    others, and the second more powerful argument that all we were doing was
                    blocking sales from the U.S., while others were filling the requests. We took
                    our work seriously and I am glad the Department at least made the effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: November or December, 1950.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we leave this, the Korean War started June 25, 1950. Were we concerned
                    that Communist China at that time might join in with the North Koreans or was
                    this not really thought about then?</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>McAFEE: I think the most famous dispatch was from Panikar, the Indian ambassador
                    to China who passed on a report that if we went up to certain areas the Chinese
                    Communists would come in. Of course, that got argued both ways. Some thought it
                    was a political ploy to dull our military effort. Others thought it was probably
                    a serious warning. A great deal of thought was being given to any and all
                    intelligence on Chicom's intentions. Actually, I think it was George Kennan, who
                    sometime before the Korean War asked CIA and the Pentagon for an assessment of
                    where the communists would strike if they decided to move militarily instead of
                    diplomatically. The answer, which may have been a special memo, was Korea. In
                    this case Kennan was right in saying he was worried about aggression and the
                    intelligence community pin pointed to the right place. My recollection of the
                    above is at variance with a study by Miss Cynthia Grabo on our early warning
                    mechanisms [in her book Warning Intelligence]. She noted that the CIA Watch
                    Committee was asked about two weeks before the war broke out to consider areas
                    as potential sources of conflict with the USSR. South Korea was listed after
                    Indochina, Berlin, Iran, and Yugoslavia. We on China affairs worked very closely
                    with the China hands in INR and other agencies in order to get as much
                    information as we could on Chicom intentions. I have no idea what conclusions,
                    if any, I reached on Panikar's warning, or what the position of the office was.
                    Miss Grabo notes that an attempt by indications analysts to flag reports of a
                    Chicom buildup in Manchuria was opposed by others who felt the Chicoms were more
                    interested in moving against Taiwan, and by order of battle analysts who found
                    the evidence inconclusive. She writes that not until after the first contact
                    with Chicom troops did the intelligence mechanisms take seriously the threat of
                    Chicom invasion. She notes that Mose Harvey of State (the head of INR's research
                    on the USSR) phoned her to ask that a report on the situation include reference
                    to the fact that the previous day in a celebration of the Soviet revolution
                    speakers had given unreserved support to the North Korean cause, implying a
                    commitment by communist powers to the defense of Korea. Miss Garbo notes that
                    the next week the joint committee studying indications of hostilities did
                    provide a warning of a major attack - about 10 days before it actually took
                    place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you left this job, what was our estimate of the
                        survivabilitof Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: I think probably the estimate was that on Taiwan the Chinats might have a
                    better chance. It was a more controlled situation. Because it would require a
                    substantial amphibious operation we weren't concerned about an immediate
                    assault. Edmund Clubb, who was the director of Chinese Affairs then, assigned me
                    a job, I didn't suggest or request it. He said to draft a directive for a
                    military advisory group for the Chinats on Taiwan now that the mainland had
                    fallen. There was a feeling they would be under the gun eventually, but they
                    weren't just at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, you mentioned there were a few things that had been
                        raisethat you would like to develop some more.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>McAFEE: A couple of points, first on the influence of policy on intelligence.
                    Some of my military friends contended all along that a meaningful military aid
                    program could have kept the Nationalist in power, whereas critics of Chiang
                    never gave him a chance. Later, a striking difference in intelligence estimates
                    occurred over Vietnam. An INR analyst wrote a paper that included a discussion
                    of differing estimates of communist strength in Vietnam before Tet. CIA, DIA,
                    and INR figured the insurgency base as 600,000 including militia. The embassy
                    and military in Saigon put the figure at 300,000. My guess is that the people on
                    the spot felt they were winning the war and this resulted in different figures.
                    It is part of human nature to read the tea leaves as you choose.</p>
                <p>Secondly, you asked me about the Indian National Army, a Japanese puppet force,
                    which caught me by surprise. Slim, in his book mentions the battle of Impal,
                    which was during March, 1944. Slim said that if the Japanese had been able to
                    break through into India they could have isolated Burma and China, and India
                    would have been sitting there ready to be stirred up, particularly with the
                    Indian National Army there. The Indian National Army had a division there which
                    performed ingloriously, as he put it. He said after that they were mostly used
                    by the Japanese as coolies and porters. My guess is that the Indians became
                    disillusioned with the Japanese and did not want to be their pawns. For
                    instance, later the British captured one side of a river and the next morning a
                    boat came across with two Indians who said their units were ready to surrender.
                    The British went across and the whole division surrendered. Individual small
                    units of the Indian National Army apparently fought well. Bose, the INA
                    commander, tried to get a pledge from the Japanese promising India its freedom
                    but they never complied. Slim had a high opinion of the Indian units that served
                    with him. I mentioned that I was the India desk officer for the Indian Army in
                    military intelligence. I once called on a general who had been the military
                    attach� in Russia, but who for some reason had been sidelined. I feel [his name
                    was] Famonville, but I am not sure of that.</p>
                <p>Q: It could have been because Famonville was demoted and kicked out of the Soviet
                    Union. He had been a major general and was demoted to a colonel.</p>
                <p>McAFEE: He had been in North Africa. I called him about the 4th Indian Division,
                    and he said it was the equal of any division in North Africa when it went into
                    battle and fought with distinction. Then it took approximately 15,000
                    casualties. He said after that as a fighting unit it was way down. Again, he
                    gave high marks to Indian units.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Let's move on. You went to INR when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: I left Chinese Affairs [in mid-1951]. I didn't want to be a China hand as
                    I mentioned earlier. I was then forty, too old to learn new tricks.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of INR when you arrived there in 1951 as
                        yosaw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: [Of course, INR didn't become a bureau until much later. In fact, in
                    1951, the organization was called Special Assistant, Intelligence, and used the
                    letter “R” as the organization's acronym]. Most of the analysts were area
                    specialists interested in long term developments. The research unit had been the
                    jewel of OSS according to Yu but it was still quite an orphan within State. The
                    basic group had come over from OSS, about a thousand people. State really didn't
                    want them and never made any bones about it. The coordination of sensitive
                    operations, which later I went into, was then handled by people who worked out
                    of the under secretary's office, so, that part was totally separate. I was
                    brought [into the Office of Intelligence Research, OIR] as the coordinator of
                    current intelligence and told to hire a staff. I interviewed a few very good
                    people and they were interested. I told them not to give up their present jobs
                    because I couldn't guarantee the money. We just never had it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time what was current intelligence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: A lot of people in INR hated the phrase. They thought you were demeaning
                    the real meaning of intelligence. They were devoted to long range research, the
                    basic trends and what may be coming down the road. Current intelligence meant
                    comments on day-to-day developments, supposedly as relating to the big picture.
                    I had a small current intelligence staff, who were part of other divisions but
                    we met once a day to approve memos. Let me give one example. Ted Wertime of the
                    East Asian office came in with an interesting piece. This was during the Korean
                    War and having studied the propaganda and several other [indicators], he said
                    that we could expect a peace initiative in Korea in the near future. I took this
                    draft to the senior estimates group and they said it was all based on propaganda
                    to which our answer was we were assessing all the time from Soviet propaganda.
                    But, they wouldn't put it out and I don't blame them. However, Ted was right;
                    the peace initiative happened within two weeks. This was taking a look at some
                    recent action and trying to make a comment that went beyond what other people
                    could see. We were seldom as prescient.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think when you look at intelligence within an operational organization
                    such as the State Department, long range research is obviously one thing but
                    when somebody asks what is going on you can't say that you will tell them in six
                    weeks, because the whole State Department acts on what is in the paper today. I
                    find it very difficult that there wasn't in some guise or other somebody who was
                    able to say that this is what is happening here.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>McAFEE: Actually, analysts were doing that all the time; we in Chinese Affairs
                    depended heavily on INR for both info and current assessments. Many intelligence
                    memos responded to specific policy bureau requests. Having been in a policy
                    bureau I know exactly what you mean about the Department making decisions on a
                    day to day basis. You are a little overwhelmed by the day to day demands and I
                    think this is one of the reasons why INR had such a rocky start. The policy
                    bureau might be interested in receiving a long paper but they weren't
                    necessarily going to spend much time reading it. A lot of them had their own
                    connections direct with CIA and Defense for estimates and for comment on current
                    developments.</p>
                <p>At this time both CIA and DOD had quite detailed daily intelligence publications
                    which State received at all levels, both in INR and the policy bureaus. Both CIA
                    and DOD had a regular and steady flow of individual reports from their people
                    oversees, subsumed and commented on in their publications. One curious example.
                    In early June of 1950 General Willoughby, MacArthur's intelligence chief, sent
                    in a field report that the North Koreans were going to launch an attack later
                    that month. In his weekly summary of intelligence [an intelligence unit in
                    Korea] said there was a constant flow of such reports and this one did not seem
                    any more reliable than prior ones. [Later] everyone was berated for not
                    believing the first report. There were plenty of people saying what was going on
                    - they just often disagreed. Tom Hughes, a former director of INR, in a short
                    pamphlet on intelligence noted that one of the dangers in everyone's thirst for
                    current intelligence is that it drives out consideration of more estimative
                    intelligence.</p>
                <p>When the first INR budget crunch came the first casualty was current intelligence
                    activity. I think the feeling was we had too small a staff to compete with CIA
                    and the bureaus had their own connections, so we were going to get out of that
                    field, but I think it became quite clear for the State research people that
                    their significance fairly much depended on how close they were to their country
                    desk and how much they were working on things that were of current interest to
                    the desk and senior policy people. However Tom Hughes cautioned against the
                    policy officers tendency to use intelligence as a drunk uses a lamp post - as
                    something to lean on rather than for illumination.</p>
                <p>The organization of State intelligence was under consideration at the time of the
                    Russell plan in the late forties which, as I remember it, broke up the central
                    INR units and spread the people among the policy desks. This was not yet
                    implemented when General Marshall became secretary and he reversed the order
                    saying that any good G-3 (operations officer) needed a separate G-2
                    (intelligence officer). After INR got geared up later on, its daily intelligence
                    summary which was all source compared very favorably with the publications of
                    the intelligence community. McCone, the DCI [CIA - Deputy Chief of
                    Intelligence], was very unhappy with his staff after a White House meeting with
                    President Kennedy during some crisis - Kennedy was working from an INR memo and
                    McCone wanted to know why such a fly by night outfit could get its material to
                    the President's desk. Hilsman was good at meeting needs of senior policy people
                    in and out of State.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Q: We will keep coming back to this theme all the time and obviously this is an
                    unclassified interview, but we are always talking about something that was 40
                    years ago or more. What was your impression of the CIA and what you were getting
                    out of it?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: I have always said that any outfit that had prestige and money can quite
                    quickly develop a pretty good cadre. CIA had a great public name. Their motto of
                    “Bigger than State by 48” they met. They had the money to hire people. A friend
                    of mine, who had left State for CIA, asked me to join CIA where he could get me
                    an immediate promotion. I had an interview at CIA but, he came back saying it
                    was much more fun working in State, which is more open and I withdrew my
                    application. But, they had the funds to hire people. I frankly felt, from the
                    first, that they were quite productive and often very good. When I was in
                    Chinese Affairs, we counted on the division of research in INR, but they in turn
                    were all the time working with CIA. State was certainly closer to CIA in its
                    appraisal of Soviet threats than it was to the Pentagon, for instance.</p>
                <p>Q: Let me pose something at you which came from somebody I interviewed on this
                    particular aspect. Somebody in INR was saying that in many ways CIA might have
                    the data, but the problem was that their research people were not particularly
                    action oriented. The CIA would get the information but their interpretation
                    wasn't very useful from the point of view of the State Department because the
                    State Department essentially had to act on this. Often the CIA people weren't as
                    aware of what the issues were from our side. We got far better information from
                    the National Security Agency where they had access to communications and our
                    people would know what the issues were at the time and therefore fit it into
                    what we were going to do as opposed to the CIA which would give a general
                    discussion that wouldn't be action oriented. Was this a problem?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: That opinion may have come from a signals intelligence specialist. CIA
                    and NSA were both highly valuable. I think over the years the most effective
                    units in INR were those that were close to the policy bureau. I think this was a
                    major advantage. They knew the papers that were being worked on and knew the
                    topics that they had to address to the Secretary. This enabled them to bring
                    their research closer into line. CIA spent a lot of initiative on meeting policy
                    needs. There were all sorts of committees set up to work out requirements so
                    that they would be responding to policy needs. But, there is no substitute for
                    proximity which INR within State enjoyed. (The National Security Advisor enjoys
                    this advantage too with respect to the President.)</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>On the question of CIA trying to respond, at one point, when Carter was
                    president, Turner, the DCI, had a big dinner out there to which the head of INR
                    went. Turner had a major slide show. The intelligence committees had worked for
                    weeks and weeks on what our priorities should be for the President, National
                    Security Council, State, Defense, etc. He finished his presentation and Carter,
                    who could be quite anti-establishment, said, “Well, they may be your priorities
                    but they are not mine.” So, all of a sudden a top level committee was set up to
                    find out what his priorities were. The White House was supposed to have a top
                    man on it, I think the National Security Advisor. At State it was going to be
                    the under secretary for political affairs and at CIA it was going to be the
                    deputy. They never met. Finally it worked down to working level types who said,
                    “Look, we have gone over the requirements so many times we don't have anything
                    more to say. If President Carter won't tell us what his priorities are we are at
                    a dead end.” In the requirements work, both CIA and Defense had large staffs but
                    it tends to become a mechanical exercise after a while. The Washington Post
                    recently had an article about a new DCI initiative to develop and serve all
                    requirements. The intelligence community spends great effort in trying to be
                    responsive to policy, but policy officers often won't give intelligence the time
                    of day. CIA, however, is traditionally closer to the NSC [National Security
                    Council] than any other intelligence arm which may account in part for the
                    strong White House support it enjoys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you work on current intelligence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: The first budget crunch came about 1953 or the beginning o1954 and that
                    was when the current intelligence staff was [disbanded].</p>
                <p>Q: When you first started were you at all operative or was this all in the
                    planning stage? Did you have a staff and were you supplying information?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: People out of the research divisions were detailed to handle current
                    intelligence and I would meet with them individually, and with the whole
                    committee once a day. We put out a daily intelligence comment which sometimes
                    had good material. It was intended to be as close to the policy picture as we
                    could make it, but, I never felt it was a very effective vehicle. I think our
                    product was better when the divisions themselves had direct contact with the
                    policy bureaus. When they disestablished a separate current intelligence
                    program, I don't think anybody lost all that much because in the current
                    intelligence field, CIA was too big and too competent and the Pentagon,
                    including NSA, was too big and too competent. In later years, INR produced first
                    rate current intelligence by making this a top priority.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get a taste of the CIA wanting to be more activist during this time?
                    This is an era of still OSS types who wanted to get out and parachute people
                    into places, etc. I think we are reaping some of the results of this today.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>McAFEE: I did not get into the operational activities until 1966. I had other
                    assignments for quite a long time. I am sure that CIA during this period was
                    very active on the operational side, but I was not involved in that. On your
                    comment about our later reaping some of the results of covert operations, one
                    comes to mind. When I was still in Chinese Affairs handling military activities
                    the office director told me that Frank Merrill, retired Army general whom I had
                    known slightly and respected, would be working with us and that he might ask me
                    questions. I was to be as helpful as possible and to ask no questions in return.
                    It became plain to me that we were mounting some program of military assistance
                    to the Chinese Nationalists covertly. The Communists quickly rolled up any
                    effort and the Chinats involved retreated into northern Burma where they used
                    their arms and ammo to seize control of the drug traffic in the Golden Triangle.
                    They remained a headache for years and may still be as far as I know.</p>
                <p>Another activity that I knew about involved aid to Tibetans to ward off Chicom
                    control of their area. Again, it did not work and there was a major problem of
                    resettling them. Having learned from the Chinat case the CIA moved effectively
                    in resettling the Tibetans it had worked with.</p>
                <p>After they disestablished current intelligence (around 1954) I had a very
                    interesting job as State representative on the National Indication Center (NIC).
                    State, DOD, CIA, the AEC [Atomic Energy Commission], FBI [Federal Bureau of
                    Investigation], all were represented. We were way down in the bottom of the
                    Pentagon next to the [National Military] Command Center [NMCC]. We had a
                    directive from Eisenhower to look at any and all indications of possible hostile
                    action against us or our allies. This was when the inter-continental missiles
                    were coming on line and people were getting worried. The directive said nobody
                    can deny any information to the NIC because of security, you have to provide it.
                    Everyone on the staff had to be acceptable security-wise to all other agencies.
                    It was a very interesting job. J. J. Hitchcock was the CIA director and a very
                    good man.</p>
                <p>Miss Garbo, whom I have mentioned earlier, wrote an excellent summary of the
                    Watch Committee and the National Indications Center for the International
                    Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence (Volume 3, 1989). Initially
                    assigned in 1949 as part of a two person watch effort by the Army, she later
                    served on the NIC staff for its full life from 1955 to 1975, being in many ways
                    it substantive backbone and institutional memory. A very able officer, she
                    describes indicator intelligence as preparation of lists of possible actions any
                    nation might take in preparation for hostilities, lists of assistance to both
                    collectors and analysts as long as they were not taken as bibles.</p>
                <p>Q: When I was in Yugoslavia we would check the foreign ministry and ministry of
                    defense to see if the lights were on on a weekend, which never happened in those
                    days. But, were we getting fairly good information or were we being alerted more
                    than we need be?</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>McAFEE: A combination. Your illustration of the lights being on, yes, all of that
                    came in telegrams on the movement of senior officials, or on a [possible] senior
                    meeting or on any kind of a military movement. There was a close watch kept on
                    the demilitarized zone in Korea, and certain military areas or on any
                    information that might [contain an] expression of hostile intent. This was not
                    only Russia versus us, but anywhere in the world where somebody might be moving
                    against us or our allies.</p>
                <p>One of the more amusing incidents came fairly early on when the Dew Line up in
                    Greenland reported hostile flight towards us. What to do? Should we alert the
                    top command? J. J. Hitchcock said he would go back and take another check before
                    informing anyone. They came back and said, “Sorry, it is the full moon” which
                    had just come up. Only rarely were there false alarms.</p>
                <p>We went on a tour to NORAD, out in Colorado, where they had a great big map and a
                    chart with all the possible indicators, economic, political, military movements,
                    etc. bearing on hostile intent. Then they had across the top of the chart
                    various stages of alert. When a light turned red it meant high alert. I remember
                    one of the operators saying if and when all the buttons turned red then the
                    President notified by NORAD was going to have a tremendous decision on what to
                    do. Nobody that I knew of felt that you could set up a mechanical approach to
                    produce decisions. The intelligence people up the line in NORAD had a realistic
                    view [-indicators could suggest when a decision point was close at hand, not
                    what that decision should be].</p>
                <p>Q: In a way we are talking about what happened to the Von Schlieffen plan in
                    World War I. The Germans had such a mechanized mobilization plan based on
                    attacking France and couldn't mobilize against Russia without attacking France.
                    Hence, World War I started because of a mechanized plan.</p>
                <p>McAFEE: Kegan in his book on World War I writes that attempts to prevent the
                    outbreak of war were frustrated by ignorance and misunderstanding of how the
                    mechanism of war plans, once started, operated. He credits the British
                    ambassador in Russia and the French ambassador in Germany as realizing that one
                    mobilization would have a trigger effect across the board. I share your concerns
                    over any activity becoming too routinized. Anytime any view or procedure gets
                    set in concrete there may be trouble. Winterbotham in his book The Ultra Secret
                    on the great value of our breaking [the] German codes, notes that [the Germans
                    achieved] surprise in the Battle of the Bulge [in part because we relied too
                    heavily on Ultra], since previously it had given us chapter and verse on German
                    military plans. Prior to the battle the Germans went to great length to preserve
                    signals security, so there was no Ultra, [on which we were fixated] to rely
                    on.</p>

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>McAFEE: About two years, from about 1954 until [March] 1956.</p>
                <p>Q: There were two things that happened in October, 1956, the Suez crisis and the
                    Hungarian uprising.</p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes, I was back at State by then [in the INR Office of Intelligence and
                    Research].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that if anything might have stirred
                        thjuices, this might have done it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Very much so. One reason I remember that time is totally inconsequential.
                    I was brought back as an assistant to Park Armstrong who was the head of INR. I
                    remember the flares. We were on the first floor of the New War Department
                    building, then main State, and the magnesium flares were lighted so TV could get
                    pictures of senior officials' movements. There was a real sense of urgency in
                    assessing the risks involved - whether we did anything or nothing. In the Suez
                    crisis we had leverage against the British and the Israelis, but the USSR
                    presented a different type challenge in Hungary. As you said, there was a high
                    level of concern particularly after reports that the Soviets had alerted
                    parachute units in southern Russia. Miss Grabo notes that a special meeting of
                    the Watch Committee chaired by General Cabell carefully reviewed available
                    indicators and concluded a British, French, and Israeli attack was imminent. It
                    came within 36 hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other intelligence issues while you were at
                        NIC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: There was intense interest as to any information bearing on Soviet
                    missile capabilities and their development of missiles. I was there for the most
                    part just before the U-2 became operational. I did not know about it, although
                    J. J., who was from CIA might have known about U-2s which came on line in 1956.
                    We didn't get the satellite that monitored the Soviet Union until 1960, but,
                    there was great interest on any intelligence concerning Soviet missiles. As you
                    know, Jack Kennedy made a major issue of a non-existent missile gap. I do not
                    know how much he was briefed before his election. There was major constant
                    attention to Korea, the Middle East and China. Miss Grabo writes that the Berlin
                    crisis of 1961 was a trying time for the NIC and Watch Committee. She also notes
                    the problems created from time to time by reports which had to be proven false
                    before they could be dismissed, like the one charging that the Chicoms were
                    about to declare war on Japan - a report from a proven fabricator. I would add
                    that during the Cold War there were pressures to see the Soviets as 10 feet tall
                    and coming over the ice cap the next week. A failure to be alarmist meant that
                    you did not comprehend the communist threat. The NIC and the Watch Committee
                    handled their roles under these pressures with credit.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: [In early 1956], Howard Furnas was the special assistant and I was his
                    [assistant. By February 1959], I became special assistant to the director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did this from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: From late 1956 until May 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the director then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: The director at first was Park Armstrong and his deputy was Fisher Howe.
                    I had a lot of respect for Park and Fisher. Park wasn't as tightly wired into
                    the Foreign Service or the top command as Hugh Cumming who followed him about
                    mid-1957 and was a regular FSO. However, various requests did come to our
                    office. I remember when Ed Freers, the director of SOV [Soviet Desk], came to us
                    and asked when the Russians were going to put up a satellite. We didn't know and
                    we put a requirement on the Pentagon and the CIA as to when it might happen. He
                    was very much concerned that they were going to get it up in the near future and
                    over the extent of the propaganda and momentum victory that this would mean. I
                    remember standing by the AP [Associated Press] [news] ticker towards evening,
                    October 3 or 4, 1957, when the ticker jingled and the Soviets announced they had
                    launched sputnik. Later, we found, curiously enough, that a study of Soviet
                    unclassified publications would have revealed the time pretty clearly. A couple
                    of electricians who were installing some of the electrical work wrote an article
                    in a Soviet journal which our people picked up and shipped back. Their
                    conclusion was that the satellite would be launched in the early fall. It was
                    right on the nose, but that was read afterwards. [Open source] publications can
                    give you valuable information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that Park Armstrong was not as well plugged
                        intthe Foreign Service establishment. How did that manifest itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>McAFEE: He attended the Secretary's meetings, but I don't think he was personally
                    involved with senior people calling him and asking him to run down specifics as
                    much as Hugh Cumming was when he was director with his seventh floor contacts
                    [who involved] him in policy discussions. Park was a good man and I respected
                    him. I think he ran a good outfit. [During Cumming's period, two things came
                    together]. You had a policy person who was ready to consult, and a somewhat
                    activist intelligence director who pushed and reached out. [I think Cumming also
                    got INR raised to a bureau. There was some reorganization of offices.] Roger
                    Hilsman was probably most outstanding in the latter course. He was exceptionally
                    active in keeping in touch with the policy bureaus. During any crisis he got
                    himself in the middle of it. During the Cuban missile crisis he made significant
                    input and received a high commendation from Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the INR team opposed to what
                        you werfamiliar with in CIA and the Pentagon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: It was a first rate outfit. The INR senior estimates group passed on all
                    the current intelligence pieces we sent up so I saw them daily. Allan Evans was
                    the chair, a very broad gaged person. Phil Trezise, his deputy, went on to a
                    distinguished career ending as an assistant secretary. Charlie Stelle was an old
                    China hand and went on to become an ambassador. Dick Scammon, ultimately became
                    a nationally known election expert. Clint Knox went on to become an ambassador.
                    Mose Harvey was one of the outstanding Russian specialists in the government and
                    after retirement headed the University of Miami's Russian Studies. It was a
                    great group. Joe Yager ran one of the most productive units in State. Forty
                    years later his staff has regular reunions. Henry Owen, secretary, later headed
                    policy planning and worked at the NSC. Charleton Ogburn became a nationally
                    known author for his books on the Marauders and on Shakespeare [Ed: The
                    Mysterious William Shakespeare: The Myth and Reality (1992)].</p>
                <p>Q: What was the feeling about the world in those days? I am thinking particularly
                    about Communist China and the Soviet Union because that is where things were
                    really ticking.</p>
                <p>McAFEE: I remember one of the long standing arguments with DIA was whether China
                    was a subservient partner to the Soviet Union. INR always said no, that the
                    Chinese put their distinctive stamp on everything. INR also felt, for instance,
                    that Vietnam was not going to be a part of an overall Chinese Communist
                    hegemony. It was communist but INR certainly expected that they were going to
                    maintain their own distinctive personality. [This debate gave way to another]
                    after the Soviet and Chinese border skirmishes. Bob Baraz, who was a Soviet
                    expert in INR, had on the wall a framed five dollar check from Danny Graham, who
                    was the head of DIA. Graham had bet that the Soviets and Chinese were going to
                    go to war and Bob bet they wouldn't. He was right. Neither the Russians nor the
                    Chinese wanted war.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>I know our Soviet specialists felt that however active Russia would be and
                    however quick they would be to take advantage of a break wherever it occurred,
                    that they were not as adventuresome as many people thought in terms of risking
                    war with U.S. The Soviets had their own power base and weren't going to lose it
                    by some impetuous act. We were more cautious [about Soviet aggressiveness] than
                    the military and somewhat more cautious, I think maybe, than the CIA. [Note that
                    on Duba] Khrushchev took such a risk and was later removed.</p>
                <p>INR always stressed the internal problems facing the Soviets with a small segment
                    of society living well and the rest on the edge but I don't think anyone in
                    State or elsewhere predicted the sudden break up that occurred. The Soviet
                    military had been the defender of communism but the drain it placed on the
                    economic system was a major contribution to that system's problems - there were
                    plenty of other problems too. [Just to leap ahead,] Bob Gates in a recent review
                    of Cold War intelligence noted that the intelligence community's projections of
                    the mid-eighties on Soviet forces and future developments were too high,
                    possibly as a result of the criticism from the right that they were too low. It
                    was during Bush's tenure at this time as DCI that Panels A and B were
                    established to provide an outside look, with Panel B coming in with an alarmist
                    view of Soviet military growth. It makes me think of the comment that everyone
                    is free to have his own opinion but not his own facts. Most analysts in State
                    (and in CIA's Russian area) thought that Panel B put its own twist on all
                    intelligence.</p>
                <p>Gates in his review stated that not until 1989 did CIA awaken to the possibility
                    of a collapse of the Soviet system. As he stated, they had a lot of company. He
                    does note that in 1989 in his role in the NSC he established a highly secret
                    planning group to prepare for a possible collapse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this period of the fifties, was there much attention
                        paid twhat was still pretty much a colonial empire area, Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: While I was special assistant to Park, Frank Wisner, who was deputy
                    director for plans at CIA, said he wanted to hold a meeting in his office, which
                    was then down along the tidal basin, to discuss Africa. For some reason or other
                    I was tapped to go. Also, is there a Leo Cyr?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he was a northern Africa specialist and later
                        ambassador tRwanda.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>McAFEE: He was there. Wisner opened the meeting by turning to him and said, “Leo,
                    tell us what is going on in Africa.” Leo said, “Frank, I am so busy [he was in
                    the policy officer] handling day-to-day issues and congressional's that I am
                    simply overburdened by day-to-day activities.” Wisner went ahead saying that we
                    had to pay attention to this area because sooner or later it was coming around
                    to bite us if we didn't. It was a good initiative and I reported back, although
                    I didn't have any idea what the next follow up was to be. It took a while for
                    the government to gear up. State then had one office to handle all of Africa. I
                    am afraid our concerns for Africa involved the Cold War rather than conditions
                    on the continent for too long.</p>
                <p>Q: Of course, really until 1960, with few exceptions, it was still pretty much a
                    colonial area. What about the Near East? Was there much attention paid to Iran,
                    Iraq, Egypt, etc.?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: There was always a lot of attention paid to Israel and the question of
                    its security. The general estimate, I think in terms of military capability, was
                    that they had the ability to defend themselves against simultaneous attacks from
                    all sides. An interesting question, of course, was to what extent the Soviets
                    would back their client state Syria in a confrontation. The Middle East was the
                    subject of all sorts of estimates, long term and short term, often
                    controversial.</p>
                <p>Iran became front and center when the overthrow of Mossadegh was engineered. When
                    you mention people wanting to get out and do things, I think that was very much
                    the case of CIA's Kermit Roosevelt's getting out and running what was considered
                    a highly successful operation to restore the Shah. In postmortems years later,
                    after the Shah was out and Khomeini was in, people said it might have been
                    better to have somebody like Mossadegh as a transition than what we got. You can
                    argue it both ways.</p>
                <p>In the fall of 1978 I was in Iran, as well as Turkey, looking into some
                    facilities problems. We were becoming very concerned about the stability of the
                    Shah's regime and the outlook for our highly valuable listening posts
                    overlooking Soviet sensitive test facilities. The embassy thought the situation
                    unstable and was awaiting the opening of colleges in a short time to get some
                    gauge of popular sentiment. Fearing violence against Americans who had been the
                    Shah's strong supporters embassy personnel took different routes to and from
                    work each day to avoid an ambush. The Shah had been pouring a vast amount of
                    money into highly sensitive electronic equipment and other gear suitable for a
                    sophisticated world power, raising questions not only in Iran but in parts of
                    the U.S. government, but again we were seized with Cold War fever - there was
                    plenty of reason for concern on Soviet intentions but I think at times we had
                    unrealistic assessments of some friendly capabilities.</p>

                <p>On Egypt, I remember after the resolution of the war in 1956, the question rose
                    as to how effectively they could run the canal. Some people felt they couldn't
                    do it, but we had no real alternative but to wait and see. Joe Alsop in his
                    autobiography traced the downfall of the old WASP establishment's influence on
                    foreign policy to U.S. actions at the time of the Suez crisis. In his view it
                    was unthinkable that we undercut Anthony Eden and the old line British
                    establishment.</p>
                <p>Q: If I recall, the old colonial hands and conservatives were saying that the
                    Egyptians could never handle the canal, they were just a bunch of wily oriental
                    gentlemen. The right wing were the status quo people. I think this was
                    considered a real issue.</p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes, I think you are right, but they ran it well. A major contact that I
                    had with the question of colonial independence movements came when I was
                    assigned to the Griffin Mission in 1950, the first aid mission to Southeast
                    Asia. Allen Griffin, an able conservative Republican publisher out in California
                    headed it. Sam Hayes, from State, his deputy was an outstanding economist. I was
                    on it because China was then down the drain, had been lost to the Communists by
                    1950. Jim O'Sullivan would have been the person who should have gone, but if Jim
                    had gone on the mission there wouldn't have been any backup, that is how thin
                    the Department was on Southeast Asia. I was delegated to go along as contact
                    with the missions. The current thinking was that Acheson was changing his stance
                    from letting the dust settle to being more aggressive on Southeast Asia. During
                    the mission, Rusk replaced Butterworth as assistant secretary for FE. Acheson
                    wanted to get first an economic mission to be followed up by the Melby-Erskine
                    Mission six months later, which was the military aid mission; he didn't want to
                    have the first approach to Southeast Asia be through the military.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>As Sam Hayes pointed out in his book The Beginning of American Aid to Southeast
                    Asia Acheson felt that given the disarray in the area many countries were
                    susceptible to subversion and penetration which could not be stopped by military
                    means. As Sam wrote, the Administration recognized that it must build closer
                    relations with the nationalists movements in the area lest there be other Chinas
                    for whose loss it would bear the blame. The shift in policy reflected two
                    concerns - containment of communism and economic development. Mr. Butterworth,
                    the assistant secretary for Far Eastern affairs had written an initial memo on
                    an aid program and secretary Acheson elaborated on it in early 1950. Sam notes
                    that the mission was not to propose major programs along the line of the
                    Marshall plan but to provide a “missing component” and that in all the mission
                    recommended aid totaling $66 million for various programs of economic and
                    technical assistance, involving for instance engineering units, medical
                    assistance, agricultural supplies, road reconstruction, publications and
                    training aids, etc. Hayes states that the recommendations formed the basis for
                    the Economic Cooperation Administration's initial programs in the area.Griffin
                    wired ahead and asked and got to see MacArthur, who I think later was quoted as
                    saying that nobody from the administration ever consulted him about Southeast
                    Asia. But, Griffin made it a point, it was the main purpose of the stop at
                    Tokyo. The staff met with General Willoughby. I wasn't at the meeting but
                    Willoughby apparently said that there were a lot of barefoot men running around
                    the jungles of Southeast Asia with weapons, and what we need to do was give the
                    French a word of encouragement and they would handle the situation, not
                    recognizing its nationalist component. There was a similar division to some
                    extent inside State. EUR wanted to be sure we backed France. Among other things
                    they [focused on] all that French land, and they looked at NATO and what it
                    meant. The Far Eastern bureau was convinced that these movements had genuine
                    support. That was a real division in the government.</p>
                <p>Q: They wanted to keep France in NATO and this in a way was a cornerstone of our
                    policy at the time. Did you feel this division in INR?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: Not really. The people coming out of OSS into INR were generally more
                    liberal than the average Foreign Service officer. Some had been intellectuals in
                    Europe and elsewhere and were inclined to be more aware of the genuine thrust of
                    nationalist movements and independence movement, I don't think there was ever
                    that split within INR.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this job as special assistant to about the
                        middlof 1960. Then where?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>McAFEE: [With the arrival of the Kennedy administration, Roger Hilsman became INR
                    Director. In May 1961,] I was assigned [as Deputy Director, INR Coordination
                    Staff,] to an office that handled both requirements and certain [liaison
                    functions] with the Pentagon (military intelligence) and with [the] CIA
                    (defectors). I had a curious, added, assignment. I was named the
                    interdepartmental coordinator for publications procurement. State wanted to take
                    over management of this essentially overt field from CIA. There were nine or 10
                    State [publications procurement] officers overseas and we were trying to take
                    steps to make them more responsive to State. That was just one of my various
                    titles. At this point I started [serving] more in the coordination mechanism
                    than I had been before.</p>
                <p>Since that time, I have had a soft spot for publications procurement. Shortly
                    after I took over, two CIA men who had been looking at publications procurement
                    in Latin America talked to me and were very dismissive of the State effort there
                    saying that in most areas it was non existent, only in Panama City was there an
                    active procurement effort. FSOs tended to give the program scant time but when
                    you think about the issue, you realize that procuring publications of all types
                    could give you an insight into what was going on and what others wished were
                    going on. Barbara Tuchman in The Guns of August wrote that the French got wind
                    of German uncertainty over the Von Schlieffen plan by reading German military
                    journals where the staff fought out the issues. As I mentioned earlier, we could
                    have gotten a fix on the first Soviet satellite launch time from Soviet
                    magazines. Putting it another way, think of what a foreign embassy can learn
                    about the U.S. from the wide range of our publications. An embassy can't spend
                    all its time reading U.S. journals, but sent home they form a valuable resource
                    on the direction and bearing of a country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from 1961 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: From 1961-66. With a variety of increased duties includinreconnaissance,
                    defectors and certain collection programs.</p>
                <p>Q: You had a real change in the administration going from the Eisenhower
                    administration to the Kennedy administration. Did INR feel this?</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>McAFEE: Personnel wise, but otherwise not so much. Kennedy did let planning go
                    forward as started during Eisenhower's days for the Bay of Pigs - which proved
                    to be a disaster. At that time such activities were handled from the Under
                    Secretary's office. Hugh Cumming was still [INR] director after Kennedy came in
                    and I think Hugh was quite anxious to hang on to his job. Roger Hilsman had been
                    designated to be the new director. Herman Pollock of personnel called me one day
                    and said, “Bill, there is a file on Roger Hilsman, a security file. I think it
                    is in INR. Could you find it and get it to me?” I said, “Herm, I don't have any
                    idea about it, but I will check into it.” I knew that the head of [the Office of
                    Current Intelligence, INR/DDM/RCI], special intelligence, had to vet any
                    clearances. I called down there and was told they had it. I delivered it to
                    Pollock five minutes after his call. This was my role in the transition. Hilsman
                    came in and was very active and perhaps his outstanding role in the government
                    was during the Cuban missile crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will get to that, but let's discuss the period before
                        that,which was in 1962. Your role is what at this time, 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: I had been transferred out of the [INR front office] in 1960 and was no
                    longer in a position to [see at close range] what was going on in INR [as] I had
                    been when [I was special assistant]. I really couldn't comment on Hilsman's
                    early days, other than that he immediately sensed that in the Department there
                    was a lack of what he called advanced planning. Back in the days of Kennan, S/P
                    had been very distinguished. [As for me, I moved up to be the Director of the
                    Coordination Staff in mid-1961.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the Office of Policy Planning [S/P]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes. I think by the time Hilsman came in, 1961, S/P was less highly
                    regarded. Harriman, assistant secretary, FE, came cross-wise with S/P over a
                    memo Walt Rostow had written urging the bombing of North Vietnam, and told
                    Hilsman he would look to him for planning. Hilsman developed his plan to have
                    his own long range planning staff in INR. He brought in Professor Whiting from
                    the University of Michigan and was going to detail Bernie Morris, who was a
                    solid Soviet expert in INR, among others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whiting was a China expert.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes, an able one. He was getting ready to build up a planning staff when
                    the first budget cut came. He had transferred the NIS people who did the basic
                    research on railroads, roads, ports, hospitals to other agencies.</p>
                <p>

                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes - National Intelligence Survey. We had a good many of those very able
                    people; he felt they didn't belong in INR and cut them. He thought when the
                    first major cut for the Department came he would be spared since he had reduced
                    the staff even though they were centrally funded and not budgeted by State. He
                    wasn't and he couldn't believe it. He lost his chance to have a planning staff.
                    Roger remained an activist and reached out to the bureaus and had good
                    connections with the NSC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the missile crisis work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: I was on the Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance and among other
                    activities we set targets for U-2 overflights. I had been involved in their
                    coordination from 1956 [while] in INR's front office. I am very glad to say I
                    had not been involved in [the] one involving the shootdown of [Gary] Powers. I
                    was being transferred out of the office as of May 1, 1960 and the papers on the
                    flight came in during the middle of April. I was not on that circuit. Before the
                    Soviets announced they had Powers, the [U.S.] government came out with a report
                    that a weather plane flying from Pakistan had gone off course and hadn't
                    reported. And, then, of course, the Soviets came out and said they had Powers.
                    Linc White, the spokesman for the Department was profoundly unhappy over being
                    misled. I hope I would have objected to calling it a weather plane, but you
                    never know what you would have done under pressure.</p>
                <p>INR/DDC (the coordination directorate) did work to get State and the government
                    to stick to “no comment” rather than getting involved in lies. The Pentagon at
                    one point planned the launch of five reconnaissance drones over North Vietnam
                    and prepared a cover story that essentially was a denial. INR took the position
                    that they would be detected by radar and might even be shot down. As a matter of
                    fact one or more were brought down in North Vietnamese territory and put on
                    display. McNamara then instructed the reconnaissance people to follow the “no
                    comment” line.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>We had trouble sometimes with chiefs of mission who wanted to deny that CIA
                    officers charged with espionage were in fact CIA. We did not want to confirm
                    that either and felt that the no comment on intelligence matters was more
                    appropriate. We were pleased when Rusk finally put the matter pretty much to
                    rest. There had been a considerable “dust up” in Singapore when CIA and the
                    military tried to recruit a member of the local security service, and proposed
                    he take a polygraph. He said he would think about it and left the building -
                    within a few minutes we had three or four [of our] intelligence operators in the
                    hands of Singapore authorities. Lee Kuan Yu, premier, tried to use this to
                    blackmail the U.S. for $150 million. Nobody went along with that. The situation
                    was resolved eventually, I think, through the intervention of Jim O'Sullivan, an
                    FSO [Foreign Service officer] and a good golfer, who was playing with the Sultan
                    of Jehore and took an opportunity to say we were not going to be blackmailed and
                    to get the word to Lee. Lee withdrew his demand the next day. It was agreed that
                    the U.S. would apologize and Rusk wrote Lee. Several years later the Secretary's
                    office called INR and said there had been a press inquiry about such a letter
                    which had been closely held. The people in INR who were called could find no
                    record of a letter and Rusk denied signing such a letter. We had to go back and
                    say he had so signed years before and he set the record straight and then
                    directed that the Department of State not lie and if anyone proposed doing it he
                    wanted to be informed. We used that directive to cement the “no comment”
                    approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were dealing with these overhead planes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any disquiet about these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: About flying over the Soviet Union, the disquiet was that we might lose
                    one. We knew that they knew it, their radar picked it up, but the plane was too
                    high for them to get. But, there was always the worry. Politically it was not a
                    big deal. The Soviets, I think, sent a note and SOV just didn't answer it,
                    figuring it was better not to say anything because they knew we were doing it.
                    There was disquiet; intelligence is often called a destabilizer, which, of
                    course, the U-2 flight was and Khrushchev used the May 1 incident to break up
                    the summit conference later with Eisenhower. On the other hand, it had been
                    stabilizing for a long time because it showed us exactly how few missiles they
                    had and what their readiness was. So, it worked both ways.</p>

                <p>McAFEE: The Soviets came within a hair of establishing a serious nuclear threat
                    to the U.S. in its own backyard. The intelligence community came under close
                    scrutiny for its failure to detect this before it did.</p>
                <p>First, a little background info from the intelligence angle. We had received a
                    steady flow of reports over many months about offensive missiles being installed
                    in Cuba and they had all proved to be false, so the community was naturally
                    skeptical about such reports. Also there was a mind set that the Soviets would
                    not take such a risk. A Special National Intelligence Estimate of September 19,
                    1962, concluded that the Soviet buildup was primarily for political purposes, to
                    strengthen the communist regime and its ability to defend itself. It discounted
                    the possibility of either a submarine base being established or IRBMs
                    [intercontinental range ballistic missiles] being installed as incompatible with
                    Soviet practice and policy. Mac Bundy in a later meeting with McCone, the DCI
                    who believed the Soviets were installing an offensive threat, dismissed the idea
                    of an offensive threat as incompatible with Soviet worldwide policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>The Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance planned the targets for the U-2
                    missions. The flight that detected them was on October 14, 1962. There had not
                    been a flight over that area for six weeks. The history of that gap became a
                    very controversial item, why there had not been flights. In that period, there
                    was a September 10 meeting of senior officials and CIA operators always
                    contended that Dean Rusk put his hand up on the map and said, “I don't want any
                    flights west of this line.” It was precisely west of this line the Soviets were
                    installing their missiles. One record of the meeting, however, said the
                    Secretary of State asked that we not combine peripheral flights around Cuba
                    which were legal with overflights. Don't have one plane do both because that
                    plane could then be vulnerable. He did approve four U-2 flights, two peripheral
                    and two overflights. There had been two recent incidents involving U-2s. One had
                    gone down over China and another had strayed over Sakhalin. Also in everyone's
                    mind was recognition that with SAMs in Cuba, the U-2 was now vulnerable. The
                    secretary hoped we could avoid further incidents just at that time. One record
                    states that Rusk asked that the flights be limited to the Isle of Pines and
                    eastern Cuba, and be over Cuba for a limited time. A later memo for the record
                    stated that there was general discussion on avoiding SAM sites and that the
                    primary concern at the meeting was avoiding incidents with the U-2 over Cuba.
                    The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board in its post mortem noted
                    that though it could find no proof of a policy to prevent overflights of the
                    area where IRBMs were discovered the operators were under the impression that
                    there was such an injunction. Whatever the case, the State Department concurred
                    with the need for coverage of that area in early October.When the time came for
                    a mission our committee set the targets and correctly specified the exact area
                    where missiles were found. The military and CIA deserve the credit for this. I
                    remember a clandestine service report telling of a visitor to Cuba who woke at
                    night to rumbling and looked out his hotel window and saw an enormous missile
                    going by on a truck. He got out of Cuba as soon as he could. Sam Halpern, a CIA
                    operator with whom we had long and very profitable relations, always claimed,
                    correctly I think, that given a short time the clandestine service would have
                    reported the missile sites, but by then they might have been operational. I was
                    called out to a meeting on the 16th and we were shown the pictures of missile
                    sites and told the President was being briefed simultaneously. Of course,
                    reconnaissance was immediately stepped up, both U-2 overflights and later lower
                    level flights. McCone, by the way, as you probably know, had been on his second
                    honeymoon in France prior to the crisis. He kept sending back messages saying
                    the Soviets were putting in SAMs and the SAMs were there to protect strategic
                    missiles. As a friend of mine in the Agency said, “We didn't give wide
                    dissemination to this view of his because we wanted to save the old man from his
                    folly.” McCone was right. His message of September 10 from France had a poignant
                    end. After repeating his view that IRBMs were probably in the works he ended
                    with the words that his bits of wisdom resulted from complete relaxation in his
                    incredibly beautiful environment.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>I was not involved in policy nor did I see the telegraphic traffic. Roger Hilsman
                    debriefed us later on one aspect of his involvement. A letter from Khrushchev
                    came in a day or so before the resolution of the crisis. I understand it was a
                    two-sided letter. One side said he was a man of peace and didn't want war, and
                    the other said they would blow us out of the universe. Hilsman said, “Let's try
                    the trollop ploy. She is working the street and a man comes down and says, 'Can
                    I go with you to your room?' And she says, 'I accept your proposition of
                    marriage.'” Hilsman said to answer only the part where Khrushchev says he wants
                    to be a man of peace. I think it was Robert Kennedy who gave Hilsman high marks
                    for this suggestion. So much has been written on the crisis that I hesitate to
                    comment from memory.</p>
                <p>There was a curious coincidence. The Saturday before resolution of the crisis, I
                    was in and was told in the afternoon to get over to the Pentagon and find out
                    everything I could about the shootdown of the U-2 with Major Anderson on board
                    over Cuba. I went over to the Joint Reconnaissance Center which was the center
                    of all reconnaissance activity and they said that wasn't the only episode. Not
                    only had a plane been shot down over Cuba, but a U-2 weather plane out of
                    Elmendorf in Alaska had flown to the pole and was supposed to make a 180 degree
                    reverse and come right back. It got off its bearings and the man knew he was
                    lost and came out in the clear over the Soviet Union, over the Chukotskiy
                    Peninsula and asked for directions and his base gave him his bearings.</p>
                <p>The Soviets had their most advanced missile bases in the Chukotskiy, which would
                    probably be activated first, and which we might have attacked first. A U-2
                    overflight of the Chukotskiy just then would have been most sensitive. There was
                    limited speculation that this episode may have been part of the timing that got
                    to Khrushchev and he said he would accept the terms offered. It was quite an
                    evening. You had the sense of a real crisis building up. Hilsman, I think,
                    deserves a good deal of credit for suggesting answering just the good part of
                    Khrushchev's letter.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had Cuba been pretty far down on the priority list of
                        youreconnaissance committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: No, Cuba always had a high priority. After we knew the SAMs were there we
                    flew the U-2 more often. The delay in detecting the IRBMs was caused by the
                    misunderstanding between State and the CIA as noted. Normally the flights were
                    every couple of weeks.</p>
                <p>I suggested at one point prior to the crisis when we were trying to get
                    information on the situation that we bring back a side-looking photographic
                    plane. We had cargo planes configured with immense photographic equipment. They
                    could pick up things well inland. I wanted to see a program like that started,
                    but, the Pentagon was using the plane out in Southeast Asia at the time and
                    didn't want to bring it back. I guess my general approach in intelligence
                    collection is to use the least sensitive means that will give us what we
                    need.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: I don't think the U-2 was used much in the Middle East. When the SR-71
                    came on line, the Blackbird which could fly mach 3+ and took an enormous area to
                    turn, it was used over Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria for a while with

                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: No, they were not. An amusing little side light. A friend of mine, Lucy
                    Witherow, lived in southern Pennsylvania, west of Chambersburg. She told me at
                    one time that the day before there had been a loud explosion which no one could
                    account for. Some thought munitions at the Letterkenny Army depot had blown up
                    but this was promptly denied. I knew the JRC was planning to deploy an SR-71
                    from Edwards to a base in upper New York. Its flight path came directly east and
                    it banked and turned over the area in question - the sonic boom being loudest
                    when it banks. Sorry to say I never saw or heard an SR-71. When it turned, it
                    took 150 miles. We used the U-2 over China, using Nationalist pilots flying out
                    of an airbase in India. When the Chinese Communists punched a hole in the
                    Himalaya Mountains, you could see the lights of the Chinese trucks which scared
                    the Indians. They became much more ready to work with us, and gave us permission
                    for a base in India. Nehru went down and visited the base. It was on his way
                    back that he had his first stroke. It must have been a torment to him to allow
                    the base.</p>
                <p>Q: There is a story about a U-2 making a forced landing somewhere in Utah or
                    Nevada or somewhere and out of this strange craft came a pilot who was oriental
                    and spoke only halting English. We were training him to fly.</p>
                <p>McAFEE: You are right, we did train some Chinats from bases on Taiwan. Did you
                    notice the other day in the paper that the Air Force admitted that back in the
                    fifties it had put out misleading reports in order to protect the U-2 and the
                    other high performing planes? When people would say these were new planes or
                    UFOs coming in, the Air Force, wanting to protect the secrecy of its programs,
                    put out reports which they knew were false.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: It was literally unbelievable. President Eisenhower is quoted as saying
                    “Angle permitting, we could read a car license plate from 70,000 feet up.” INR
                    did not have people at that time working on the read out. Later we developed a
                    limited capability from a couple of officers who were very able people. We
                    always got from CIA excellent reports. The only real conflict we had on
                    priorities came when one of the more sophisticated satellites came on line. The
                    Pentagon in effect proposed giving every commander an instant read out
                    capability, but was going to provide State the information by courier. We had to
                    put that up to the Secretary to go to Defense and say that we wanted to get the
                    information at the same time CIA, the White House and everybody else got it, so,
                    we were given the instant read out capability. By and large we got excellent
                    read outs from the Pentagon and the CIA. I think it was a Defense officer
                    working at CIA who first spotted the Cuban missiles.</p>
                <p>A comment on development of the U-2 which was a product of Air Force, CIA,
                    Lockheed, and Kodak cooperation, to name the four principal operators. Kelly
                    Johnson of Lockheed was the genius behind the plane. Since only the CIA at that
                    time had authority to make contracts without competitive bids, Eisenhower, in
                    the interest of security, made CIA the executive agent and within the Agency
                    Dick Bissell ran the program as well as the program for the SR 71 later. Friends
                    in CIA say he was a sure bet to be DCI until the failure of the Bay of Pigs
                    derailed him. He was also behind the first photo satellite, the Corona, which
                    [became] operational right after Eisenhower had suspended U-2 flights after the
                    Powers shootdown over the Soviet Union. The Cold War produceda phenomenal burst
                    of energy and imagination in the intelligence field. A CIA friend told me that
                    at the time the above programs were being developed the operations directorate
                    had a separate existence within CIA, having its own administrative staff etc.
                    right down to its own separate medical staff. Money was never hard to come by
                    for CIA.</p>
                <p>Most of the time intelligence achievements will not be so dramatic. Richard
                    Holbrooke recently quoted Kissinger as writing: “The fulfillment of America's
                    ideals will have to be sought in the patient accumulation of partial successes.”
                    Much intelligence work will be in the patient accumulation of information that
                    will enable the USA to make those decisions that have to be made in a timely and
                    informed manner.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the U-2 had picked up Cuban missiles were we using

                        elsewhere?</hi>

                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>McAFEE: We continued to use the U-2 over Cuba, but, of course, we soon started
                    low level flights that went right over the missiles at tree top level. The U-2
                    was used in China, as I mentioned. It was used over Russia until the shootdown.
                    It was used at one point with the permission and consent of a Latin American
                    government to look for poppy crops, and drug related things. It had a variety of
                    configurations that increased its usefulness in various areas and could be used
                    for collecting signal intelligence.</p>
                <p>Q: There was the accusation at one time that the U-2 was being used to take
                    pictures of French nuclear capabilities. Did you get involved in that?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes. It actually wasn't the U-2. That was a regular Air Force training
                    flight out of Germany which was supposed to come down on a routine run, on
                    international airways which passed very close to a French nuclear facility. The
                    problem in this case was there had been a fire in the control tower in
                    Charleroi, in Belgium so the plane had not been able to make it's second
                    connection. They decided since the flight plan had been filed routinely and in
                    advance with the French that they would just go ahead; they went down and back.
                    This was at the time when the French were looking for a chance to jump on us for
                    intelligence activities run from Paris, a Cold War intelligence hot spot. There
                    was a big stink. As a result of that, finally, we were ordered to prepare a book
                    on every intelligence activity and liaison we had in France or with the French -
                    State - the military, everybody.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes it was a tome. It would say routine things like at such and such a
                    time the sergeant in charge of communications at point X had liaison with the
                    French army, etc. There were countless entries, a lot of them about high level
                    contacts and major programs. By the time the study was completed everything had
                    wound down and the French had made their point. Chip Bohlen was back and up in
                    Tommy Thompson's office, the under secretary for political affairs, so I took
                    the book up. Bohlen was lying down on the sofa. He got up and shook hands and
                    lay down on the sofa. He leafed through it for a few minutes and said, “I have
                    no more problems.” I was glad for the answer because he was right, the French
                    had gotten off the issue, but it had resulted in a large survey and many man
                    hours of work. Having all that information in one book also probably presented a
                    security risk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the point of the survey?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>McAFEE: The French had made a fuss and had been assured we would look into our
                    intelligence activities to see if we were doing anything that would be
                    considered improper and that the higher authorities needed to focus on. Actually
                    the military pretty well coordinated all their arrangements regarding
                    reconnaissance, but you never can be sure that in the clandestine field people
                    aren't doing something, because even though they are supposed to coordinate well
                    through the station chief with the chief of mission, you always have somebody
                    senior or junior who will go off on his own if he sees the opportunity. Over the
                    years we have had periodic dust-ups with the French over aggressive collection
                    activities since many third country activities were run from France.</p>
                <p>Q: Now, we are talking still about the sixties. Within State were you picking up
                    any disquiet about the CIA and some of its clandestine activities, etc.? Was
                    there concern about the CIA doing things or was this an accepted thing?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: There always is a lot of concern. Up until Hilsman became the director,
                    liaison with CIA went through two channels. INR handled a wide variety of
                    activities involving staffing, cover, substantive estimates, U-2 flights and all
                    of that. Joe Scott was then in the under secretary's office, a special
                    assistant, and he handled the covert operations, activities intended to change a
                    situation, not to collect intelligence on it. Ambassador Cumming tried to get
                    both sides folded in under him which would have made sense. Allen Dulles told
                    him he would consider it, but it was one of those things he just kept
                    considering, which meant he was not going to do it. Hilsman and McCone initially
                    got along very well and McCone announced that Hilsman was the only man he knew
                    of in State who was really alive. McCone agreed to have all liaison with State
                    under one tent. Joe Scott at that point came into INR and became the deputy for
                    coordination, later that was the position I was in. I don't know if, prior to
                    that, the Department was unhappy about potentially risky covert operations.
                    Theoretically, the Agency normally accepted its responsibility to keep State
                    advised of covert operations. They knew they had to have the support of the
                    embassy, so [their activities] were normally pretty well coordinated. I think
                    the greater concern was in the clandestine collection field over what
                    notification the chief of mission should get on activity with possible political
                    costs, such as recruiting a senior foreign official. At one point there was a
                    proposed plan to establish a mechanism for coordinating all clandestine
                    collection at State. I was skeptical as to whether it would work, how
                    forthcoming CIA would be and whether we wanted a center in State coordinating
                    all clandestine activities. We felt the place to coordinate collection
                    activities was at the mission. It would be better for security and better for on
                    the spot knowledge on what the traffic could bear. At meetings on a directive,
                    we wanted the wording that “the chief of mission shall be kept informed as he
                    deems sufficient.” The wording, after high level wrangling, came out, “he shall
                    be sufficiently informed,” which left it up to CIA to decide what is sufficient.
                    CIA has always had support in high places on protection of intelligence sources
                    and methods.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>High level support of secret intelligence services is an ancient tradition since
                    they were the monarch's arm against all plotters. Some of this tradition carries
                    over into modern times. Winterbotham in his book, Ultra, speaks of the chief of
                    the British Secret Intelligence Service in World War II as the last chief to
                    defend the absolute independence of the Secret Service.</p>
                <p>I think there was always concern about a CIA staff overseas as big as the rest of
                    the embassy in some places, [looking] for targets, serving under State cover
                    while running a mostly overt clandestine service. You mentioned the large CIA
                    staffs. One ongoing problem involved cover. When CIA was set up, [it] envisioned
                    State cover as temporary until [it] could get good private cover, but soon found
                    they liked [it]. It gave [CIA officers] a secure working area, secure
                    communications, access, and diplomatic immunity. CIA always admitted that cover
                    would wear thin - that it was expendable. Congress and the press tended to beat
                    on us at times, particularly after major incidents like the assassination of Mr.
                    Welch, the station chief in Athens. Actually CIA had recommended that he not
                    live in the traditional COS house and the State policy bureau did likewise, but
                    he preferred it and was shot outside it. State I think over the years has done a
                    good job of facilitating cover arrangements. The location of the CIA station in
                    an embassy raises a variety of questions including how much the local staff can
                    observe comings and goings. It is prudent to accept the fact that in most
                    countries and particularly in hostile or closed societies, the staffs of local
                    employees will have contact with their own countries' security services. When I
                    was in Brazil in 1980 I was favorably impressed by arrangements Bob Sayre, the
                    COM [chief of mission], had worked out. The bulk of the station immediately
                    adjoined the political section and had a door permitting them direct access to
                    that section and to the ambassador's offices. Access the other way was
                    controlled. Both sides felt it served both cover and access, and I suggested on
                    return to Washington that CIA and State's Foreign Building Office maintain close
                    contact as plans were made for new embassy buildings or for adjustments in older
                    ones.</p>
                <p>There have been embarrassing incidents involving cover. An AID director on the
                    Hill stated that there were no CIA people under AID cover. We had to provide his
                    office with the figures and he really would have liked them out of their posts
                    literally overnight. We persuaded him that this would draw more attention to the
                    problem than anything else we could do; he agreed and we phased them out over a
                    period of time. Sometimes sensitivity over any connection with CIA interfered
                    with potentially useful initiatives. Doug Heck, ambassador to Niger talked to me
                    about using satellite photography in planning aid programs. He said they had
                    scanty reliable information on rivers, whether the desert was advancing or
                    retreating, on land and on back country roads, etc. We checked and found it
                    would be possible to collect this information routinely and without cost to
                    other programs. CIA immediately agreed to put up to several man years on such a
                    project - using read out specialists. The AID director objected to the program
                    because he feared an AID-CIA link. We then discussed in general the idea of
                    non-military use of such photography, but never actively followed up.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>Q: One of the things that I get from my interviews is that, yes, the CIA had
                    large staffs and all, but they are essentially reporting on the same thing and
                    that very little of value came out of these intelligence sources, most of which
                    were the same sources that the regular diplomatic officer would have.</p>
                <p>McAFEE: I went down to Latin America in 1962, when Mr. Bowles was the under
                    secretary - - he had these meetings in foreign countries where a number of
                    chiefs of mission would come in as well as the CIA station chiefs, and attaches,
                    and people came out from Washington. When the one was set for Latin America, I
                    was tapped to go. I remember talking to the political counselor at Lima and he
                    said that the thing that [exasperated him was] when you had a good overt source
                    in the host government and he dries up and you wonder what has happened. Then
                    you see him going down the hall into the closed doors of the CIA and you know he
                    is getting paid for what he gave you openly before. It was a great thorn and
                    irritation. Why give anything for free if you can get money for it? Many overt
                    sources disappeared this way but CIA also developed valuable intelligence from
                    sources State could not have reached.</p>
                <p>One of the duties I enjoyed was briefing chiefs of mission on intelligence
                    activities at the post. I was briefing Ambassador Annenberg who was going to
                    London. Part way through he [announced] I had been born 30 miles either side of
                    our border with Canada in the Calais-St. Stephens area. Actually, my mother had
                    been born in Canada 30 miles from that border. Most COMs took their intelligence
                    responsibilities seriously, and discussed intelligence problems with State
                    through the Roger Channel.</p>
                <p>Q: Also, there is always the problem that I mentioned before that the basic
                    relations between a foreign country and the United States is through the State
                    Department and CIA is on the periphery. So, if the CIA is working somebody they
                    are not really as close to the problem as the State Department person.</p>
                <p>McAFEE: That is very often the case. On the other hand, many foreign officials
                    felt CIA had better channels to the White House and cultivated contact with
                    their staffs. Also in many countries the security services on which the
                    executive depended and with which CIA was in liaison knew better what was really
                    going on than the foreign office did. Another problem made it exceptionally hard
                    for the chief of mission to evaluate staffing of an operation. A great many of
                    CIA's personnel were justified on the basis of third country activities. In,
                    say, Luanda we might be able to recruit a Soviet who would be useful later when
                    he was in Europe so, there was a vast amount of recruitment going on of no
                    interest then to the Department or post, with potential for disrupting local
                    relationships but with possible later value. It was very hard to make
                    assessments of this nature. They were operating on a totally different wave
                    length in some of these cases.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Now and then it was suggested that State seek to get the authority for the COM to
                    have access to the operational communications of all agencies. It would provide
                    the best possible handle for the COM to learn of sensitive activities that might
                    have political costs. I believed that since these messages contained information
                    on sources and methods that CIA and the FBI would object and would be backed by
                    higher authority. Ed Peck, at one point COM in Mauritania, during Gray's tenure
                    as head of the FBI raised an issue on a specific activity concerning the COM's
                    access to their communications. I did not think the FBI would accede, but in
                    this case they did. Ed won that battle but it did not result in any State-FBI
                    agreement making this a standard operating procedure. Ed later told me that the
                    FBI wrote State in protest. I think we are going to have to look elsewhere for
                    coordinating mechanisms.</p>
                <p>Q: During your time in INR was there any effort to try to make sure that we
                    weren't paying the same person for information or that these things were
                    coordinated so that CIA went after sources that we couldn't get to?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: During an Indonesian crisis in the late fifties both the military and CIA
                    felt they had a good clandestine source, which they did. After a while he got
                    lazy and just handed over the same version of his reports to each service and
                    the duplication was quickly noticed - he had been getting paid by two services.
                    We in State did not have a good handle with which to work this problem - it
                    would have required a major concentration of sensitive collection of information
                    back here. It is a problem that should be handled between the embassy and the
                    COS. Back here basic efforts centered on the directives governing
                    coordination.</p>
                <p>A major change in State - CIA relations came with Kennedy's letter to chiefs of
                    mission where he stated that they were in charge of all activities of all
                    agencies. Allen Dulles then approached the White House for a second letter
                    saying except for intelligence. President Kennedy made it plain that he wanted
                    all agencies included. CIA then told its station chiefs that just as they had
                    coordinated covert action proposals they should now similarly coordinate
                    clandestine collection activities and programs with the COM.</p>
                <p>A redrafting of the National Security Intelligence Directive on clandestine
                    collection was then undertaken. That was where State tried to get the language
                    that the chief of mission should be kept sufficiently informed - I think the
                    wording was after consultation with the Secretary of State. Finally arrangements
                    were worked out that people the chief of mission might be seeing who were in CIA
                    pay would be notified to him. We didn't want our chief of mission unknowingly
                    dealing with Mr. X who is already being paid for passing info to the station
                    chief. But CIA was fairly adamant about too much notification. They said, “If we
                    recruit this young man in the foreign office, who is a junior officer, he may
                    not be of use to us for twenty years. But, if too many people know he is in our
                    pay, he is going to be put into jeopardy.” I think they had a good case. We had
                    cases where political ambassadors, I don't think it ever happened with a career
                    ambassador, came back and wrote books where they did name people.</p>

                        SmitHempstone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes, The Reds and the Blacks. He felt the people hmentioned were already
                    known.</p>
                <p>Q: This is a recurrent problem for the Foreign Service. We may have a very
                    professional staff capable of handling sensitive matters, but you can have a
                    real horse's ass as the head of it because of political appointments and nobody
                    in his right mind in any case would entrust him. It doesn't mean we haven't had
                    very good people as political ambassadors, but we have had some who are just
                    really social dilettantes or the equivalent to American remittance men.</p>
                <p>McAFEE: By and large, in those cases, it becomes routine for the DCM to handle
                    coordination and CIA prefers it in that sort of a situation. And they then
                    accord the DCM most of the privileges that are reserved for the chief of
                    mission. CIA often had good relations with political appointees, sometimes
                    because of their links to the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this done without consultation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: This is more or less done as a matter of working relationships. The most
                    definitive document on the question of coordination as mentioned was Kennedy's
                    letter. I think State's main concern has been clandestine collection as opposed
                    to covert operations. The main covert operations that have gone astray however,
                    and this sounds like a State self-serving comment, are ones that were run at
                    least around INR. In a normal mechanism the Chile program would have been more
                    thoroughly cleared.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: That is right. Kissinger is a great writer. In his book, The White House
                    Years, he mentioned that he had not paid particular attention to Chile. He was
                    involved in other things. And, Nixon hadn't paid attention. Kissinger said he
                    received this briefing from CIA which said in effect, there will be an election
                    in a couple of days that may make certain that there will be a communist
                    government in Chile. Kissinger said he never had focused on it and had to go in
                    and tell the President that this was about to take place. I was the backbencher
                    on the Forty Committee then, Alex Johnson was State's Forty Committee
                    representative.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Forty Committee being?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>McAFEE: This was the senior level committee that coordinated covert operations or
                    highly sensitive intelligence activities. For instance, later on, the ship that
                    raised the Soviet submarine, the Glomar Explorer.</p>
                <p>I was there at the first meeting after it was plain that the electoral process
                    was going to put Allende in power. Kissinger in effect said, “Just because they
                    voted to go communist do you think we ought to standby and let it happened?”
                    After that I was never a backbencher, we were thrown out. Later, Alex Johnson
                    sent us down a series of minutes and we thought we were back in the picture, but
                    actually there was a third layer where Kissinger went directly to CIA and had a
                    whole series of additional activities planned to influence the situation. I
                    don't think even Alex knew about that at the time. These were the activities
                    investigated [by Congress] in the Church-Pike hearings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was also a Henry Kissinger who enjoyed doing this and
                        was heavily supported by the President, Richard Nixon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Kissinger, I think, got a real kick out of doing it that way and I think
                    Nixon probably did, too. I am not too sure CIA liked the assignment which they
                    thought would not succeed. Normally they enjoy a direct assignment from the
                    White House. With regards to Kissinger's interest in covert angles I have always
                    regretted one lost chance. Jim Gardner (Rhodes scholar) who was in INR/DDC had
                    reached the conclusion that Allende was likely to win. He did not think that a
                    program to assist the right wing candidate would achieve any results in Chile.
                    Tomic was a candidate considerably to the left of Allende but with little public
                    following. Jim in a paper proposed that we aid and assist his campaign without
                    his knowing it in the hope that he would draw enough votes from Allende to let
                    Alexandre again be voted in. I sent the memo to CIA for comment but got none and
                    Jim discussed it with the policy bureau which asked us not to give it
                    dissemination outside State; I therefore held off sending it to the NSC staff.
                    In his post-mortem during a Forty Committee meeting Kissinger concluded that we
                    should have aided Tomic, for, if he had gotten a little over thirty thousand
                    more votes, Allende would have been denied the election.</p>
                <p>The most recent controversial activity was the Iran Contra operatiowhich was run
                    around INR, but not the Department of State.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes. The ARA [Bureau of Interamerican Affairs] assistant secretary was
                    thoroughly involved but INR was not. By a directive from the Secretary of State,
                    the assistant secretary of INR is charged with keeping the Secretary advised of
                    covert operations. An officer in INR/DDC drafted a memo saying, “Mr. Secretary I
                    can't keep you informed because I have not been kept informed.” Mort Abramowitz,
                    the very able assistant secretary, was about to send it forward when some of the
                    staff people said, “Mort you are griping against another assistant secretary,
                    don't do it.” I think Mort probably regretted later that he hadn't sent the memo
                    forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about this a bit. You say INR is not informed
                        ocertain clandestine things, what is the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: On covert operations, it has occasionally been the case [that] higher
                    authority decides [it is] not going to keep State thoroughly informed. Kissinger
                    talked to CIA on Chile and said to do it this way. And, I think the same thing
                    happened on the Contra with Casey who was a real cowboy on things like this and
                    loved it. ARA was involved. All the directives say INR should be kept advised
                    and I think mostly we are.</p>
                <p>Q: We have been going back and forth between the sixties and seventies, but
                    essentially you were on this Committee for Clandestine Operations as sort of a
                    watchdog? We talked about the Cuban missile crisis. Where else did you move?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: The committee on clandestine intelligence handled requirements - not
                    operations. You were mentioning the problem of an embassy having a large staff
                    including many CIA people without a lot of knowledge of who was doing what. In
                    terms of what to do, I think basically there is no easy answer. Take a look at
                    the collection imperatives, based on requests that the CIA and the intelligence
                    community are responding to. Before I had anything to do with the question of
                    clandestine collection I remember an exchange between senior people at State and
                    CIA. A State officer at a post said that State will do the political and
                    economic collection and CIA responded at a high level that their charter
                    authorized them to collect in any field, political, economic, whatever, where
                    they felt there might be sources that would be profitable. The intensity of
                    their response showed how strongly they felt about this. I think they were
                    right.</p>
                <p>You asked about clandestine collection. I was on a clandestine collection
                    committee handling requirements. The problems are that the requirements are
                    inclusive. Dean Rusk, when he was secretary, sent down word to us that he wanted
                    us to bring up to him all of the requirements levied on a military attach�. We
                    said to our front office, “Do you mind if we take them up in a wheelbarrow?”
                    They are voluminous since the intelligence community feels that it has literally
                    a requirement to know almost everything. I never forget a mid-level analyst in
                    some meeting saying, “Not even God Almighty can stand between an intelligence
                    officer and fulfillment of a valid requirement.”</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>One experience I had in this field was quite interesting. A telegram came in from
                    Admiral Felt who was CINCPAC [Commander-in-Chief, Pacific] saying he understood
                    that the Soviets were placing SAMs, surface to air missiles, in Indonesia. His
                    telegram concluded with the words, “If they succeed in doing this, my position
                    in the Pacific will be out flanked.” The reconnaissance committee was
                    immediately called in and the recommendation was that we have a U-2 overflight
                    over Indonesia. Well, State played its usual dog-in-a-manger role. I was the
                    representative. We did not want the U-2 over Indonesia because at that point
                    Sukarno was having real political difficulties. At that time the Soviets had
                    ships in the area that could detect the U-2, we knew that. We didn't want to
                    give them any excuse to go to Sukarno and buck him up and strengthen his
                    position by revealing what we were doing. Besides, we said that there were lots
                    of other ways to get the information. The SAMs were suppose to be at a military
                    base which our planes fly by and with side looking photography we could detect
                    them. Our military attach�s had access to much of the base. Our position was
                    that, if we can't get it any other way, then use the U-2 as a last resort, but
                    let's try these other ways.</p>
                <p>The subcommittee that I was on validated the requirements for an overflight with
                    a dissent from State. It went on up to the United States Intelligence Board
                    where the director of INR sat. I briefed him, but the board validated the
                    requirement and sent it on up to the Forty Committee. In so doing they passed a
                    guideline that I think is just exactly the reverse of how things should be done.
                    They said that analysts down in the woodwork, they did not mention me, should
                    consider only the intelligence requirement and not the political costs.
                    Political costs should be evaluated only later at the high level. This means the
                    whole weight of the community gets behind a requirement and one man at the top
                    is supposed to say “no.” I believactivities [that will be politically sensitive]
                    should not normally be the first resort.</p>
                <p>It went to the Forty Committee. We briefed Alex Johnson and Alex as usual was
                    very responsive. He said to the committee, “Well, I understand your interest but
                    we have these objections.” At the committee was Cyrus Vance, who was Deputy
                    Secretary of Defense who was going out to see [Admiral] Felt [in Honolulu]. When
                    he came back he said, “I asked Admiral Felt about this and Felt said somebody on
                    his staff drafted the telegram and it didn't matter.” The flight was dropped.
                    But, this illustrates how the system works. The woods are full of requirements
                    that people say must be met or the republic will be in jeopardy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give a little bit of the framework of the
                        committeeyou have served on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>McAFEE: I served on a whole lot over a period of years. I served on the Defector
                    Committee, which could be quite interesting. One example of very close State-CIA
                    relations came on that. The Damascus embassy sent a telegram reporting that a
                    Chinese Communist diplomat had walked into the embassy at lunch time and the
                    embassy wanted to know what the guidelines were. Although NEA and EA had
                    concerns over problems with the Chinese Communists and with Syria the agreed
                    view was, “Look, here is a man who has put his life into our hands by coming
                    over. We have to take him.” It was put into the hands of DDO [Deputy Director of
                    Operations] and the station chief to manage, with coordination with the COM.</p>
                <p>Q: DDO?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: CIA's clandestine covert action part. I kept in touch with Tom
                    Karamassines, who was the head of DDO. They carried Chinese food in for him,
                    etc. on a very regular basis. One morning Tom called me, (I never asked Tom what
                    they were going to do in terms of getting him out.) and said that he would let
                    me know by noon how it went. At noon he called me and said he was out. They
                    continued carrying Chinese food in for a few more days and then trailed it off.
                    It just got accepted. I think it was handled very well by the Agency and the
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>The most spectacular defector case was, I think, the Hungarian ambassador here.
                    Dean Rusk handled it personally. It was the most overt defection in history. The
                    FBI and all sorts of other armed people moved a truck up and cleaned out his
                    house and his vault, at his request.</p>
                <p>Several defector cases got a lot of national attention. Colonel Golynsky of the
                    KGB defected with a lot of highly valuable information. CIA had good records on
                    him, his place of birth, etc. The Agency told us at one point that he was
                    deteriorating and about this time the Brooklyn Eagle reported that this valuable
                    defector, who was the heir to the Romanov throne, was living in squalor in
                    Brooklyn. Actually CIA had provided for him well and permanently. His false
                    claim to be a Romanov spread rapidly and State eventually responded to hundreds
                    of letters [alleging] such mistreatment.</p>
                <p>The other case involved Nosenko who came over not long after Kennedy's
                    assassination, saying among other things that the USSR was not behind Oswald.
                    CIA was split on the issue of his credentials and he was kept in isolation for a
                    long time.</p>
                <p>It was a good committee and we worked fairly closely together. Normally there
                    weren't a great many problems. Our problems were a little the reverse. A person
                    in State called me once about a fairly senior Cuban, and said, “Bill, we have a
                    defector here.” I called the Agency and they said, “Is his name Fidel?” I said,
                    “No.” And they said that they were not interested. CIA was inundated with such
                    requests. These people could be granted asylum which involved much less USG
                    action. We worked very well together on defectors. The clandestine intelligence
                    committee was less effective, being more of a paper trail.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>One program which Dennis Kux, then deputy assistant secretary for coordination,
                    pushed was countering Soviet active measures. The Soviets for instance would
                    release in Europe what they identified as a U.S. government telegram on U.S.
                    stationery to missions in Europe saying in effect that in case of a nuclear
                    exchange the U.S. would sacrifice western Europe to save its own skin. These
                    forgeries had a receptive audience and Dennis and CIA associates sought means to
                    reveal the fraud and set the record straight. On the question of a major
                    national program to deceive the Soviets about our true intentions I was involved
                    in a one-time meeting. I took the position that though misinformation in war was
                    often essential our best approach in peace time was to rely on a straight
                    forward explanation of our policies. The military took a similar position. Jim
                    Angleton of CIA, who believed the U.S. had been totally duped by U.S.S.R.
                    misinformation, favored an active U.S. program but as far as I know the issue of
                    a majornational program died then and there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you deal with deception, you have a right hand - left
                        hanproblem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Very much so. It was at this meeting that an example of individual agency
                    initiatives in deception surfaced. A representative referred to a program they
                    and the military had run. The military had conducted some tests in a field
                    involving what we now refer to as weapons of mass destruction and found their
                    approach unproductive. The two agencies decided to feed to Soviet agents
                    continuing reports on the progress of the program even though the U.S. had
                    discontinued it, eventually figuring that the Soviets spent a large sum in
                    trying to duplicate our program. Later investigation showed that U.S.
                    intelligence agencies, unaware of the deception program, had followed the Soviet
                    developments with much interest and concern. At that point the follow-up was
                    turned over to a very able officer in INR's politico-military branch.</p>
                <p>Deception can obviously work both ways. When I was in SEAC, the grapevine had it
                    that a highly sophisticated signals deception effort against the Japanese had
                    equally deceived the British planners. Every major intelligence service has
                    agents through which it can feed information to other countries. The most
                    effective use of such channels that I had anything to do with came during the
                    Berlin crisis after Khrushchev had figured he could handle Kennedy. The USG
                    decided to put out word through all available means that we were going to hang
                    tough in Europe. A considerable number of military units were activated or
                    moved. Word of these movements was passed through these controlled sources and
                    in four or five weeks the Soviets saw that the reports were true as units moved.
                    The whole thrust in this case was not to deceive but to stress real U.S.
                    intentions. Given the nature of intelligence such activities must be on going
                    today. In wartime they are of especial importance. Churchill coined the phrase
                    “In wartime, truth is so precious that she must be surrounded by a bodyguard of
                    lies.” Allied deception about a second landing persuaded Hitler to hold back his
                    reserves and greatly helped the Normandy landings. Some military writers claimed
                    that we did not effectively use deception later in the war.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Anything that is not normally available through overt collection, through
                    the Foreign Service, liaison, attach�s or other open sources. It means in
                    essence a secret, and frequently illegal procedure where you are subverting a
                    foreign national, illegally getting classified materials, listening to
                    communications or anything of that nature. Overt collection may involve highly
                    sensitive information but its method of collection is open; clandestine
                    collection involves secret procedures. We had what we called a Priorities
                    Committee, which was supposed to define the priorities for clandestine
                    collection. Despite whatever we did there were still so many priorities that an
                    overseas staff could be kept busy for the rest of the century.</p>
                <p>There was a Critical Collection Problem Committee which didn't last very long; it
                    was set up to look at very specific problems as determined by USIB. At one point
                    I think we were charged with Soviet missilery and we could draw all across the
                    community on all sources on what the Soviets might be doing. There were, of
                    course, all sorts of questions re China and the Middle East. The thought was
                    that all information of all kinds should be available to a small group in
                    Washington. That was an interesting committee, but short lived. It was staffed
                    with generalists and each task required highly specialized knowledge.</p>
                <p>The Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance was one of my most interesting
                    assignments. It coordinated targets for the U-2 and the SR-71 and DOD photo
                    satellites. I got heavily involved in this committee after the Powers incident
                    in 1960. Over the years a number of lives were lost during reconnaissance
                    activities. Bruce Catton in one of his great books on the Civil War noted a
                    campaign where opposing armies were moving parallel, and he wrote that a
                    balloonist high above the lines at night might see a rim of fire when patrols
                    met at unnamed crossroads. I often thought of our reconnaissance programs in
                    this light and hoped that State in working closely with DOD could keep the rim
                    of fire to a minimum. Let me note an episode of a different nature. Most of our
                    air reconnaissance programs directed against China during the Cold War stayed
                    well away from their territorial limit - something like thirty miles out but
                    they became the object of increasing harassment by Chicom fighters until this
                    reached the point that the DOD felt the U.S. planes were being seriously
                    jeopardized. These were large, slow flying planes with a dozen or more intercept
                    operators on board in addition to the crew. At one point the JRC told us that
                    within the U.S. rules of engagement they felt obligated to take steps to protect
                    the flights. They said they planned to put a fighter high above the
                    reconnaissance vehicle and if it were unduly harassed to take appropriate
                    action, if necessary shooting down the Chicom fighter. We told State's senior
                    level of the plan and informed the DOD that their plan had been noted. After
                    [an] incident such [Chinese] activity ceased, and there was no protest.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>It was curious sometimes the things you found out. We were sensitive in the
                    Mediterranean about how close our nationally controlled flights should be going
                    to Libya. The military always wanted to go a little bit closer. We thought 18
                    miles was a reasonable distance. The military said that line of sight counts and
                    at four miles [closer] you collect signals from four miles farther back. After
                    some head-knockings we got the 18 mile limit. Then, somebody later found out
                    that the Sixth Fleet had routinely authorized people to go in four miles closer
                    and had been doing that all along. So, you think, “Well, that was a battle that
                    really wasn't worth it.”</p>
                <p>We had a long battle with the Pentagon about ship reconnaissance off of Shanghai.
                    The Chinese Communists were very, very sensitive. If we put a junk up there,
                    they would harass it and our planes, which stayed well away from their shores
                    were harassed. At one point, Admiral Moorer, who was always hardline, wanted to
                    go in to 13 miles off Shanghai. State stood it off and it ended up at 18. But,
                    the Pentagon was quite unhappy about that. We believed that the extra
                    intelligence gained by a closer approach did not justify the risk of a major
                    incident.</p>
                <p>The two greatest incidents were the USS Pueblo and the USS Liberty. A ship
                    similar to the Pueblo had gone up through the area a year before without
                    incident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about a very small, electronic collecting
                        navaship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Exactly. We were quite aware that it was going to be a sensitive mission
                    and our representative at the Joint Reconnaissance Center came back and
                    highlighted it. We drafted a memo pointing out its sensitivity. When we cleared
                    it in EA we took it to Sam Burger, deputy assistant secretary, and he looked at
                    it and agreed that it was sensitive but agreed it had been cleared appropriately
                    through various channels. The deputy under secretary for political affairs was
                    briefed and approved. We provided our vote directly to the Pentagon rather than
                    through the NSC staff. That staff followed reconnaissance closely and frequently
                    consulted State on political risks but we did not initiate any assessment
                    discussion with them. Actually the Pentagon in top secret [congressional]
                    hearings was very straight and direct. [It testified], “We got a very clear,
                    unambiguous warning from the Department that this was going to be a highly
                    sensitive and risky activity.” The NSA did something interesting. They approved
                    the operation and then the day after that they said it was going to be
                    sensitive. A little bit of “we are macho, but you have to be careful.”</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>I remember when word came in that the Pueblo had been seized and the next months
                    we spent trying to figure out how to get the people out and post morteming all
                    aspects of the operation. It was an extremely worrisome time - most of all I am
                    sure for the crew. The curious end of the episode, and it has been written up,
                    was achieved by Jim Leonard, who was in INR on the research side. He proposed a
                    simple formula. The Koreans were demanding an apology for intrusion. Actually we
                    had not intruded. He said, “Let's apologize for intruding and then say that was
                    a flat lie, we did not intrude.” Our general at the table said we apologize for
                    intruding but, of course, this is a lie because we didn't intrude. That ended
                    the crisis. It is a strange world.</p>
                <p>Q: When you were plotting this electronic ship going in which was essentially
                    unarmed and very slow and was picked up by North Korean surface ships, was there
                    an automatic backup? In other words, if they get into trouble how far away is
                    our support?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: It depended for its security on the legality of the operation. That
                    became a major criticism of the operation. To provide close military support for
                    reconnaissance vehicles would change the collection environment. There was no
                    surface backup close and air backup was a sizable time distance away. The Pueblo
                    had some small arms. If it had used them and tried to flee and held off for half
                    an hour or so air support probably would have been there, but there might have
                    been a lot more people killed on the Pueblo than there were. There was just one
                    [such incident] but one too many. It was a powerfully unhappy time.</p>
                <p>Q: Did that cause an awful lot of soul searching and was there a palpable change
                    on how we looked on things on your committee after that?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: These activities were cleared by the Forty Committee principals in each
                    Agency and there was an extensive review, especially in DOD. We had always felt
                    that North Korea and Libya were two totally unpredictable nations and that
                    anything we did had to be done with great care. For instance, in the later
                    overflights of North Korea we used the SR-71, which they couldn't do anything
                    about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the high flying blackbird?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes. The U-2 flew up to 70,000 feet and the SR-71 another 10-20,000 feet
                    above that. It was so fast [anti-aircraft] missiles couldn't catch it. We were
                    very much concerned about the situation and suspended any ship reconnaissance
                    off North Korea. There was criticism of the intelligence community for not
                    having given the Pueblo an alert because the day before it was seized a North
                    Korean assassination squad had approached the Blue House, the president's house
                    in Seoul, and had actually gotten fairly close before a firefight stopped
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were out to assassinate Park Chung Hee, the president
                        oSouth Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Exactly. The community was faulted for not, after that, giving the Pueblo
                    some kind of alert to pull out. Tension in the area was high. We tried to keep
                    an ongoing assessment of risks to sensitive operations but no agency picked up
                    on that indicator. Looking back it seems impossible to understand.
                    Compartmentalization was part of the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about going back to a different period, this was in
                        thseventies. When was the Pueblo again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: The Pueblo was in early 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then a little before that there was a 1967 incident
                        witthe Liberty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes, that is right, in June 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was essentially the same type of ship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: It was a much bigger ship. The Liberty was a converted [World War II]
                    liberty ship. Its mission, as sent over from the Pentagon, called for electronic
                    reconnaissance off the west coast of Africa. It would be staying off 20 or so
                    miles and picking up what signals it could. The Pentagon sent a very clear
                    chart. They were as usual well organized concerning the ship's mission - where
                    it would go and how close and everything. It was a routine operation and this
                    was approved without dissent.</p>
                <p>One morning I got a call on the secure phone. When I answered it, the director of
                    the JRC was on the line and he said, “Bill, the Liberty is under attack off
                    Alexandria.” I asked who the attacker was. He said, “Well, we don't know that
                    either.” The secretary's staff meeting was going on, Tom Hughes, INR's director,
                    attending. I hurried up and asked a staffer to get him to come out and he said
                    for me to go in. I told Tom and the meeting broke up immediately. Then the
                    question was what happened? How did the Liberty get in there? The Pentagon the
                    week before had sent out a brief memo saying, “Re the Liberty delete West Africa
                    and substitute Eastern Mediterranean.” We had a good man at the JRC but he
                    missed the significance of the change and only entered the change into the
                    monthly reconnaissance schedule. It was handled the same way in all other
                    agencies. Not a single principal, like the director of INR was briefed. That
                    memo, the way they crossed out Africa and put in Mediterranean, caught no ones
                    attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like somebody knew bureaucratic ways and was
                        slippinthis under the door.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>McAFEE: I don't think that was the intent at all, but it was a very costly
                    bureaucratic slip-up. Of course, a directive came from high immediately saying
                    any significant change in an approved program should come by memo to all
                    holders. There was a crisis in the Middle East and the Pentagon felt they had
                    better get the Liberty there. It was to go no closer than 16 miles off
                    Alexandria. The night before the Liberty came under attack the JRC realizing its
                    position off Egypt sent out a message telling it to move out and abide by Sixth
                    Fleet normal restrictions, which I think at that point because of the tensions
                    were set at fifty miles. That is the message that the Liberty did not pick up,
                    the Sixth Fleet did not pick up. It was this strange and tragic development that
                    produced a cartoon in the New Yorker showing two people on a desert island
                    fishing a bottle out of the water and saying it is a message from the Joint
                    Chiefs to the Liberty. The Liberty to this day remains a highly controversial
                    incident because its U.S. flag was flying bright and clear on it. The U.S.
                    military said it was incomprehensible that the attacking Israelis didn't
                    recognize it as such. They, of course, contended they did not. The military
                    always felt very strongly that during repeated attacks, its identity could not
                    have been missed.</p>
                <p>Q: You still find a very strong group who still use this in a way to attack the
                    Israelis, arguing that it was a continuous attack, it was not a one shot and the
                    Israelis knew what they were doing. In a way it is incomprehensible. It served
                    them no military purpose to do it to our ship.</p>
                <p>McAFEE: The only reason that has been put forth is that they were getting ready
                    for operations against Syria, and they knew the Liberty had the capability of
                    intercepting what would be their extensive military command net and that we
                    might object to the operation. Therefore they blocked us out. It is hard to
                    conceive of this being their motive, but it is very hard to understand how they
                    could attack it without knowing it was an American ship. We lost 34 Americans
                    killed and many more were wounded.</p>
                <p>Q: This thing at first had tremendous political repercussions because Israel has
                    a very strong support from the American Jewish community, and others, which is
                    the most politically effective lobbying group in the United States of this era.
                    Here was something as bad as it could be. Attacking an American naval vessel for
                    maybe a short term gain. You are on the committee dealing with this problem.
                    Were you put on more constraints than you would have if this had been an attack
                    by the Algerians, etc.?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: Not that I know of. As I said the Pentagon was told always to spell out
                    any major change. Normally we did not send that kind of a ship into the
                    Mediterranean. We had other ships that operated in there, but I don't think they
                    operated that close in. I agree, it was a very upsetting incident and with any
                    other country it would have become much more devastating than it was, but
                    because of the Israeli support here, it ended more quickly. The Israelis
                    eventually paid over $12 million in reparations. It immediately ceased to be an
                    intelligence problem and became a policy problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Q: You put a young CIA officer out somewhere and tell him to go out and develop
                    contacts. All of us who have been in any business know this isn't the easiest
                    thing and when you do it you often run afoul of a political officer who is
                    meeting him and you are paying off. We have already discussed this but I was
                    wondering about whether you had the feeling that there was almost a quota and
                    tremendous pressure on CIA officers to go out and develop people? This could
                    cause a real problem.</p>
                <p>McAFEE: One illustration, and I can't quote this from having seen any directive,
                    but people in the Agency told me about it, involved Ted Shackley. I liked Ted.
                    When we worked together he was responsive. He was a real gung-ho operator as the
                    deputy in DDO. I understand that he graded station chiefs among other things on
                    the number of recruitment's by their station per month. This presents the exact
                    problem that you raised. In other words, go out and get somebody, anybody. Among
                    other things you are not likely to get highly reliable sources and you can be
                    sure if somebody is selling out that easily to you he is probably selling out to
                    the British, Russians and everybody else on the block. Yes, I think there is
                    much too much of that. We may gain some sources but there is a residual
                    cost.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: No, we looked only at the requirements. We had nothing to do with actual
                    operations or how aggressive CIA should be. CIA enjoys great support from the
                    NSC and the President and the Hill. It spends a lot of effort cultivating these
                    contacts. No president wants to cut back CIA and then get caught short on
                    intelligence in a crisis and be told you sold us down the river. When we were
                    being cut and pared back, the CIA was building up. It is simply a fact of life
                    that State is almost always in the dog house and CIA normally is being asked by
                    Congress what more do you need and the White House is giving them encouragement.
                    During the Cold War, they were regarded as a hard line first defense. It results
                    in this imbalance in staffing. However, a good CIA station chief who will target
                    his sources and get good sources can make a highly valuable contribution,
                    particularly in closed or hostile societies, the countries we are most concerned
                    about.</p>
                <p>I don't know whether you ever talked to Martin Packman. He was the deputy
                    assistant secretary in INR for [research] who prepared the morning briefing for
                    the Secretary. I remember somebody talking to him and saying he would like to
                    kill off a lot of the clandestine collecting. He thought there were too many
                    people involved. Martin said, “Yes, but I would hate to prepare the morning
                    summary without the substance we get from CIA sources.” Martin made the summary
                    first rate.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>On the other hand, what we have is literally an overt clandestine service. I
                    visited Latin America and I asked to talk not only with the station chiefs but
                    people down the line and CIA agreed. Down in one of the Latin American countries
                    a junior CIA officer in the consular section liked his assignment and liked
                    State. He said, “If he were an outsider permitted access to the embassy, within
                    24-48 hours he could tell who was CIA. If we didn't let him in, within a week or
                    two weeks sitting across the street he could tell who was CIA. That they
                    operated that openly.”</p>
                <p>How to keep it within reasonable limits? On staffing I am a pessimist - on
                    operations less so. We count on the chief of mission to coordinate all
                    activities of his mission including those of the station giving him a pretty
                    full plate from everything he is doing. Basically, I think, from looking at the
                    record over the years, the places where State and CIA were happiest with each
                    other were places where the ambassador was an activist, kept in close touch with
                    a strong station chief and made certain that he was kept informed. A strong
                    ambassador and strong section chief is probably the best answer to the problem.
                    A strong COM can make it clear he wants to be kept informed and can judge
                    political risks and a strong station chief can make on the spot decisions.</p>
                <p>Another valuable arm is the periodic inspection under the Inspector General. The
                    inspectors come around and talk to INR before they go out and we go over
                    problems, concerns on staffing, cover, collection activities, relations with the
                    embassy. Their reports were excellent. One that just knocked my eye out was by
                    Bill Knight. Do you know him?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, I know Bill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: I forget where he was, but, the Agency was a little bit unhappy with
                    Bill. He sat down and asked each of their men what their collection priorities
                    were, who established them, what they planned to do to fulfill them, what they
                    were collecting that could be collected overtly. He didn't try to find out who
                    their sources were but he did check on whether they were overworking local
                    circuits. He had an exceptionally thorough review. He checked on coordination
                    with the ambassador and embassy officers on the embassy's total collection
                    program and on coordination with the ambassador on particularly sensitive
                    activities. We asked the Office of the Inspector General [OIG] to bring that
                    review to the attention of his inspectors as an outstanding example of how
                    effective OIG could be. Most inspectors are not going to press quite that hard,
                    and some ambassadors won't take the time required to keep in close touch with
                    the station chief, and some station chiefs don't like that detailed a
                    review.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Back here in Washington, the best coordination vehicle that I was involved in was
                    with the political bureaus, where the assistant secretary or his line deputy, a
                    representative of INR, and the DDO chief for the area met weekly. I mentioned
                    Ted Shackley a few minutes ago. Ted was in DDO when Phil Habib was the assistant
                    secretary for East Asian affairs. Art Hummel who was Phil's deputy knew about
                    these meetings because he had seen how effective they were in NEA. He said,
                    “Bill, let's set one up,” which we did. It was a good meeting, Art had people
                    come in for just one item for detailed background. Phil asked “What is this man
                    here for? What are we doing this for?” When it was all over Art looked at me
                    knowing Phil wasn't going to sit still for this procedure.</p>
                <p>After Phil became the under secretary for political affairs, by which time he had
                    had another heart attack, I got called up to his office and he was lying on a
                    couch in one of the back rooms. He sat up and said, “Bill, you know how I
                    coordinated EA relations with CIA?” I said, “Sure do.” He said, “I did it all on
                    the secure phone direct with Ted Shackley.” Then he looked at me and said, “I
                    now hold you personally responsible for assuring that no assistant secretary
                    handles it that way at this time.” He then laughed and I did too, because he now
                    recognized that the weekly meetings were a good mechanism. That is the best
                    inside State mechanism. With a tightly controlled meeting, an agreed agenda and
                    the assistant secretary or his deputy and the area DDOand one INR
                    representative, people came prepared for a frank discussion. That was a good
                    forum.</p>
                <p>Because they were considered secure all source type meetings discussions were
                    often wide ranging considering perhaps a specific covert operation - its status,
                    prospects and concerns by all parties including DDO. State at times used that
                    forum to ask DDO to develop specific covert operations. Clandestine collection
                    was discussed with emphasis on concerns of various missions. Sometimes in the
                    field the COS could say a collection requirement was levied by Washington but we
                    were in Washington and could assess the validity of such requirements from the
                    Washington angle more thoroughly than the field could. State often used the
                    meetings to ask for a priority collection effort against specific targets in
                    light of upcoming policy decisions. CIA used the meetings to express any
                    concerns over the way things were going overseas and to suggest adjustments.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the things I had a little experience in was when I was consul general
                    in Greece and the Colonels were in control, 1970-74. I would be getting
                    information from people who would walk in. The consular section has a lot of
                    people coming in and out and you get a pretty good feel for things. I reported
                    about tortures and nasty things that the military was doing. Almost invariably I
                    would be shot down because the CIA station chief would say, “Well, we have our
                    own sources and everything is fine.” Well, th“sources” were the guys who were
                    beating up and being nasty. If you say you have some secret information that
                    sounds better than overt.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>McAFEE: That is a good example of policy (in this case a CIA operation)
                    influencing intelligence. CIA worked closely with the colonels. I agree with you
                    totally [that there is an unhealthy tendency to believe] secretly collected
                    intelligence. During the Russian buildup in Cuba, before we knew what they were
                    up to, although we knew there were a lot of people going in, a Latin American
                    ambassador in Cuba, who was respected, sent a report to his home office saying
                    that the Soviets had sent in too many administrative and industrial technicians
                    and they were now being sent back to Russia. This report came into our hands. It
                    was believed widely because it was obtained secretly and it was 100 percent
                    wrong. On Greece I think as you say, State and the Agency were on opposite
                    wavelengths.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the time of the Colonels.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: And even before, when the Agency thought it might be appropriate to have
                    some covert activity in support of a right wing party and the Department opposed
                    it. INR opposed it actually. NEA was for it. We in INR took the position that
                    the Agency, to be effective, would be using people that the opposition knew
                    about and were watching. Secondly, we said, “Someday you are going to have to
                    live with the situation. We can't impose a right-wing type government on Greece
                    forever. We don't think they want to be communists and part of the Soviet bloc
                    and it would be better to live with the situation.” That decision, about half a
                    dozen years before you went there, went up to Foy Kohler and he backed INR
                    against the bureau. The bureau appealed to the Secretary and he backed us. But,
                    I don't think that precluded CIA's interest in working covertly with the
                    military. I feel CIA and the Greek military were working very closely together
                    and they did not want reports such as you proposed coming out because they might
                    disturb that liaison.</p>
                <p>I was in Athens in 1974 and met with all levels of the embassy. The FSOs did not
                    have confidence that the COS was leveling with them on internal developments.
                    You can take such charges with a grain of salt in view of long term differences
                    of approach and orientation, but I was struck with the universality with which
                    this view was held. The military attach�s then asked me to meet with them as a
                    group late in the day. They provided me the same view only more strongly stated.
                    They said the latest colonels' revolt had started at around 3:00 AM at a
                    military base there and that when the embassy got word of it at about 7:00 AM
                    they called the COS who professed ignorance. This they found hard to believe
                    since the CIA station had informants on the base. Theirconclusions were that the
                    coup had taken place with CIA consent. I went up to visit with the COS but it
                    was late in the day on a Friday evening and business had been suspended. I
                    checked and found the COM was leaving town early the next day as was I so I made
                    no further report to Athens. On return to D.C. I raised the question with NEA
                    and DDO, which said the COS was due back in a few weeks and suggested we await
                    his return. Before he came back the colonels had been overthrown - he was kept
                    in place and the meeting never took place. I do think that in a few places at
                    certain times there has been a segment of the station that works at cross
                    purposes with the embassy as a whole.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Did you get involved in the whole Vietnam
                        business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Very little. The Agency was used in Vietnam very heavily. It was
                    literally used as an overt arm because of its great capability in supplying
                    arms, training, intelligence equipment, etc. When you get into a war you do
                    things anyway you want to.</p>
                <p>One of the places we got heavily involved was with the USS Maddox ithe Tonkin
                    Gulf incident.</p>
                <p>Q: This was when the North Vietnamese torpedo ships attacked or didn't attack, it
                    is still not clear, the Maddox and then the Turner Joy, two U.S. destroyers.</p>
                <p>McAFEE: That's right. The Maddox was sent in first on a mission that was cleared
                    by all agencies. We later learned that a day or so before the incident there had
                    been a raid by ships under CIA or military control against a communist outpost.
                    Most of the people who approved the Maddox mission did not know about the other
                    activity; down on the working level there was no info on it, the activity was
                    separately compartmented. Whether knowledge of it would have changed our views
                    is a question for Monday morning quarterbacks. The North Vietnamese at least
                    [sortied] against the Maddox. To this day I do not know if they fired anything
                    or not. There was a meeting in Vietnam sometime ago with some U.S. generals
                    going out and they met with the top North Vietnamese command. The question was
                    asked if they had fired at any time and they said, “No.” On the other hand, that
                    doesn't mean they didn't, because it is in the light of history in their
                    interest to claim to be innocent.</p>
                <p>Then the Turner Joy was put in and our representative at the Reconnaissance
                    Center called me and said, “Bill, Turner Joy is under attack.” He said that
                    there had been 15 or so torpedoes and more were coming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a lot of torpedoes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: It certainly is. Then he said, “Hold the line.” He came back and said,
                    “The Pentagon people think that the destroyers are reading the sound of their
                    own wake. So, forget this information all together.” What happened is still
                    being argued over. Whatever the case, Lyndon Johnson used the incident to get
                    the congressional resolution to literally fight the war.</p>
                <p>Q: On the Maddox incident, in a way the irony of so many things of
                    compartmentalization is, that a raid is conducted against the North Vietnamese
                    coast. Now, as far as the North Vietnamese are concerned, this is not a secret
                    matter. They know somebody has come and raided them. So, the fact that it
                    happened was certainly known to the enemy, but our own forces that were involved
                    in it didn't. We divide it off and don't tell people.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>McAFEE: Shooting ourselves in the foot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This happens again and again where often the only people
                        who don't know are either the American public or maybe those who ought to
                        know, because the enemy knows when something like that happens and our
                        people who did it know that it happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: And it is hard to believe when we raid one day and send in a ship the
                    next day that the enemy won't consider the two actions a provocation that merits
                    some kind of response. I agree. Charges have been made that those planning the
                    two activities wanted an incident to justify escalation. I think it was more
                    likely that the right hand did not know what the left was doing. There is no
                    easy answer in balancing security and need to know.</p>
                <p>Q: What about efforts around the Soviet Union? There used to be something called
                    Yoke flights and there were very electronic ships and air flights going in
                    testing the radar and all. This was a fairly major effort on both our side and
                    on the Soviet side. They were trying to shoot us down if we came in too far.
                    Were you involved in this?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes, for the most part after it had been long underway when our office
                    was told to handled coordination of the monthly reconnaissance schedule. I got
                    involved with reconnaissance initially when I was special assistant to Park
                    Armstrong and Hugh Cumming on individual missions or programs. The Pentagon
                    would come over to see us and discuss the mission being planned. One of the very
                    first that I remember was when it was decided to put 200-300 photo balloons over
                    the Soviet Union, hoping to find secret military facilities. They were flown
                    from Scotland. The Pentagon prediction was that they would fly over the Soviet
                    Union and be picked up in the Pacific. I don't know what went wrong, both
                    technically and in terms of planning, because a lot of them came down or were
                    shot down in the western part of Russia, and the Russians with great glee showed
                    the Norwegians pictures of their defense installations taken by the Americans.
                    That was Program Genetrix and it was a disaster.</p>
                <p>Then, eight or nine months later, a major came over and said, “We want a very
                    much reduced program and this will be over southern Russia. They will be
                    launched in the Pacific and will go westward. They are much higher flying
                    balloons and will not drop down as far at night when it gets cooler and thus be
                    vulnerable to being shot down like the other ones.” They said that they were
                    looking for secret nuclear installations. The proposal went all the way up to
                    secretary Dulles, who approved six flights and they were launched.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Later, the major came over to talk to me and he said, “Several of the balloons
                    are approaching [I think it was the Kiev area, I am not sure] and are slowly
                    descending. They have moved much slower than we thought and without our
                    knowledge or consultation with us, the people who were to collect them in the
                    Atlantic had worked with the production people and put a cutoff date on because
                    otherwise they might just fly across the Atlantic too high for us to get.” He
                    said, “They are now coming down [to ground] and we have communications
                    intelligence that indicates the Russians are checking them.” We waited for the
                    next protest, which never came. As far as I know there never was a peep. I think
                    the answer is there were only five or six and they were waiting for the rest of
                    the 200 and they never came. The major, who was the operations officer for the
                    project, got reprimanded and transferred for the failure of the program. He said
                    he was not aware of the fact that there was a cutoff. The Pentagon does things
                    very, very well in many cases, but in this case one hand didn't tell the other.
                    We liked and respected the major. I think it was after this that the DOD set up
                    the Joint Reconnaissance Center to coordinate all such programs.</p>
                <p>From our standpoint, the Joint Reconnaissance Center (JRC) made life much easier.
                    All DOD recce programs came under it including the type you mentioned against
                    the U.S.S.R. and were included in a monthly book of projected flights which came
                    to us and other Forty Committee agencies for advance clearance. There were
                    charts showing closest points of approach, number of missions planned and types
                    of missions. We had a young FSO assigned as our representative at the JRC to
                    handle the multitude of programs and changes and ad hoc additions. It was a good
                    investment. He had access at the bureau level all across State and drafted the
                    memos that went to the under secretary for political affairs for final
                    clearance. At one point, State and DIA thought that certain flights were
                    repetitive (unnecessarily so) and took the matter up with the JRC - which
                    eventually cut 300 flights a month. The major incidents like the shooting down
                    of the Little Toy Dog - a reconnaissance flight off the U.S.S.R. - came before
                    the JRC was set up. The JRC could push for close approaches but it provided a
                    good [open] forum for their consideration.</p>
                <p>The JRC had great worldwide communications. One day a bureau officer at a high
                    level called me and mentioned a specific flight which we had cleared with him.
                    He believed certain developments made it necessary for him to withdraw his
                    clearance. It was the day for the flight. I called the JRC and the officer who
                    answered said “stand by one.” When he came back on he said the flight then in
                    progress half way around the world had been aborted. The JRC working with all
                    services and agencies did a good job of limiting the chance for incidents.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other committees were you dealing with? When were you
                        ofthe Reconnaissance Committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>McAFEE: I dropped off the committee [around 1972] when I became the deputy
                    director of INR and then later Deputy Assistant Secretary [during Ray Cline's
                    tenure as INR Director]. My main focus then was on overall inter-agency
                    relations with CIA and DOD. Covert operations became much more front and
                    center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you move to this job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: I moved into the part of INR that handled this sort of matter in 1970 as
                    an assistant to the deputy director. Then in August 1973 I was made the deputy
                    director (later deputy assistant secretary). I worked in that field actually
                    from 1966 through 1986, twenty years. I also was involved with reconnaissance
                    because I liked it and tended to keep my hand in such activity.</p>
                <p>Q: President Carter came in 1977 and left in 1981. Then Ronald Reagan came in
                    1981 and was there when you retired. Did you see a change in our attitude
                    towards reconnaissance or aggressive covert activities with the arrival of the
                    Carter administration?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: You know it is a curious thing but I am not sure there ever was any clear
                    demarcation. Carter certainly put human rights front and center, and that was a
                    whole separate activity. Carter had Brzezinski as his National Security Advisor
                    and Cy Vance as his secretary of state, so, he had two very opposite types.
                    Vance, I think, generally preferred the diplomatic approach whereas Brzezinski
                    was very much a hard-liner with interest in the covert operations side. I don't
                    think there ever was any significant change with the arrival of Carter. The
                    Afghanistan program got started under Carter. Carter also, and most people don't
                    remember this, in the middle of his term reversed the decline in the DOD budget
                    started under Nixon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even with Stansfield Turner at CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Turner tended to have a low opinion of the clandestine and covert side.
                    He tended to be much more technically oriented; spend your money on technical
                    satellites and listening devices. He was very gung-ho but not at all gung-ho on
                    covert operations. He was on DDO's most wanted list.</p>
                <p>Turner had for instance a very low opinion of the plan to rescue the hostages in
                    Teheran. Finding the USIB too large he had set up a small executive group with a
                    State representative, officers from DOD and NSA, and himself. The Director of
                    INR who was the State representative sometimes delegated me to go in his place,
                    which I did after the failure of the [hostage rescue]. Turner, after expressing
                    his low opinion of the planning and low chance of success, started a briefing on
                    it - then quickly changed the subject. I would have been interested in what he
                    had to say.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in 1986...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: In mid-1980, after I served six or seven years as deputy, I still wanted
                    to work but requested to be stepped back. I think civil servants should have the
                    option of getting into some of the senior jobs, but I don't think they should
                    get there and figure this is a lifetime appointment, so I specifically dropped
                    back a peg. But I was still involved, working until 1986. [My title until
                    retirement was Director of the Office of Intelligence Liaison, INR/IC.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the whole El Salvador, Nicaragua business
                        during thtime you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: As I said earlier, at times covert actions have been run [outside] the
                    normal mechanisms, Chile by Kissinger, and more recently Nicaragua... In this
                    latter case it wasn't run around State because Elliot Abrams, ARA assistant
                    secretary, was very active in it, but it was run around the normal coordinating
                    mechanism. INR was cut out and both [programs] in the long run caused a lot more
                    harm than good. I sound like a sour bureaucrat; who knows what positions we
                    would have taken under the then current pressures.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your overall impression during this long time when you are looking at
                    intelligence operations from the view point of the State Department? I am not
                    talking about traditional spying which we will talk about later, but did you get
                    involved in covert operations fomenting rebellion and all this? I was wondering
                    what your impression was during the time you were dealing with this sort of
                    thing of its effectiveness?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: For instance, the rebellion in Iran fomented by Kermit Roosevelt, which
                    was before my day; I think State got involved willingly and it restored the
                    Shah. There is nothing intrinsic that says you have to be against covert
                    operations. But major ones can't be kept secret, and it is normally wiser to go
                    the overt route. Lots of cases involved interfering in local elections. We go
                    bonkers when we think the Chinese interfered in a presidential election in this
                    country with money, but you would think the Western Hemisphere was [at stake] by
                    the amount of pressure there was to try to get Cheddi Jagan down in British
                    Guyana defeated. I remember a CIA man saying to me that we ought to be
                    embarrassed because the votes were being carried in in bales. The most famous,
                    and long term, and most well known covert operation was in Italy, one of the
                    most successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The election of 1948.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes, and later. It was initially authorized by NSC1/1. It probably
                    prevented a communist take over of the Italian government. We didn't announce
                    it, but we supported the Christian Democrats with funds and know-how over many
                    years. Actually, we and the CIA agreed in the seventies that the time had come
                    to get out. CIA particularly wanted out. Freddy Reinhardt made a trip back once
                    asking that the program continue and not be phased out. He didn't want any
                    election lost on his watch, but we continued to phase it out. By then the
                    Italians were ready to run their own affairs. After it had stopped, President
                    Nixon sent a memo over to the Secretary; somebody got to him. He said that we
                    had to support our friends the Christian Democrats. The memo was sent down to us
                    and we said that everybody agreed that the time had come to get out. It went
                    back over to the White House and Nixon agreed. Over many years it made a major
                    positive impact.</p>
                <p>One of my earliest recollections on covert operations came when Bob Murphy called
                    for an INR representative to be at his office for a meeting with DDO
                    representatives. Des Fitzgerald and Tom Karamassines and I were at the meeting
                    during which the under secretary spoke very directly of the Department's great
                    unhappiness over the failure of an operation directed against Syria. It had been
                    thoroughly compromised, achieved nothing and left us with a bad name for quite a
                    time. State had apparently been assured of its secrecy. For the record, [often]
                    the policy bureaus support or propose covert operations; they are the ones under
                    the gun to produce results and DDO often could help. INR tended to be more
                    reserved about the long term prospects for such operations.</p>
                <p>In the early years of the Cold War, CIA operated a number of proprietaries -
                    ostensibly civilian companies such as China Air Transport and Air America. These
                    were effective tools of the U.S., but were soon recognized for what they
                    were.</p>
                <p>In covert operations, U.S. involvement is supposedly deniable but our involvement
                    soon becomes evident. Most of the time it makes sense to do things overtly,
                    though CIA's access to funds provides a lot of possibilities. On certain smaller
                    type activities, CIA can conceal its hand. An ambassador in a Latin American
                    country telegraphed an article in a local paper reporting with pleasure that
                    people were starting to see the light. The stations chief had to tell him it was
                    a plant.</p>
                <p>Chile, of course, has been written up no end. We got heavily involved in Angola
                    and you wonder sometimes what the final box score is going to be. How to prevent
                    the communists from taking over Angola was a life and death matter with the Cold
                    War going at full blast. We were backing [Jonas] Savimbi and his people [UNITA].
                    It means that an awful lot of arms of one kind or another flood into a country
                    and soon or later you just lose control. Actually CIA was given a directive to
                    try to insure that there be a good showing at the time of an election. Well, it
                    was quite plain the current was moving toward the communist side and their
                    sympathizers, but, CIA had quite an effective program for a while.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>The other one that comes to mind is Afghanistan. I remember one of the senior
                    officials of the Agency saying, “It looks as if it is going to be the first
                    invasion by bus,” because the Russians had so much transport at the border.
                    There were questions of what to do. There was a massive program through Pakistan
                    which didn't want to be fingered as being the base, but everyone knew it was run
                    through Pakistan, to oppose a Soviet take over, a goal it achieved but we don't
                    have a very happy situation in Afghanistan now, nor in Angola.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any disquiet expressed on your various
                        committees abousome of these operations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>McAFEE: These operations were coordinated by CIA directly with the policy bureaus
                    and INR, with final approval by the Forty Committee. We opposed quite a few
                    operations. We supported, for instance, the program for Angola and we strongly
                    supported the one for Afghanistan. We supported Italy until we concluded that
                    time had run out. We always supported Radio Free Europe, which is semi-overt.
                    Back in the mid-sixties we opposed a program for Radio Free Asia. Its history is
                    sort of an interesting insight as to how our procedures work. It was to be a
                    $47-48 million program for the first three or four years. The argument was to
                    look at Radio Free Europe and how it works, how good it is, and do the same in
                    east Asia. We said that China, the chief target, did not present the same
                    situation, that a new start up radio would not have credibility. We believed
                    USIA should step up its broadcasts as much as needed. Dick Stuart, a very able
                    DDC officer, (I worked with Dick thirty years before I knew he was summa cum
                    laude from Washington and Lee) sat down and talked to us one day. He said that
                    everybody had signed off on it. There was a committee, I think five
                    distinguished people - one a major radio executive, the head of USIA, etc. -
                    they all signed off on it. Dick said, that Bill Bundy had signed off on it, and
                    that Dick Helms had signed off on it, but that none of them thought it was the
                    way to go. They had approved it as a Cold War initiative. He drafted a memo for
                    Alex Johnson and said that we didn't think the audience or credibility was
                    there, the Chinese could jam it if they wanted to and we believed it better to
                    go through present facilities, having USIA step up and adjust its programs as
                    directed. We also said to Alex that this has been approved by so many people
                    [reconsidering the program was] now heresy. If you really feel the way we do,
                    that it is a waste of money and possibly counter-productive, take the
                    initiative. Alex took the initiative and explained that China isn't Russia, the
                    broadcasts would lack credibility and could be wiped out and we could do what
                    was necessary through USIA. The radio executive from the private section who had
                    been on the committee was sitting there and said he couldn't agree more,
                    although he had originally signed off for it. Bill Bundy, who had initially
                    signed off in favor of it, had later signed off approving our memo to Alex
                    reversing his position. The USIA man came out and made his position known saying
                    they would welcome a directive to step up their broadcasts. Dick Helms said we
                    developed this program because we thought we were responding to a common need
                    and [he was willing now to withdraw support. It is amazing that] something that
                    had the title covert could get started and have a full head of steam. Just as
                    you said, people believe something because it is secret; they favor something
                    because it is covert.</p>
                <p>A program generally in the public domain, though details have not been released,
                    concerned Portugal as it was emerging from years of dictatorship and facing
                    elections. State and CIA, the embassy and station, all supported it and the
                    ambassador and his top associate kept in close touch with an able station chief.
                    The program was believed to have made a contribution to the favorable outcome of
                    the election and there was no publicity over it. It was considered an example of
                    when and how a covert operation should be run.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>Q: During the time you were dealing with all of these activities, what were some
                    of the thought processes that were going on about the Soviet Union being an
                    empire with all sorts of different ethnic groups that really didn't fit together
                    very well as witnessed by today when it is broken up into about 12 different
                    component parts?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: Let me start with a defector. I was in a military reserve unit and after
                    a fairly key Russian defector was made openly available by CIA, we were able to
                    corner him to talk to us because we had some press people in the unit. He said,
                    “You know there is a lot of talk about breaking up the Soviet Union but this is
                    nonsense. There are a lot of problems in the Soviet Union. I left it because of
                    all the problems. But there is a very strong love of the motherland and this
                    idea of breaking it up is just not going to get anywhere.” He was taken up on
                    the Hill and met with committees up there. A month or two later we had him back
                    and he said, “You know what you have to do? You have to work on the Soviet
                    Union; it is ready to split up.” He had been subjected on the Hill and other
                    places to the view that we could split the Soviet Union and he reversed himself
                    one hundred percent.</p>
                <p>We in INR thought that Brzezinski was in left field when he pressed for this
                    option. Brzezinski favored a great deal of activity to spread disaffection among
                    the minorities and we thought it was poppycock. Okay, what is the answer now? I
                    just don't know. I don't think that when the Soviet Union was strong and in its
                    power that we had any real leverage on breaking it up through covert
                    operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would the question of doing something there crop up from
                        time ttime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes, it was constantly coming up, frequently raised by people outside the
                    executive branches and by and large the Russian specialists in State and
                    elsewhere said covert operations for this end were just not going to get
                    anywhere though everyone supported Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe.
                    Developments that finally split the Soviet Union were much more basic than any
                    activity that we could have started covertly.</p>
                <p>Q: In fact, when it happened we were kind of unhappy with it because it was a
                    little more difficult to deal with. At the time you were dealing with it we
                    really didn't make any sustained effort to put ethnic group against ethnic group
                    or something like that?</p>
                <p>McAFEE: Not to my knowledge when it was breaking up but by the end of 1986 I had
                    retired. There may have been a significant step up in broadcast capability. The
                    U.S. was planning facilities somewhere to program material into the Soviet Union
                    from another part of the world as opposed to RFE and Radio Liberty. I don't know
                    the score on that which was not a covert operation. Intelligence collection of
                    all types, human, technical were always in high gear.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were dealing with these things was Cuba sort of
                        kepoff to one side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Cuba always got attention. The whole CIA program to try to assassinate
                    Castro predated my time in the covert coordinating mechanism. I have no idea how
                    much State was involved. I was amazed when, after Kennedy was assassinated and
                    people started asking whether Oswald was Castro's revenge, to learn that there
                    had been so many programs attempting to get at Castro one way or another.
                    Apparently there was obsessive pressure to get rid of Castro personally. There
                    were also plans to harm Cuba economically by contamination of shipments of sugar
                    and the like. The Bay of Pigs was the major anti-Castro effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This didn't pass through your organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: At that time, covert operations were coordinated by a staff in the under
                    secretary's office. How such proposals passed through State I don't know. CIA
                    later was critical of Rusk for opposing air support, so there was coordination
                    with State. After the Church/Pike hearings got started in the seventies, a White
                    House man called me and said, “I want to come over and look at your files on
                    assassination.” I said, “We don't have any.” “Well,” he said, “I want to come
                    over and have access to whatever you do have.” I talked to a group in INR's
                    Directorate for Coordination [INR/DDC] and we ransacked the files and I do not
                    remember anything at all coming out of our files about assassinating Castro,
                    but, it was obvious that the question of Trujillo in the Dominican Republic had
                    been the subject of high level discussion. He was done in by his own countrymen
                    using arms they got separately, but, in our files there was evidence that there
                    had been discussions about what do you do about Trujillo. Enemies within the
                    Dominican Republic studied the routes he took coming home on weekends and staked
                    them out, eventually catching him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned there was something else you want to talk
                        about.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>McAFEE: This is a totally separate matter, but it was kept amazingly secret for
                    years. Whatever I talk about is open now. The CIA developed a plan to raise a
                    Soviet submarine that sank out in the Pacific. It was first presented to the
                    Forty Committee as $28 million research program to see what we could do about
                    raising it. Everybody goes along. It gets approved step by step and eventually
                    the cost is between $300 and $400 million. If that price had been set initially
                    more questions would have been asked. They built the ship. I was deputy
                    assistant secretary and the action officer for State. I was briefed by CIA and
                    my secretary was briefed. The director of INR had clearance and the under
                    secretary for political affairs was cleared, but when papers were coordinated I
                    would carry them into the director of INR and sit there and carry them out. And
                    I would do that with Alex. If Alex had to have more time he would say, “I'll
                    hold this Bill and call you.” But they never went through normal staff
                    procedures. They were hand carried in and carried out by me. I thought the
                    operation was high risk, that putting that big a ship in that area would catch
                    Soviet attention; a warship even if sunk remains the property of its nation, but
                    the Soviets never focused on it. The operation almost came off. When the
                    submarine was being raised, the CIA had me out as the guest of honor Sunday for
                    a briefing on the status [of the operation, so we] knew where it was and how far
                    up it was. It was exciting. On Monday [came] the catastrophe when the ship
                    wobbled. They had lost a good bit of the submarine. There never was a detailed
                    release on what was achieved intelligence-wise. The operational failure came
                    when one of the claws holding the submarine broke. Finally they decided on a
                    second try. We thought that they were pushing their luck to think they could go
                    back to that same area and do it again, particularly since twin crews had been
                    briefed, but the ship was getting ready when one of the crew members got drunk
                    in a bar on the west coast and told about being in on this macho project which
                    got in the press. This killed it off. [Nevertheless], the whole project showed
                    CIA's great operational capabilities.</p>
                <p>When the Air Force planned to develop its stealth bomber, they went to CIA to
                    talk security procedures because they wanted to know how Azorean, which had so
                    many people involved, had been kept so secret. And, I think primarily it was
                    initially a good cover story, deep ocean mining, briefing fully as few as
                    possible, putting as little down on paper as you have to, not leaving papers
                    where they can be worked over. It was a good security system, and the project
                    certainly proved the feasibility of what was planned, politically and
                    operationally.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the “Glomar Explorer?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: The mid-seventies.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>You know, there was another project that was kind of curious and I was quite
                    amused at myself in this company. Bob Nacka was the assistant secretary of the
                    Air Force for research and development. He called and asked me to be a member of
                    a working group. I went over to the Pentagon and there were Nacka and a couple
                    of lieutenant generals and one of the very senior DDO people, and Kelly Johnson,
                    who was the designer of the U-2 and the SR-71 from Lockheed, and me. Technical
                    substance wise, it made me think of how people described Eisenhower's cabinet as
                    ten millionaires and a plumber. Anyway, what they were talking about was a
                    stealth capability, stealth before stealth became a by-word, and applying it to
                    the SR-71. It would mean quite a lot of money to redo the SR-71 and give it that
                    capability. I kept wondering what I was there for, but it came out at the end.
                    We all favored the program if the money was available. At the end they turned to
                    me and said, “Bill, the major problem with overflights, of course, is that they
                    offend other governments and they become unhappy and send a protest to State.
                    You all must be strongly in favor of this project because we can overfly
                    countries without their knowing it and it won't have political costs. Will you
                    start the memo up the line that says it is worth the expenditure?” In other
                    words, would State say for political reasons it is worth spending x hundred
                    million dollars. I said in effect it has a real capability and if you want to
                    develop it, put a proposal into the NSC and let everybody think about it and we
                    will put in our two cents there hopefully in support. Actually I wished they had
                    gone ahead with the program and I was sorry when they later mothballed the
                    SR-71.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the work of foreign intelligence?
                        I aspeaking about the British and other friendly intelligence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Our office was liaison. I kept the portfolio because I liked it. We [had
                    a] liaison [relationship] with the British, the Canadians, the Australians and
                    the New Zealanders. Other agencies handled extensive liaison with other
                    countries. Jim Angleton of CIA, for instance, handled liaison with Israel which
                    is very sensitive. The Commonwealth countries always assigned absolutely first
                    rate men to the embassies here. The U.S. is a big dog in the fight and they all
                    had a high regard for our intelligence capabilities. The first liaison officer
                    we worked with, Tom Brimelow, later became the permanent under secretary in the
                    U.K. foreign office. Eddie Boland became an ambassador in one of the Bloc
                    countries. Roger Carrick became the U.K. high commissioner in Australia. Most of
                    the Canadians assigned became chiefs of mission. A New Zealander became
                    assistant to the prime minister down there for years. One of the Australians
                    became their ambassador in Moscow, another in Madrid; however their careers
                    ended, they were outstanding people.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>There was a great deal of substantive exchange. Dick Helms said once at some
                    meeting that there wasn't any use for the Russians wasting their effort trying
                    to do second story jobs in the U.S. because we had given everything to the
                    Canadians and they ought to go up there and raid their files. I don't think he
                    was making an adverse comment on Canadian security, but he was unhappy about the
                    great amount of intelligence of all types being transferred. The Commonwealth
                    had access to the best product of our intelligence system. I think it was a
                    worthwhile exchange. We received in return their sophisticated intelligence
                    analyses and their signals intercept product, the latter often unique. The
                    British in particular had a reputation for traditionally strong reporting from
                    certain key posts. We also had major intelligence facilities in most of these
                    countries. The exchanges were by no means a one way street though I enjoyed
                    telling our British friends that the exchanges would not be complete until they
                    gave us in their reports from Washington. I am certain the exchanges were of
                    great use to them and for us in supporting inter-governmental relations. New
                    Zealand for instance was profoundly unhappy when the U.S. cut off intelligence
                    exchanges [in the mid-1980s], after they refused U.S. Navy visits unless we
                    identified which vessels had nuclear capabilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impression you were getting about the ability
                        of thSoviet and bloc espionage system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: We were always very much aware of the extent to which they carried on
                    espionage at all levels and in various ways. I remember a briefing once with the
                    idea that if you think your vault is secure, listen to this. We had a locked
                    door with a combination, and then a locked walk in combination safe on alarm
                    downstairs. Apparently the Soviets had an exceptionally high powered x-ray and a
                    team that could work such systems to detect the combination on a safe and then
                    open it. They spent money and effort and lives freely in espionage. I think
                    early on some people were susceptible to recruitment because they thought
                    communism might be an answer to some of the world's problems and thought in
                    those terms as opposed to the [image of the] U.S.S.R. as an imperialist power. I
                    think there was much less of that in the last 30 years or so.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>I remember clearly a memo sent around State 50 years ago about a young officer
                    and his wife, who belonged to a skating club in which there were Soviets with
                    whom they became friendly. In response to a request they provided an
                    unclassified military manual. Later the Russian told them Moscow had appreciated
                    receiving it and offered or paid them a small amount of money and then asked for
                    another manual - with a low classification. At that point realizing the score,
                    they went to security and he was discharged. I thought that by that time he had
                    learned and would not be a risk and was sorry for him, but maybe there was more
                    to the case than I knew. Recruitment went on all the time at all levels. An
                    officer in the embassy, Moscow, told of taking a boat trip, with a private
                    cabin. In the middle of the night, a woman unlocked the door, came in and went
                    to bed in the other berth. He decided the best thing to do was to ignore her.
                    Going back to WWII days, their ability to steal the secrets of the atom bomb
                    shows their capability. The Soviets may not have known how to run an economic
                    system but they knew chapter and verse about an espionage system, and one of the
                    reasons the Bay of Pigs failed was that one of the Soviets' first exports to
                    Cuba was a security system. Look at their record of recruiting U.S. officials -
                    Ames, the most famous, but also Howard, Walker, and Pelton to name recent
                    ones.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Soviets used our system of paying people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes. An ambassador to an African country, back in DC [on home leave] came
                    to see me, and said that CIA wanted to conduct an operation and he spelled it
                    out; they wanted to bug a man's house. They told the COM that they were looking
                    for information on Soviet nets in Africa. In a small capitol city the cost of
                    detection could have been significant. I went out to CIA to talk to them and it
                    turned out actually they didn't think the man they wanted to target was in on
                    sensitive Soviet activities, but they thought he might commit some indiscretions
                    which would give them a chance to proposition him and recruit him, give him a
                    small retainer now and then. CIA was working on its own net.</p>
                <p>If CIA wanted to use a State Department employee, or his quarters, according to
                    the terms of reference, which I am not sure they regularly followed, they came
                    to me or the person in my job and to SY [Office of Security]. SY for the
                    personal security clearance and us for the political clearance. There were times
                    when a State person might be living near a Russian. They were anxious in this
                    way or any way they could to penetrate a Soviet net because they were convinced,
                    and I think correctly, that the Soviets were working literally every single
                    facet in every country where they were. There was great respect for the extent
                    of the Soviet effort.</p>

                <p>McAFEE: And ideology. One of the more productive achievements on our side was
                    Penkovski. He was a most valuable source on Soviet missiles, but he was actually
                    an ideological defector whose father had suffered under the KGB. If I remember
                    rightly he made several approaches to British and American intelligence before
                    we finally decided to respond. It is nice to say that was a triumph of espionage
                    but it was more a triumph of happenstance.</p>
                <p>I heard from an embassy Moscow officer the story of the day the Soviets wrapped
                    up the case. An officer of the embassy planned to go downtown on a routine trip.
                    The COM asked him if he would mind if an officer of the CIA station joined him.
                    As the FSO was leaving the compound the CIA man came running out and begged a
                    ride to town to make it look like happenstance. They agreed to meet again at a
                    given time but the chauffeur, obviously a KGB agent, kept walking around and
                    saying he wondered what had happened to the other man - he knew that when the
                    CIA officer went to clear a drop he would be picked up. The CIA officer was,
                    under regular procedures, not held since he had diplomatic immunity. If, in
                    seeking to target terrorism and drugs and weapons of mass destruction, we move
                    more into private cover where people do not have diplomatic immunity, we are
                    going to have trouble arresting enough agents from the hostile countries for
                    exchanges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should talk about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: I'm not sure. We have pretty much covered the water front. Let me mention
                    again one point. Overt intelligence gets underestimated. One of my early jobs
                    was coordinating publication procurement; a vast amount of intelligence is
                    available overtly in the publications of a country. People sometimes think that
                    Foreign Service reporting is basically unclassified information but that is just
                    not the case. FSOs talk to senior officials who have insights and these are the
                    most basic exchanges on countries' national interests. I felt over the years
                    that Foreign Service reporting did the best job of describing the meaning and
                    bearing and what was happening in a country. Clandestine reporting is highly
                    valuable but the essential direction of a country is I think picked up and
                    described best in depth by the Foreign Service, and I think State never has done
                    a very good job in selling that point.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>The most famous single example would probably be George Kennan's report from
                    Moscow right after the war setting forth the concept of containment which was
                    the basis for U.S. policy for the next forty years. Secretary Shultz assessed
                    the value of Foreign Service reporting by saying it was the single most
                    important source of information relating to foreign affairs, providing
                    information on the thoughts and plans of foreign leaders; information on the
                    factors which influenced their decisions; information on how decisions were
                    made; information on how other countries would react to U.S. policies. I have
                    always found that FS reporting revealed access, knowledge in depth, and first
                    rate analysis. In a quick review years ago of such reporting in a limited area
                    over a limited period a reviewer noted reports on: the Soviet attitude toward
                    the Iran/Iraq war, Turkish plans re Cyprus, the PLO and the peace process,
                    Egyptian concerns over U.S. actions in the Middle East, military plans in
                    Cambodia during the dry season, INF and basing problems - hardly a tea and
                    crumpets agenda.</p>
                <p>Military attach� collection can be very useful. I served for a time on a
                    committee that considered organization of the military intelligence community.
                    Allan Evans was the State representative and Graves Erskine, a 4-star Marine
                    [Corps] general, and Lyman Kirkpatrick, the third man at CIA comprised the
                    committee. Allan then had to go overseas so I filled in. It immediately became
                    evident that what the committee was going to recommend was primarily a Defense
                    attach� overseas, senior to the service attach�s, and DIA [Defense Intelligence
                    Agency] to supervise Army, Navy, and Air Force intelligence here in Washington.
                    The idea was [that] DIA would handle the whole ball of wax, and the other
                    service intelligence units would wither away. We in State said it would be
                    adding another level, which it certainly has done. The Defense attach� [system]
                    was set up; DIA was set up; and the Army, Navy and Air Force intelligence units
                    are bigger now than they ever were before. The services feel strongly,
                    understandably, about having their own intelligence support.</p>
                <p>On the value of military reporting, I remember one case in point when I was most
                    grateful for attach� reporting. President Eisenhower was leaving Washington
                    early one morning during the Egypt-Israel crisis of 1956, and asked State for a
                    brief of intelligence received over night on the likelihood of war breaking out.
                    It fell to me to review that and neither State, CIA, nor NSA had any info
                    bearing on the likelihood of military action. The Army attach� in Tel Aviv was
                    in with two reports; one reported the disappearance of civilian transport from
                    the streets; the other passed on a report that a thousand beds had been
                    requisitioned in local hospitals. He concluded this was either an expensive
                    cover plan or a prelude to hostilities, which started later that day.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>[The military attach�s presented a control problem from time to time.] During the
                    Cold War we had frequent incidents in the U.S.S.R. from attach� activities.
                    There was some feeling that unless an attach� pushed the collection envelope to
                    the point of creating an incident he was not doing his job. A famous case
                    involved several attach�s who traveled across the U.S.S.R. on the Trans Siberian
                    railway taking along lots of sophisticated collection gear, photographic and
                    otherwise. They were not closely surveilled much to their pleasure until they
                    reached eastern Siberia where they were stopped and all their cameras etc. were
                    confiscated - along with voluminous notes. The Soviets had sand bagged them. At
                    least in some cases the number of incidents reflected the fact that the COM was
                    unwilling to spend the time to work with the attach�s - though I do not think
                    that was the case in Moscow.</p>
                <p>Perhaps of more concern was the activity of military clandestine collection
                    units. Each of the services at one time had these, with headquarters in the D.C.
                    area or nearby. They had overseas units at a limited number of places such as
                    Frankfurt. Not being part of the embassy staffs, coordination of their
                    activities presented problems. I made a trip to Europe in 1977 to look into the
                    problem and all the services extended full cooperation. In theory, the DCI had
                    authority to coordinate all clandestine activities, but lines get fuzzy when
                    dealing with military commands, and spending time coordinating the activity of
                    others took time from CIA officers' own collection work. The Navy at this time
                    decided to abolish its unit - not a response to my survey - for the decision had
                    been in the works. INR at the time I retired in 1986 was mounting a major effort
                    to improve coordination. I repeat here what I may have said before: it is good
                    to have people push the envelope at times, but, made a way of life, it risks
                    becoming counterproductive intelligence wise and certainly from a foreign
                    relations standpoint.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any individual cases come to mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: An interesting example of individual collection activity by a military
                    officer came to light during the Cold War when an ambassador sent in a Roger
                    (intelligence operations) channel telegram asking for any info on Operation Flat
                    Pass. We went to CIA which professed ignorance and then to DOD which [after a
                    delay] got back to us. In a country bordering the U.S.S.R. a military attach�
                    had developed a plan with the host government military which included placing a
                    transponder near the Soviet border in a sensitive area. This was to be carried
                    out without notification to the senior military or the senior political
                    authorities in the host government. EUR on learning of the operation said that
                    if the Soviets had learned of it they would have brought pressure on the
                    government that could have changed its political orientation.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>State's concern is not to make sure its ticket is punched. There can be costs in
                    too aggressive intelligence collection. In this case, major international
                    pressure on a friendly country by a big and overwhelming neighbor. In the case
                    mentioned earlier re Singapore, the prime minister thought a U.S. indiscretion
                    might be worth $150 million. In India, when Madame Ghandi found we had suborned
                    a cabinet associate whom she confided in, she was profoundly unhappy, but her
                    resentment against us was dulled by the revelation that he was also in Soviet
                    pay. A blown operation has costs for normal ongoing activities since a
                    revelation is followed by tighter security. An officer who has been trained for
                    years at government expense can be PNGed [persona non grata] ending his service
                    in his country of concern. I think it is necessary to have aggressive collection
                    at times - in the long run a creative tension between collectors and those
                    assessing political costs is probably not a bad situation.</p>
                <p>Q: Getting back to the reorganization issue, when the Defense Intelligence Agency
                    was formed it just was an add on, and a lot of coordination problems remain.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>McAFEE: Yes, that is the case. The other time I was on a committee considering
                    the intelligence community was when one was established by President Ford, and I
                    was the State representative. There were good people from OMB and CIA and DOD.
                    Hank Knocke, who later became the deputy in CIA, was the CIA representative. The
                    thing that was fascinating was to see the proposals that came in. CIA presented
                    a proposal which was for a czar with the DCI in charge of the whole community
                    and with line authority over the whole community including the funding. Defense
                    reps entitled their proposal “The Strengthened DCI” and called for the DCI to
                    set requirements and coordinate the final intelligence product, but it left
                    funding totally with Defense for all of its projects. It was a strengthened DCI
                    in facade only. I had asked Bill Deary to work with me in view of his drafting
                    ability. We proposed a DCI responsible to the President for the intelligence
                    programs of the U.S. Government, and to the Congress. He presented the budget to
                    both; he was responsible for the substance of inter-agency estimates and papers
                    and for the coordination of requirements to meet the needs of all agencies and
                    departments - the NSC, State, DOD and to be responsive to Congress on the above;
                    he tasked all the major technical collection systems; he was in charge of CIA,
                    not the head of a separate staff as some had proposed. We felt he needed a staff
                    which CIA could most adequately provide whereas a separate DCI would then need a
                    separate staff. The different angle of State's proposal lay in its calling for a
                    collegial community with all the agencies having a vote on major budget items.
                    This must have amused CIA and DOD to see INR with its 300 staff proposing
                    equality with them and their thousands but we thought of INR's vote as
                    representing all the interests of State. Our view was that if you can't make a
                    collegial community work, how can you make a dictatorship work. Interestingly
                    enough, Bill Colby, the DCI, selected, and President Ford signed off on, a
                    program close to State's collegial concept, which CIA almost immediately branded
                    a total failure. The next time there is an overall review of intelligence look
                    for CIA to again say the answer is a czar.One example of how the collegial
                    system worked. Phil Habib was our member at one of the very first meetings on
                    major financial allocations. We got into the car to go to the White House and he
                    said, “Bill, out of the various proposals tell me what is most important.” Dick
                    Curl, a very able officer, had drafted a paper giving our priorities and I
                    emphasized them to Phil. One of the programs that he pushed for was a program
                    that neither Defense nor CIA wanted to go along with, using some of our overhead
                    capabilities for non-military targets. Phil said that it would not only be of
                    interest to State, but we thought CIA and the military would learn a lot about
                    who does what and where industrially. He got approval for $50 million. A year
                    later we were pleased when the Pentagon, with CIA concurrence, put the program
                    in for $150 million. I like a collegial organization, but it did not last long.
                    The Congress, NSC and CIA want a czar, one person to be held responsible.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McAFEE: Mr. Hoover was very unhappy that his reports sent to State were not being
                    appropriately disseminated, so a unit of eight officers was set up to look at
                    every FBI report and highlight everything pertinent to various bureaus and get
                    it around. I knew from the people assigned to it that, though they were good
                    people, they weren't going to be substantive, they did not have that type of
                    prior experience. We later figured that it was costing us over $2.00 to
                    distribute around State every FBI report, whereas the CIA and military reports
                    that came in cost just pennies to circulate. Hoover after a while forgot about
                    the program and we abolished the unit, but continued to circulate to all
                    interested officers the FBI reports.</p>
                <p>At one point, Hoover assigned representatives to a number of posts for
                    essentially political reporting. He simply sent them out. He said he talked to
                    President Nixon and the President said that he wanted people who would report
                    directly to Hoover and him. A friend of mine was in Denmark when an FBI man
                    arrived, not well briefed and he was soon withdrawn.</p>
                <p>The most interesting confrontation over these assignments came in Tel Aviv. Owen
                    Zurhellen was in charge of the mission. The FBI man refused to show him what he
                    was sending. People were quite surprised when the man came and immediately
                    started looking for something new and different. He picked up some old sources
                    CIA felt were unreliable and we were concerned about the possibility of
                    inflammatory reports coming in to the White House. Anyhow Zurhellen insisted he
                    wanted to see the reports and the FBI man said he wouldn't show them. Zurhellen
                    locked him out of the code room and refused him any access to it. The issue then
                    came up at a high level between State and the FBI. State said our chief of
                    mission has to know the kind of reporting that is generated. Zurhellen won that
                    particular battle. Hoover didn't keep that system in effect very long. Now, I
                    think, there probably is a new set of FBI people abroad to work on terrorism and
                    drugs, a totally different assignment and more in line with the FBI's work here
                    in the U.S. I think the coordination problem that is going to exist among them,
                    CIA, State and other agencies must be reasonably complicated.</p>

                <p>I once talked to Bill Cregar about their activities around Washington, where the
                    FBI has the charter. They can subvert a foreign diplomat so he will tell them
                    what his mission is doing and when he goes overseas they will turn him over to
                    the CIA. They can penetrate foreign embassies. We thought some of their
                    activities might be getting quite sensitive and I talked to Bill about political
                    costs and he said, “No, that is our business. We judge the political risk
                    involved in that.” We went up the line and a group of us went down to the FBI.
                    George Vest, a very good man, headed it up. The FBI officers were more obdurate
                    in terms of what they were going to coordinate with State than CIA ever was.
                    Their skill in doing their job was revealed by the fact that we rarely got
                    formal complaints from embassies here. On occasion the FBI and State worked
                    closely on cases where foreigners who were known espionage agents were planning
                    trips to the U.S. When they planned to arrest a foreign embassy official in
                    connection with espionage they normally gave us notification very late in the
                    case. I remember one case when the FBI called and said that shortly before 5:00
                    PM they planned to detain an official from an Eastern European embassy. I
                    immediately notified State's policy bureau which asked if the FBI could defer
                    any announcement until they had notified some people up the line. The FBI said
                    sorry but the news release of the arrest had already been given to a radio
                    station in the concerned city for release at 5:00 PM. I don't know what the
                    score is now on FBI coordination, either between the mission chief, or between
                    State and the Bureau. But, I can imagine it is a continuing problem.</p>

                <p>McAFEE: A parting work about INR.</p>
                <p>INR/DDC [INR's Directorate for Coordination or its later designation, the Office
                    of Intelligence Liaison] was at the intelligence cross roads of State, CIA, DOD
                    and the FBI, among others. That made for controversy and made the work
                    interesting. On my last day or so I was involved in two such cases. The Near
                    East Bureau had drafted a letter to Justice on the Pollard case. In their
                    letter, NEA stated that his espionage only involved matters directly concerning
                    Israeli security. [Pollard's activities] went much beyond that according to
                    information provided by the FBI, so we did not concur in NEA's letter. When NEA
                    reraised the issue it was resolved by INR's assistant secretary Mort Abramowitz,
                    who sided with us.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>The other case involved a memo Ed Peck, a senior officer and former ambassador,
                    had drafted: a message from the Secretary to chiefs of mission on their
                    responsibilities. He had come across a memo drafted in a prior time saying to
                    the COMs that their authority flowed from the President to the Secretary, to the
                    assistant secretary and then to him - a far cry from their role as the personal
                    representative of the President. Ed proposed changing this in which we concurred
                    (I do not know if the prior memo had been cleared with INR) and then said, in
                    effect, that the President shared his foreign policy responsibilities with the
                    Secretary and with the chief of mission. He then wrote that the concerned
                    assistant secretary would provide the COM administrative support in his
                    decisions. I though this down graded State's role and sent it in to the front
                    office. Frank McNeil, an FSO and prior COM suggested adding the words, “He will
                    authorize instructions in my (the secretary's) name.” This struck me as a
                    reasonable compromise but the ex-COM did not buy it and his draft then
                    circulated, with INR's proposed wording as dissent. Every politically appointed
                    assistant secretary insisted on using the INR language. Every FSO assistant
                    secretary except one preferred Ed's draft. The exception was Roz Ridgway of EUR
                    who sent Mr. Shultz a memo saying that she already had difficulty getting
                    political ambassadors to accept her guidelines and with the new draft, her job
                    would become impossible. The secretary as I understand it put the memo on hold.
                    Roz's memo was written after my retirement, but the day before, a senior officer
                    called and said he understood I was not willing to support the role of the COM.
                    My last memo was to say to him, I thought I had through the years supported a
                    strong and deciding role for the COM but the big decisions were fought out in
                    Washington and the assistant secretaries played a major role in inter-agency
                    coordination, far beyond providing administrative support to the COM. I thought
                    it would be a mistake to weaken in anyway the department's role. That was my
                    swan song. I am sure my position reflected the jurisdictional prejudices of a
                    Washington based “simple barefoot” civil servant.</p>
                <p>Intelligence is always thought of as supporting policy which it should, but in
                    the Cold War one of the duties of policy was to support the collection of
                    intelligence needed for survival. Given the various threats we face that may
                    still be true.Thank you, I have enjoyed exploring the highways and byways of my
                    past this way. I found my years of government service most rewarding and hope
                    that some day the challenges it offers will come again to be appreciated. Forty
                    years in State were all interesting and I always enjoyed the company. My mother
                    used to repeat a line in her later years, probably from the Good Book but I am
                    not sure: “The lines have fallen unto us in pleasant places.” It certainly was
                    true for me.</p>

                <p>Note: In forwarding the draft manuscript to me, Mr. Kennedy invited me to add to
                    or amend my comments. The above paragraph on the Arakan campaign reflects a
                    considerable expansion of my initial remarks. There are a number of similar
                    additions throughout this oral history. I kept no diary or record of activities
                    either while in the Army or later at State. Events described are as I remember
                    them, in the above case over 50 years later. When I use direct quotations, these
                    are only to reflect my understanding of what was said.</p>
