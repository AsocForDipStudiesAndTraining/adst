                <p>AMBASSADOR JOHN A. FERCH</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: William E. Knight </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: September 27, 1991</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with retired Ambassador John A. Ferch
                        on September 27, 1991 under the Foreign Service Retirees Program and the
                        interviewer is William E. Knight, also retired Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>John, as you know this is your opportunity to say whatever you would like to say
                    about the Service and your experience in it. So it is your ball game and you
                    start out and lead it wherever you would like to and I will interject
                    occasionally, but basically this is your opportunity to say whatever you would
                    like to say.</p>
                <p>FERCH: Thank you Bill. I have thought of what I would like to discuss. Let me lay
                    this out as if it were the chapter headings. I would like to talk first about
                    how I got into the Foreign Service since I think most people probably get into
                    the Foreign Service in the same haphazard way. Then I'll outline my career of
                    some 30 years, simply noting the facts. I'll next discuss some of the major
                    issues I was involved in during the course of that career, drawing some
                    conclusions about what they signified for our foreign policy. Then I'll touch
                    upon management in the Foreign Service, something that I don't think we do too
                    well and in which I took personal interest. Next I would like to discuss the
                    role of the wife in the Foreign Service, something that I think is very, very
                    important and confronts the Service in our new day and age with major problems.
                    Then I would like to talk about how my career concluded, because it concluded in
                    a very politicized manner and therefore is a bit different from that of almost
                    all other Foreign Service Officers. I will end the interview by talking about my
                    satisfaction with the Foreign Service and the downsides I see in the Foreign
                    Service. So, let me get started with the beginning.</p>
                <p>I joined the Foreign Service for all the wrong reasons, as most people probably
                    do. I knew nothing about it. I was corrupted at an early age by the National
                    Geographic and became a map freak, became interested in strange, exotic lands
                    early on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nothing wrong with that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>FERCH: True, but not a good reason for going into the Foreign Service. It tells
                    you nothing about what the Foreign Service does.</p>
                <p>I come from Toledo, Ohio and was the first person in my family to go to high
                    school, much less college. In high school I had an interview, wholly
                    coincidental, with a recruiter from Princeton. I was sitting in an English class
                    in my senior year. I was a very successful student and leader of my high school,
                    being president of the student body. But I also was like every other teenager
                    and was often bored with studying. Over the loud speaker there was an
                    announcement that somebody from Princeton was down in the college room. I had
                    only the vaguest idea where Princeton was, but I said, “I am out of here, I have
                    to get out of this class.” So I went down there and eventually got a scholarship
                    to Princeton.</p>
                <p>It was Princeton that obviously equipped me to pass the Foreign Service
                    examination. I actually studied at Princeton throughout the four years with the
                    Foreign Service as an objective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was my case at Yale too. What class were you in at
                        Princeton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: The class of '58. I took all of the right courses. But fortunately, for
                    myself, I also took a lot of courses in art history, which has greatly enriched
                    my life, much more than some of the other courses.</p>
                <p>Between my junior and senior year I took the Foreign Service examination, the
                    written, and passed it. In September of my senior year I took the oral, passed
                    it and therefore at the beginning of my senior year I had a job. And in total
                    naivete I told the Service that they would have to wait for me to graduate, and
                    for reasons I never understood, they said, “Okay.” They said that I should call
                    when I graduated.</p>
                <p>During the year I also became engaged to my wife. I graduated and within a week
                    we got married. I called the State Department and said that I was going on my
                    honeymoon and they could call me when we get back. So we went on a seven week
                    honeymoon to her father's cabin in Canada, came back and called the Foreign
                    Service and was told to come on to Washington.</p>
                <p>Now this doesn't happen, and I know the Foreign Service is not geared to do this
                    and why it happened in my case I have no idea.</p>
                <p>Anyway, in September my wife and I piled our few possessions into an old car and
                    drove to Washington. She was 21 and I was 22. I entered the A100 course where
                    the average age of the class was 28 or 29 and everyone was able, had experience,
                    and we were just totally out of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>At that time one of the many Personnel assignment policies that the State
                    Department has had over the years was that new officers, after A100 and language
                    training, would spend their first tour in Washington. And sure enough, everyone
                    in class, all these experienced people, spent their first tours in Washington.
                    And the powers to be said, “Ferch goes to Argentina.” Now everyone in the class
                    was more qualified, more mature, and envious as all get out watched us leave for
                    The Pampas. We sailed down to Argentina and began a career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you already have Spanish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: I took Spanish in FSI.</p>
                <p>As I said, I joined for all the wrong reasons and the Service itself seemed to
                    lack reason in choosing my first posting. When I look back I can't imagine a
                    more confused Personnel policy that would take two kids who knew absolutely
                    nothing and send them abroad to defend US interests when all the more
                    experienced officers were kept home in rather dull jobs. This doesn't make any
                    sense at all. But, of course, like that class in my high school, it shaped my
                    life. It got me on the road to Latin American affairs, and because the second
                    year of my two year assignment down there was in the economic section...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First year was...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Consular work. I liked the economic work and had it in the back of my mind
                    to get the Department to send me back to school. I hadn't taken economics at
                    Princeton.</p>
                <p>I learned something in getting my second assignment. I was assigned to INR...of
                    course I didn't even know what INR was. Naivete has been my strong suit for
                    years and years. Another junior officer who had already left and was back in
                    Washington wrote me and said, “You can't go to INR, that is no good. You will
                    just bore yourself. I will get you a better job.” This has since shaped my
                    career. I don't think the assignment process has ever put me anywhere formally.
                    I haven't been one to go out and be a hard wheeler and dealer for assignments,
                    but I did realize that you had to get out in the corridor and look for your
                    assignments and make yourself known. That has shaped my career too.</p>
                <p>My next assignment, which this fellow helped me to get, was on our delegation to
                    the Organization of American States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did not go to INR at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>FERCH: I did not go to INR at all. How it is that people listened to such naivete
                    when I said that I didn't like that and would rather go some place else, I don't
                    know.But they did.</p>
                <p>I went to our mission to the OAS. So I had two assignments to ARA in a row. This
                    leads to another conclusion which I will try to come to next.</p>
                <p>The OAS was a good assignment. I was the very, very low man on the totem pole,
                    but coincidentally also on the mission at the time was Bill Bowdler, who
                    subsequently held many senior assignments— Ambassador to South Africa,
                    Ambassador to El Salvador and Guatemala, Assistant Secretary for ARA. That
                    contact led to two subsequent assignments. This just shows you how the Service
                    works.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the two salient aspects of the OAS assignment were that it imbedded my
                    interest in Latin America a bit more and also gave me the opportunity to do two
                    things. First, to lobby for an assignment in economic training. But while I was
                    in Washington, I also took advantage of the Department's programs to go to the
                    graduate school at George Washington University for economics in the evening. I
                    must have taken four courses in the four years.</p>
                <p>The Department did agree to send me to the University of Michigan. By now we are
                    at 1963-64. By now we had two kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Six years in the Service at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Well, four years before going to Michigan. A little bit more if you add in
                    the training program, home leave, etc. I left for Michigan in the fall of 1963.
                    That is five years after entering the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I was relatively fortunate in the courses I took at Michigan. Most of them proved
                    to be very relevant to my subsequent work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which did you consider particularly relevant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: There was a professor there by the name of Leonard Smith who had been on
                    the Council of Economic Advisers and he crafted a program called “Stabilization”
                    in which he brought together all of the disciplines of government economic
                    policies— monetary, fiscal, trade—and showed how they interact and how you can
                    use them in an interacting way to achieve stability. Stability would be defined
                    as a steady growth course. It was fairly intellectually challenging and
                    rewarding.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>In Michigan I started looking around for jobs. Here is where, as I alluded to
                    earlier, the regional direction of my career became fixed. I had made a minor
                    name for myself on the mission to the OAS, also, probably in Argentina, to a
                    degree. But I had not served anywhere else. So the only people who knew of me
                    were the people in ARA. Here I was an economist at the very time when the
                    Alliance of Progress was peaking. There was great need in ARA for economists
                    because we were throwing a lot of money into Latin America. I use that phrase
                    advisedly.</p>
                <p>So ARA was very interested in getting me back into ARA. I suppose the
                    Department's formal policy at that time was that I should have gone some place
                    else regionally. But ARA offered me an assignment as an economist in Bogota. It
                    was doing the hard economics—the balance of payments, the fiscal accounts. At
                    that time we were putting into the Colombian economy through AID resources
                    equivalent to over a third of their import bill. We were in Colombia in a big,
                    big way and were working very closely with Colombia's economic policy and had
                    great need for detailed reporting on the course of the Colombian economy. There
                    I learned to do basically an IMF type economic analysis where you do a monthly
                    report on the Colombian balance of payments, on the budget expenditures,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't there when I was down there on the aviation
                        negotiations were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: I don't recall. We had an officer in the economic section who had aviation
                    as his specialty so there must have been an issue there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: I don't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it had to be between '63 and '67 when I was in the
                        aviation negotiations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Well, I was there from 1964-67, three years. It was a very rewarding
                    period of time. We produced our last child. Nothing else significant happened
                    during that time. It was a wonderful Embassy. Covey Oliver was the Ambassador
                    for most of the time. He was just a great ambassador. The staff had a high
                    morale. I have been fortunate in serving in such posts and will talk about that
                    under management.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>From there I, in my wisdom, decided that I had to have my own post. Now think of
                    it, at this time, 1967, I was 31 years old. Why I thought that anyone was going
                    to give me my own post is beyond me. But I started looking around for separate
                    consulates in Latin America. The Embassy was very supportive of me. Henry
                    Dearborn, the DCM, was very supportive of me and I am sure that is why I
                    eventually got the post. But it is kind of funny because it shows once again
                    this galloping naivete.</p>
                <p>I was offered a post we no longer have in Peru called Arequipa. I got the post
                    report and it mentioned that spiders were a big problem. Well, my lovely wife
                    said no way was she going to that place. So I told them that I was not going to
                    go to Arequipa and was going to look for another place. Someone told me about a
                    post in the Dominican Republic called Santiago de los Caballeros, a place I
                    previously had never heard of. We had opened this post after Trujillo had died,
                    as a listening post, and in the fashion of all bureaucratic entities it had
                    grown fairly large. So, I said I would like to go there, and I went there.</p>
                <p>It was delightful. We arrived two months after the troops left and you would have
                    thought that the tension would still be in the air. But this was a two-year
                    Caribbean vacation. There was absolutely no tension. The people were the nicest
                    people I have ever met at a post. They were very laid back. I joked that they
                    had had their civic sense amputated years before by Trujillo because they gave a
                    high priority to having a party. We enjoyed ourselves immensely.</p>
                <p>I did a lot of independent reporting trying to prove myself as a political
                    officer, as only young men can do. I traveled all over the north, reporting on
                    this and that and, of course, no one really cared. I did get a commendation out
                    of the effort, however. I guess no one had ever gone into some of those little
                    towns. But they were smarter than I, they shouldn't have gone there. There was
                    nothing going on of any interest to the United States at all. But I went there
                    and it was a lot of fun.</p>
                <p>But I knew that I had to get back into economics. So I looked around for
                    economical postings. ARA proposed that I go as economic counselor to Quito. The
                    ambassador there, I forget his name, looked me up and called the Department and
                    said that he had too many kids already and wanted older men. By this time I was
                    32 or 33 and so was disqualified on age.</p>
                <p>At this point Bill Bowdler heard that I was coming on the market and he grabbed
                    me to go to El Salvador. I was chief of the section there for two years.</p>
                <p>This job, together with the one in the Dominican Republic, began to offer me the
                    opportunity to shape programs. I was also assistant director of the AID mission.
                    I began to think seriously about how a mission should function. I became quite
                    interested in being methodical about work programs, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>This was just before the beginning of the Central American crisis, which
                    literally began during my last year in El Salvador.</p>
                <p>Bill Bowdler was assigned to Guatemala and he asked me to go with him. For me the
                    move was attractive because there was a bigger AID program. So I went with Bill
                    to Guatemala.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: This was 1971. I was in El Salvador from 1969-71 and then went to
                    Guatemala, which is right next door you know and literally about 150 miles up
                    the road.</p>
                <p>I went there doing the same job, but a bigger job. Once again we thoroughly
                    enjoyed ourselves. Guatemala is a fabulous country touristically and we had the
                    good fortune of being there between the nasty mindedness of the Guatemalans. The
                    revolution in Guatemala, which began in 1960 with the uprising of Jan Sosa and
                    continues to this day, was in a pause, except for the first nine months we were
                    in Guatemala. During that time we were shepherded around with guards, etc. After
                    that, Sue and I literally traveled over all of the country, taking Embassy
                    4-wheel drive vehicles. It is a beautiful, beautiful country...volcanoes, lakes,
                    Indian culture, colonial towns.</p>
                <p>So I progressed professionally and enjoyed myself. I enjoyed all of my posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that soon after Nat Davis? Did Bowdler succeed Nat
                        Davis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Yes. I am almost certain Bowdler succeeded Nat. Nat was my big daddy in
                    the Foreign Service. You know we have had so many programs in the Foreign
                    Service in which people are always trying to think of ways to do things better
                    and somehow they sort of wither away. When I came into the Service, this is
                    backtracking now, every new officer had a senior mentor assigned to him. Nat was
                    my mentor. That program didn't last long. He was very nice, very helpful.</p>
                <p>So I stayed in Central America six years. By the end of that time, 1975, I had
                    been abroad almost 11 years and that was long enough. The oldest child was 15
                    and it was time to go back to the States. I also wanted senior training. I think
                    I was an “old” FSO- 3 by that time. I don't remember all of my promotion dates,
                    but I must have been a 0-3. I was assigned to the War College.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>So I came back from Guatemala the summer of 1975 to go to the National War
                    College. That, of course, was a great year. Also, if you are going to come back
                    to the States having lived abroad that long, that is a nice introduction. As an
                    aside here, we had not purchased a house before but decided we were going to buy
                    one. I said to my wife, “Sue, why don't you go out and buy a house.” This shows
                    once again my naivete She is about to get on the airplane and a friend of mine
                    from the AID mission said, “That is the dumbest thing you have ever done. You
                    have to make that decision jointly.” So we went up there and bought the house
                    together, which was the way to do it.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we had a year in the War College. During this period Kissinger, a man
                    whose path I crossed subsequently quite a few times, decides, for whatever
                    reason, that everyone had to go some place else. The acronym for that policy was
                    GLOP.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he got the idea that the tribes were too
                        rigidified.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: So here is John Ferch who has only served in Latin America and only by
                    chance. I was not a Latin American specialist on my personnel records. I never
                    did become a Latin American specialist. I just happened to stay in Latin
                    America. But I had to be GLOPED, but I was also going to stay in Washington. So
                    all GLOPING meant to me was not being in ARA, I was going to be in another
                    Bureau. Well I am an economist so obviously I was going to go to EB. Actually
                    this was something I didn't want to do because at that time EB had a policy of
                    keeping people for four years and I didn't want to spend that much time in
                    Washington. But EB wanted me. A woman by the name of Francis Wilson, probably
                    the best executive director the State Department ever had really ran EB. It
                    opened my eyes about ARA. I never realized that ARA was so sloppily run as it
                    was until I saw a Bureau like EB. Jules Katz was the Assistant Secretary then, a
                    fabulous guy. EB really opened my eyes about management.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I was made an office director in EB, something called Food Policies and
                    Programs, which was PL 480 and a lot of other things. Basically it was liaison
                    office with the Department of Agriculture because State has little
                    responsibility for international agriculture. What we had was vested in my
                    office, a fairly large office. We must have had six to ten people.</p>
                <p>I was there for two years and I really began to appreciate what Francis was and
                    is, but I still wanted to go overseas. I must have done a pretty good job
                    because Francis did not hold me to the four year rule. And more than that she
                    was instrumental in obtaining for me one of my best assignments. By this time,
                    having been an office director, I said that I was ready for a big DCMship. Once
                    again naivete. So I started talking around.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Pat Lucy was ambassador in Mexico. He had been Kennedy's campaign manager and
                    also governor of Wisconsin. He wanted a new DCM and called a friend of his in
                    Treasury, Tony Soloman, I think. Soloman called Francis Wilson to see if she
                    could recommend someone for the DCM slot. She gave him my name and I went over
                    and talked to Pat. He said, “I want you.” Then the Department said that he
                    couldn't take a guy of my rank to Mexico. I was at that time still a 0-3 and 41.
                    He said, “Okay” and chose somebody else. And then that somebody else quit the
                    Service. Pat again said that he wanted Ferch, that he wasn't going to put up
                    with anymore of this. So I went to Mexico. I had been assigned to go as DCM to
                    Quito. I was in the DCM course when I was told I was going to go to Mexico,
                    which, of course, was a tremendous step up.</p>
                <p>At that time it was the largest mission in the Foreign Service. We had 1200
                    people and a hand full of consulates. I spent four years there. A fabulous job.
                    I really conceived of that job and carried it out as I think a DCM job should be
                    conceived—an in-house job, managing the embassy, making it function. I had an
                    opportunity to put into practice all sorts of ideas I had about really making
                    reporting programs relate to policy and having reporting assignments reflected
                    in the goals and objectives and officers' efficiency reports. I really got into
                    trying to run a coherent embassy.</p>
                <p>I worked for three ambassadors, three political appointees. Pat Lucy was the
                    first one. He quit to run Ted Kennedy's campaign. Pat is still a very, very good
                    friend of mine who I highly admire. Then there was a man by the name of Julian
                    Nava who served only 11 months. He tested me no end because he did such things
                    as bringing in a Rolls Royce and selling it before he even sat in it, for
                    $100,000. The Inspector General finally came down and he left for that reason,
                    but most people didn't know that because it was also the change of
                    administration. Then John Gavin came down and I worked for him until I left.</p>
                <p>So I was there in Mexico from 1978-82. At one time towards the end, my name,
                    although I am not sure how far along it was, was on the ambassadorial list for
                    the DR, which really pleased me. The Ambassador, this was John Gavin, who by the
                    way has a profound, extraordinary knowledge of Mexico and his Spanish was better
                    than any Spanish I have ever heard, had a secretary who he wanted removed. John
                    Ferch, the naive, who was focusing on the management of the Embassy, said that
                    that was the DCM's job. She was a young black woman and brought a grievance
                    against me, which did not hold. I was not charged with anything but doing my
                    job. But during the course of the grievance, my name was removed from whatever
                    stage it was re going to the DR. I was not too happy about that, as you can
                    imagine. But Jack Gavin felt he had to help me out.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Because of his intervention I was called one day and asked if I would like to go
                    to Cuba as chief of mission there? We don't have an embassy in Havana, we have
                    an equivalent of an embassy, an Interests Section. I was totally surprised
                    because Cuba is a communist country and I had never served in that environment
                    at all and hadn't followed Castro's revolution. What I also realized at that
                    time was that I couldn't say no. I was, however, concerned about my lack of
                    experience in communist societies.</p>
                <p>So I went to Cuba and spent three years there. I was on the island during the
                    invasion of Grenada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you pause here for a while and describe exactly what
                        your function was in Cuba and what you were able to do and not do and what
                        officials you saw or didn't see, etc.? Give us a picture of what it was like
                        to be in that hostile environment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: I was going to do that under the issues segment, but I will do it here if
                    you like.</p>
                <p>First of all, the Interests Sections were established in 1977 by an exchange of
                    Notes, very brief Notes, that limited their size, but also said they would be
                    treated as if they were embassies and the chief of the section would be treated
                    as if he were an ambassador. And the Cubans lived up to that. I was the American
                    Ambassador in Cuba and dealt as any other ambassador. Now, having said that, our
                    work load was different in Cuba than other American embassies around the world
                    because of the hostile relationship with the Cubans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that mean that you could trot down to the Foreign
                        Office and be received at a reasonably high level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Absolutely. In fact, it was rather strange. Let me walk through this a
                    bit. It took me some time to realize what the situation was there it was
                    different than, I am sure, any other diplomatic mission we then had—it may not
                    be true now. But then Castro wanted effective contact with the United States. I
                    use the word effective advisedly. He wanted to be able to communicate quickly
                    with us. And he wanted to be able to have us communicate with him. He could not
                    do that through Washington because we never honored that exchange of Notes. We
                    do not treat the chief of the Cuban Interest Section here as if he were an
                    ambassador. He is not invited to regular diplomatic events. He does not have
                    access. I was the third chief of the Interest Section and our practice was well
                    established. So Castro knew that if he was going to have effective communication
                    with the US Government, it was going to be through the Interest Section in
                    Havana, through me.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Prior to my arrival he designated in an informal but clear manner, a handful of
                    men to deal with the chief of the Section. The senior of these men, was a man by
                    the name of Jose Luis Padron, who was in their DGI, intelligence organization,
                    but had the open job of head of tourism. He was an old personal friend of
                    Castro...a very intelligent, a very personable man. In addition to him there was
                    the now Ambassador to the UN, Ricardo Alarcon. He was then senior vice minister
                    in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. There was Jose Antonio Arbreu, who is now
                    chief of the Cuban Interest Section here. He worked with Piniero “Barba Roja”,
                    in the Americas Department in the Party. The Americas Department is the group
                    that managed and supplied the guerrilla movements around Latin America. And
                    there was the Foreign Policy Adviser to the Vice President, Rafael Rodriguez, an
                    old line communist. This man's name was Salsiminde.</p>
                <p>These people, with the exception of the latter (Salsiminde and I didn't hit it
                    off well, I think for personal reasons) met with me frequently. I had very high
                    regard for those other three men. And still do. They were very bright guys,
                    professional. Through them I could reach Castro probably quicker than anybody in
                    town.</p>
                <p>To give an example, during the first day of our invasion of Grenada, I had a
                    prearranged call on Jose Luis Padron. I used the visit to reiterate, under
                    Washington instructions, the thrust of our Note which I had delivered earlier to
                    Alarcon. The thrust of that note was that the Cubans on Grenada were not the
                    target and if they laid down their arms they could leave honorably. Padron picks
                    up the phone and calls Castro right on the spot. That is the type of contact I
                    could have.</p>
                <p>What is interesting about this is that that was the only contact I got. I
                    couldn't do other things that a mission would normally engage in. Say dealing
                    with the Minister of Commerce, the Minister of Culture, etc. Castro wanted the
                    substance of diplomatic relations but didn't want the appearance of friendly
                    relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did not see Castro himself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Oh, several times, but not in personal conversation. I could not call up
                    Castro and get an appointment. It was always in the context of other events in
                    which he arranged to see me. I had lengthy conversations with him several times,
                    but it was at his doing rather than my doing. My contact, when I wanted to reach
                    him, was through these men.</p>
                <p>But the point is that I didn't have much else to do in the sense of...you want to
                    do a fishery report? Call the Ministry of Fisheries. No, I couldn't do that. It
                    would give the appearance of normality and they didn't want that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much of a staff did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>FERCH: It was limited by the Note. However, both the Cubans and ourselves,
                    circumvented the Note by bringing in TDY people. We were not supposed to have
                    more than 20 some people. At any one time, I suppose, we had 30 to 35 Americans,
                    including eight marines. Then, of course, being Americans, we had to have a
                    large local staff. Think of this, here is the government we love to hate most
                    and we hired 100 Cubans. They were running all over the place. We were not going
                    to drive ourselves, or paint our own houses. So we had this tremendous staff to
                    maintain our presence there. I always found that rather amusing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, the rest of your staff were they doing substantive
                        reporting also?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Well, there were four or five people doing substantive reporting with a
                    couple of secretaries. It wasn't much. The real work of the Section was done by
                    me because the real work was done through those four men and myself. The end
                    result of this was ironic. You frequently hear people say, “Boy, I wish I had
                    time to think. Wish I had time to sit back and plot my course, but I can't
                    because I am too busy.” Well, I wasn't that busy and I had time to think about
                    what the Cubans were up to or what Castro was doing. I would sit in my office
                    overlooking the water and El Moro Castle and ponder the entrails of the Cuban
                    mystery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the old embassy that we were still using?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Oh yes. (And I lived in the Residence. The finest Residence I have ever
                    seen in the Foreign Service.) In this manner I taught myself how to analyze
                    communist newspapers by what is not in them. You keep up to date on world events
                    and then you compare with what they are not saying with what is actually going
                    on. I was very proud of it. It was one of the most intellectually satisfying
                    times I ever had. It was almost like puzzle breaking. As a result of this I
                    think they respected me. They could see that I was understanding what was going
                    on. Those societies are so opaque. They create all these barriers between anyone
                    and them. And I was able to break the barrier because of the time they gave
                    me.</p>
                <p>For example, I was able to alert Washington to such things as a Cuban about face
                    on Angola. To me it was very clear at one point that the Cubans were taken aback
                    by Assistant Secretary Crocker's success in his negotiations with the Angolans
                    and wanted to come on board. I was able to alert Washington to that and
                    negotiations resulted.</p>
                <p>I should note that they did allow me to visit factories, which I never could
                    understand because they displayed how inefficient they were Cuba was very
                    interesting. I could go on talking about Cuba for hours. It was fascinating.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Cuba also provided us with a fascinating personal note. When Sue and I went to
                    Argentina in 1959 we stayed in a hotel called the Crillon on the Plaza San
                    Martin.</p>
                <p>I was simply going to say that there was a neat completion of the circle,
                    personally for Sue and myself in the Cuban assignment. Cuba was a very
                    satisfying assignment intellectually. A very difficult assignment because you
                    were always on your guard. The Cuban officials I dealt with were super sharp
                    individuals. I never thought I could relax with them as you can in most places
                    in Latin America where you can become friends. The Cubans I dealt with were very
                    good acquaintances. They were very personable. They never mistreated me. They
                    treated me with respect. I treated them with respect. We got along, we laughed,
                    but you never let your guard down.</p>
                <p>So every time we left Cuba, and we left frequently because of the pressure of
                    always being on stage, I felt, I used to tell people, 20 pounds lighter when I
                    got off the plane in Miami.</p>
                <p>The completion of the circle that I was talking about before...when Sue and I
                    went to Argentina in 1959 to begin our career we stayed in the Hotel Crillon on
                    the Plaza San Martin. For people who know BA they will know exactly what I am
                    talking about—a lovely place. Castro, Che Guevara and a whole crew of people
                    were also staying there. I have this image in my mind...Sue and I are going out
                    to dinner one night, we were at the hotel for three months before we found a
                    house, and Fidel and Che were coming through the door. That was my first contact
                    with Cuba and there were no other contact for years and years and then I get
                    assigned to Havana near the end of my career. So it was kind of a full
                    circle.</p>
                <p>At the risk of getting off on a tangent, let me say something about the invasion
                    of Grenada because this illustrates something very interesting about our
                    relations and the Cuban people's relations to Castro.</p>
                <p>I had not been told that the invasion was pending. Apparently the Cubans saw it
                    coming and for reasons I don't understand...perhaps it was coincidental...our
                    communications were cut. Power was down and it was very difficult for me to
                    cable Washington on Saturday...the invasion was on a Tuesday morning. On Tuesday
                    morning I was awakened by a call from Washington because they could not send a
                    message on the regular facilities. They read me a diplomatic Note to be given to
                    the Cubans. I wrote it down and rushed to the Embassy, translated it and had it
                    typed up, and delivered it to Ricardo Alarcon at 8:30 that morning, as I
                    mentioned earlier.</p>
                <p>The Note was the first of many. It was very interesting to me because it was
                    almost out of the 19th century. It said something like, “You, Cuba, are not the
                    target. Your soldiers can lay down their arms but keep their side arms, flags
                    and depart with honor.” It was really right out of another century.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>As I said, I had a call scheduled on Padron at 10:00 that day and kept it
                    obviously. I was told by Washington to go in and repeat the message orally. So I
                    made the demarche orally. He called Castro on the phone at that time and said,
                    “This is what Ferch is saying.” Castro said...and I never figured out whether
                    Castro had been deceived or not...he said, “Tell Ferch he is behind the times.
                    All of our men died fighting. The last of them wrapped themselves in the flag
                    and died fighting.” Well that wasn't true, of course. But that was what Castro's
                    message to me was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were none of them killed were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: There were 22 or 23 killed.</p>
                <p>From that point on for the next two weeks there were many messages. The Grenada
                    invasion for us in Cuba lasted until the bodies and the troops came home. There
                    was a lot of diplomatic correspondence. During the first part of those two
                    weeks, the level of tension in Cuba was very, very high. I say level of tension
                    in the sense they didn't know what we were going to do and the people of Cuba
                    were very, very worried that war was going to come to them. During this period,
                    no one picked up the phone and made a nasty call to us, much less demonstrated
                    in front of the Interest Section, must less threw a stone at anyone, nothing. It
                    was a controlled society, but it says something about the Cuban people, they
                    can't control everyone all of the time. The people were worried.</p>
                <p>What I am leading up to is the following. Castro tried to calm down this concern
                    and he was unsuccessful. Therefore, this is my own interpretation, on the second
                    day there appeared in the upper left hand corner of the Party newspaper a little
                    box headlined, “Advise to the Public.” This box appeared subsequently after
                    every demarche I made, every Note I delivered. It began, “Mr. Ferch has the
                    following to say.” And it reported correctly in every case without changing
                    words at all.</p>
                <p>The conclusion that I reach from that, and I don't think the conclusion has been
                    properly drawn by anyone else, is that it demonstrates that the Cuban Government
                    lacked credibility in the eyes of the Cuban people and that the only way Castro
                    could get the message across to calm down, that there would be no war, was to
                    let it come through the words of the US representative. I had more credibility
                    in the public eyes than he did. I think that was the lesson there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your liaison and communications with Washington what
                        was your channel? Who did you really communicate with—Desk or higher?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>FERCH: Obviously, like any ambassador, I communicated on various levels. On a
                    daily basis I would talk to Ken Skous who was the coordinator for Cuban Affairs,
                    effectively the Country Director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By telephone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: By telephone and by cable. I did most of the reporting there so I was
                    communicating with a lot of people. I must say now on my current job with the
                    National Intelligence Council I find a lot of people who seem to remember my
                    reporting. Everybody was interested in Cuba so my reporting was widely read.</p>
                <p>When I would go to Washington I would see the Assistant Secretary. Before going
                    to Cuba, Larry Eagleburger called me in and gave me a message for Castro to get
                    me off to a good start. The message said something to the effect that we too
                    wanted effective relations.</p>
                <p>I saw George Shultz several times during the course of the three years because of
                    certain events that he wanted to know more about.</p>
                <p>So the level of contact was up to the very top of the Department, which is true
                    of most ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during Mariel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: No, Wayne Smith, my predecessor, was there during Mariel. That was 1980, I
                    came in 1982. People in the Section who had been there during Mariel were still
                    there. That was a very difficult time for the Section because many Cubans fled
                    to the Section—40, 50, maybe even more—and couldn't leave for months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Came over the fence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Well, there was no fence. They just came into the building. We had one
                    person come in while I was there and it was months before we could get her out.
                    A middle aged American woman who married this Cuban kid of 18. She came into the
                    Section and asked to bring her husband in. Not thinking, the guard said, “Sure.”
                    Once he was in she refused to leave. She was trying to get him out of the
                    country. It eventually worked.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I was in Cuba for three years and it was the most intellectually
                    satisfying assignment I ever had. I got Cuba in my blood, a beautiful country,
                    great people. My kids at this time were almost grown. They also loved
                    Havana.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: No, they were all in school, but would come down for vacations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your wife was with you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Oh yes. The children loved Cuba and were able to really get around,
                    especially my son who was at St. Albans. They are all bilingual, bicultural.
                    They would go back to Cuba in an instant if Cuba opened up.</p>
                <p>I approached Cuba as a non-ideologue. I didn't like what I saw there. Sue and I
                    were greatly upset by what we saw there. How Castro in effect tried to change
                    the Latin character. I could go into that if you are interested, but that is not
                    about me. We did not appreciate what we saw. I am, on the political scale,
                    extremely liberal. I believe in change, experiment politically, but I didn't
                    like what I saw there. I didn't like the fact that when you sent out invitations
                    to dinner for 7:30, everybody was there at 7:30. I am not being facetious. I
                    didn't like the fact that everybody obeyed the speed limit. That is not Latin.
                    No one blew their horn.</p>
                <p>I had a lot of visitors, a lot of personal friends came to visit me. They did so
                    because it was a fascinating place and being in Cuba the Cuban Government as a
                    courtesy to me would give visas to these private people. The US Government would
                    arrange permits for them to visit us. Personal friends, from Mexico, primarily,
                    came over to visit us. I mention this because I would tell all of them to walk
                    through the heart of Havana. They all had the same observation afterwards...how
                    quiet it was. Obviously there was nothing on the shelves, but they knew that.
                    But they would comment on the lack of noise. No one is yelling. Now Latin
                    societies are loud and that is not so in Cuba. That is bad. This is an
                    indication, small, but a revealing indication of how this guy has tried to
                    change the character and successfully so. Well, I shouldn't say successfully,
                    but at least they have bowed to what he wants. So Sue and I did not like what we
                    saw there. It will be a better country afterwards. It may be more chaotic and
                    may be less egalitarian. I certainly am an egalitarian, but less equality and
                    more openness is certainly a good trade-off in this case.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Anyway towards the end of my third year in Cuba I began to look for an
                    assignment. Now my aspiration was for another mission, but this time with a
                    title. One day Tony Motley called up and asked if I would like to go to Colombia
                    as ambassador. He wanted an honest answer. Going to Colombia with the drug
                    situation meant that my kids could never visit, and everyone in the Embassy
                    there lives in a very constrained world. I thought about it and said, “Yes.”
                    Later he called me back and said he was changing the assignment if I didn't
                    mind. They were going to send me to Honduras. The guy who was going to go to
                    Honduras had trouble with the White House and they had to shuffle people
                    around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are now in which year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Early 1985. So I went to Honduras. That is where my career ended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you contacted Abrams at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: No, Tony Motley was the Assistant Secretary. He was removed, I think in
                    June, once again over disagreements with the management of our Central American
                    policy. It was in the press at the time. My last conversation with Tony was when
                    I came out of Cuba, not the final time, but the President of Honduras was coming
                    up for a visit here in May or June and they brought me up from Cuba. I will
                    never forget my last official interview with him. He said, about going to
                    Honduras and what was going on down there, “John, always remember you are
                    playing with other peoples' lives down there. [Meaning that we are not putting
                    our troops on the line, we are putting Central Americans on the line.] That is a
                    tremendous responsibility and be careful and don't treat it lightly.” I was very
                    impressed by that.</p>
                <p>Anyway I went back to Cuba, came out in mid summer, and went through the
                    confirmation process. Jesse Helms held me up for a long time. He didn't like
                    anyone who had anything to do with Cuba. I was suspect. In August, Sue and I
                    flew down to Tegucigalpa.Before flying down, while in Washington preparing to go
                    down, I saw a lot of people, got briefed, etc. Elliott Abrams was by then the
                    new Assistant Secretary for ARA. He called me in and asked me to be his Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary for Central America, to not go to Honduras. I had been asked
                    by Tom Enders to do that job before when I was in Mexico. I had turned him down.
                    I didn't want to get involved in the mess in Central America, especially at the
                    Washington end, a highly politicized end.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>So when Elliott asked me I also turned him down. I said to him more or less this,
                    “Elliott, my strengths are in the field, but they are good strengths. I really
                    know how to run a mission and deal with Latins. I guarantee you that I can deal
                    with Honduras in a way that ensures the Honduran Government will support our
                    policy. The Hondurans had been very difficult, on and off. They are a very
                    unsure people. Our problem is that we have been acting like Pro Consuls down
                    there, and that day and age is passed. My plan is to go down there and focus
                    publicly on Honduran problems through our Peace Corps, through our AID program,
                    and, if you let me do that, I guarantee you that the Honduran Government will
                    support us in matters that concern us.”</p>
                <p>He didn't dispute me or anything. He just let that go. But it is interesting in
                    light of what was about to happen to me down there, because it was not what he
                    wanted to hear. This has only come out in retrospect. This was just when the
                    secret program was beginning in Central America. This was when the airstrip was
                    just being built in Costa Rica. On the way down to Tegucigalpa, I stopped off in
                    Panama because of a Chiefs of Mission meeting there. We were standing in the
                    corridor and Lewis Tambs, our Ambassador to Costa Rica, asked Elliott about the
                    airstrip. Why I remember this, I don't know. Elliott said something about the
                    status of it. Both of them understood, but I didn't know what they were talking
                    about. Then Elliott realized he was talking in front of a group of us and went
                    off in the corner to talk with Tambs about the airstrip. Elliott was already
                    involved in what was to become the Ollie North secret supply operation.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I am in Honduras and get started organizing the Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You arrive what month?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: August, 1985. I didn't last a full year. I left in July, 1986.</p>
                <p>Here you have a career that went from early 1959 to mid 1986, all in Latin
                    American Affairs, except for that one tour in EB. I stayed in the Service
                    afterwards for a couple of years until I decided to retire. There was no where
                    to go. I saw that the new White House was not going to give me a mission. I was
                    involved during this time, 1959-86, 27 years, at very senior and very junior
                    levels. Deeply involved with Alliance for Progress in Colombia, El Salvador and
                    Guatemala. I saw what could be achieved with development assistance. I think the
                    Alliance was a success. Growth rates were raised. Infrastructure was built. We
                    were lax in that we didn't insist on a political element. We allowed crummy
                    governments to get away with repression. Anyway, I was involved in development
                    assistance. I was involved in the aftermath of the intervention in the DR.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>In Central America I was literally involved at the beginning and at the end of
                    the crisis. When I was in El Salvador the FLMN made their first kidnapping. And
                    I say I am involved because the man they kidnapped, Ernesto Regaledo, had in his
                    wallet, my calling card. So when the guerrillas sent in the note to the family
                    asking for the money, they enclosed the calling cards found in his wallet,
                    calling them his “Amigitos y Co-magnates”, “little friends and co- magnates,
                    beginning with John Arthur Ferch.” At the time I didn't think it was too funny.
                    So I was involved in the beginning of the Central American crisis and then went
                    to Honduras and was involved with the Contras.</p>
                <p>I was also involved in Mexico during the height of the petroleumboom, the years
                    of Lopez Portillo, when the Mexicans thought they had the world by the tail. In
                    effect they only pulled their own tail over the edge. I was there when they fell
                    over the edge in 1982 and was able to say to many American bankers that this was
                    the dance of the millions, turn around and get on an airplane and get out of
                    here. This isn't going to last. The run up to the debt crisis. I saw it coming.
                    I told people it was coming.</p>
                <p>I was involved in Cuba. Fidel Castro, the man American Presidents loved to
                    hate.</p>
                <p>All in all, I was involved in all of the issues that ripped Latin American policy
                    during those years. I knew many of the men who were involved in it. Bill
                    Bowdler, a man of tremendous intellectual stature, shaped our policy for a long
                    time. Pete Vaky Never worked with Pete but always had indirect contact with him.
                    Covey Oliver was a great ambassador.</p>
                <p>On looking back I think I was involved in almost all of the major elements of our
                    Latin American policy during the course of those years.</p>
                <p>What do I draw from it? That for reasons that have something to do with the
                    American political scene, not the Latin scene, we have consistently elevated
                    Latin America to a level of importance far beyond what it merits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always thought the Latinos felt they were being
                        ignored.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>FERCH: They may have felt that way but it is not so. Where else did we have an
                    Alliance for Progress? Why did we have an Alliance for Progress? Why did we
                    focus on that? Because we somehow felt that Latin America was going to fall to
                    the commies and we had to fight back against Fidel. As if the Latins were not
                    capable of defending themselves. We never understood how little Latin America
                    affects US interests. I say this frequently now that I work on international
                    economic issues. Seventy-five percent of world GNP is found in North America,
                    the EC and the vibrant East Asian economies. Twenty-five percent covers every
                    place else. Latin America's share of world GNP is under 10 percent. Latin
                    America doesn't matter economically, it doesn't affect us. Except for Mexico,
                    basically we are not altered by what happens in Latin America. I love Latin
                    America. I gave my career to it and I don't regret a day of it. I enjoyed every
                    minute of it. But it is not that important. This is the conclusion of what I
                    draw from my experience in Latin America, and having been a player in elevating
                    it to extreme levels of importance. We erred. It wasn't that important. It
                    certainly didn't deserve our obsession. It probably didn't deserve the Alliance
                    for Progress. Our tax payers money was doing what? Latins benefited, but we
                    didn't do the same thing in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But isn't Brazil a little bit of a departure from that
                        assessment—in terms of size and weight?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: No. Let me quote something that is always quoted. “Brazil is the country
                    of the future and always will be.” Latin America is economically small. Latin
                    America politically is out of the mainstream. Latin America does not threaten us
                    militarily, it never has and never could. The Russians could never threaten us
                    militarily from Latin America. Furthermore Latin Americans can defend
                    themselves. Why did we fear that Latin America would become a red spot on the
                    map?</p>
                <p>Anyway, that is my conclusion from having supported myself by supporting our
                    policies, and I supported them willingly. This is not Monday morning
                    quarterbacking, it is middle-age quarterbacking thinking that maybe we fell into
                    something. But it wasn't just during those 27 years that we did it. If you look
                    back at the rogues gallery of the Assistant Secretaries in the conference room
                    of ARA you will see that the tour life of those Secretaries is very short,
                    reflecting the political intensity of Latin-US relations.</p>
                <p>Why that should be is something else. It is a much more political bureau than any
                    other. The focus on Latin American relations is more politicized in the United
                    States than say the focus on European nations. There are people up in Congress
                    who feel strongly about this. Jesse Helms feels strongly about it. People scream
                    and shout over El Salvador. El Salvador is 120 miles long by 40 miles
                    wide...really!</p>
                <p>Anyway, like Israel, it is a highly politicized issue. It has always been too
                    politicized in our mind. It is not just during the 27 years I worked the issue.
                    But that is what I have come away with.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other thing that emerges from your account is the
                        tremendous working of the tribal system that you, who lived through...here
                        this small group of people over decades interrelated, helped you with your
                        assignments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Oh, well lets come back to that because that is a comment on the
                    Service.</p>
                <p>I would like to offer a few comments on management in the Foreign Service. And I
                    don't mean administration, which we also do fairly poorly. I always felt, and I
                    think rightly so, that senior mission officers don't try to create a viable work
                    plan. They kind of stumbled through life, going from one issue to another
                    without thinking about where they were going. That's too grossly stated, I fully
                    appreciate that. But to illustrate this thought, when George Shultz was
                    Secretary he always wanted people to think of their goals and objectives as they
                    related to US interests, and to spell them out. Then, not only write them up in
                    a comprehensive way so that everyone in the mission would be part of it, this
                    was what they were going to try to do, but go back again and measure them. See
                    whether you were doing what you said you were going to do.</p>
                <p>I always treated that task seriously when I was in Mexico, Cuba and Honduras. And
                    I suspect that very few other people did. I say that because I would insist that
                    we not only go through the exercise in which each segment of the mission would
                    take part, but would insist that we go back and look at results. I would meet
                    with them every quarter. As a result of each meeting, review where they were and
                    write up briefly how I thought they were progressing towards their goals. On the
                    reporting side of things I would actually have my secretary keep a list of
                    planned reports and whether or not they were done on time. I would send little
                    notes to remind them. Then once every quarter or so I would send a report into
                    Washington. I would get no response from Washington. No one really cared whether
                    the mission was actually, continuously working towards its stated goals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The end users in Washington are a lot of sectors who have
                        very narrow interests and I don't think there is anybody who is interested
                        in the overall efforts of the operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Well, the Assistant Secretary should be.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>FERCH: You know, all the embassies had country plans, Bill. I am saying that I
                    didn't see them being treated seriously before I got to a senior level. And when
                    I was there and tried to treat them seriously, I didn't sense that Washington
                    really cared. I really fault the State Department for not being more serious in
                    its approach to planning, especially at the mission level. It is too much for a
                    Bureau to be engaged in this, but certainly a mission can. It isn't enough to
                    write a plan, you have to be rigorous in following that plan and you have to be
                    willing to drop part of it if circumstances change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The inspection is one moment when somebody from outside is
                        interested in the overall performance, and whether it is consonant with
                        policy and whether the resources are in reasonable step with the objectives
                        and priorities. At least when I was doing it. I did it for three years. This
                        was a major focus of the inspection.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: It should be. How many missions did you find were rigorous in following
                    their own objectives?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I thought fairly few.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Let me say also in the management area, something that I found very
                    satisfying. I found management satisfying. I found it intellectually
                    challenging. But there is another aspect to that. I found the management of
                    personnel development extraordinarily satisfying. The place where I have the
                    fondest memories was in Mexico. Mexico, because of the consular workload, had an
                    inordinately large number of junior officers. I would say that at any one time
                    we probably had 25 to 40 junior officers...the visa mills. I, as DCM, was
                    responsible for the development of these officers. I enjoyed that. I met
                    everyone who came in. Every quarter I was suppose to write something on them so
                    I would take them out to lunch, talk to them, find out how they were doing.
                    Every month I would have a group of them over to my house and we would talk
                    about the career and functioning in the Foreign Service. I found it very, very
                    satisfying. I left Mexico in 1982. Many of those people are now really quite
                    successful in the Foreign Service. Looking back like that you can see they are
                    not successful because of me, but I had a hand in it.Let me say something about
                    wives in the Foreign Service. This is a fairly old problem but I would like to
                    focus on it from my personal angle.</p>
                <p>As I have related, all of my career has been in substantive work. By that I mean
                    in work where I had to relate to foreigners and wanted something from them,
                    information largely. And I was overseas most of my career. This meant that my
                    need to relate to foreigners effectively was great and extended throughout most
                    of my career. If you are in Washington that is less so. And if you are a
                    consular officer, it is less so.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Now, I couldn't have done it without a wife who was a full-time Foreign Service
                    wife, who viewed herself as such. Who saw the job conscientiously and
                    intellectually. Who ended up managing huge residences with staffs of 10 or 20
                    and entertaining two or three times a week. Who handled that all by herself. And
                    who started as a young woman of 21 scared out of her mind doing things like that
                    in Argentina. We didn't entertain much then. I remember my first representation
                    allowance was $50 and I didn't want to take it, I didn't want to entertain at
                    all. But we learned. For many years we traveled up and down Latin America with
                    dinnerware for seating 100. And we did it. We did it frequently and it was work
                    and done well. And it was all her doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she enjoy it while she was going along?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: She learned to enjoy it. First of all it was a job. This was no less
                    difficult than me going to the office and thinking about the balance of payments
                    with Colombia. It was the same type of job. She, just as I enjoyed my work,
                    became a professional at that and enjoyed it that way. Not because it was fun to
                    entertain, it was a job that required a professional approach and she became
                    professional at it just as I became professional on my side of the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>I might say in an aside, we built a cottage beginning in 1986 in northern
                    Ontario. We are the only people on the lake, a little spur of the lake. We
                    literally built it with our own hands. It is now equipped with all the leftover
                    dinnerware and glasses.</p>
                <p>My point here is that without her I couldn't have done what I did. I wouldn't
                    have had the contacts, the intimate relationships with contacts that I did
                    develop in every country. That was her doing. She furthered US interests
                    certainly as much I did.</p>
                <p>Now, during the course of those years, women's ambitions changed. My wife went
                    Ohio University...a school teacher, who has only taught a couple of years. But
                    basically graduating in 1958 her aspirations were shaped by the times and she
                    didn't feel that need that women now do to be an architect, lawyer, etc. So she
                    was not burdened in the Foreign Service with that frustration of not being able
                    to do what you wanted to do. Women now are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My wife was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Was she?</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Women now do not want to do this. At least very few want to do it. I had a great
                    deal of trouble in Honduras getting people to engage in representation. They
                    basically said, “You do it.” That wasn't true in Mexico, the senior officers
                    there were of my generation. But the younger officers, perhaps just 15 years
                    younger than my self...their wives didn't want to do this. And I don't know what
                    the Service does about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, I am going to interject here because it is very
                        pertinent. Society has passed the time in many areas where this is possible
                        anymore. In Europe, for example, the representational allowances will pay
                        for one lousy dinner a year. This means that if the younger officers are
                        going to be doing this, the wife will physically be cutting the canapes two
                        or three days before the party, without a staff to do it. When we entered
                        the Service in Italy just after the war, we did this kind of thing
                        appropriate to our level, but we had the servants. They don't have the
                        servants anymore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Oh, I understand it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were still operating in the old marvelous Foreign
                        Service regime.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: I am fully aware of that. I am simply saying that I don't know what the
                    Service can do, probably nothing, but it wasn't just something you enjoyed. The
                    Service got results from that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand. But there is another anomaly of this and
                        that is that the Service still judges officers by the kind of production
                        that that old representational effort produced. But in a lot of countries
                        you can't have that kind of representation, so the officers are torn. They
                        are struggling to keep up with the old criteria when they do not have the
                        tools to do the job anymore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: That is unfortunate. I don't know what you do. I just mention the fact
                    that I have always admired what my wife did. And I must say, just as women now
                    overseas are frustrated that they can't pursue their careers, my wife, now that
                    we have left the Service, is very frustrated too. She trained to be a senior
                    wife and assumed she would be at that level and doing this for a decade. She now
                    ironically, can't pursue her profession, which was the Foreign Service, and is
                    really quite frustrated by this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My wife is the other way around. At almost every post she
                        would make the initial steps for some sort of separate functional career and
                        would be cut off when we left. So when we finally came back to Washington,
                        and had several years here, she got a job on the Hill. She now has a career
                        going in labor and is very happy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>FERCH: She probably is the norm now. But it was different at one time and I think
                    the Service has lost something.</p>
                <p>Let me switch now to how my career ended, because it will lead to the final
                    conclusion of this interview, what I think is good in the Foreign Service and
                    what I think is bad.</p>
                <p>I went to Honduras in August, 1985. Coincidentally, Oliver North, Elliott Abrams
                    and other people were just beginning the illegal program of supporting the
                    Contras. We were at that time operating under the Bohlen Amendment which has
                    been amply discussed everywhere, which at that time (it had several
                    incarnations) allowed us only to accept intelligence from the Contras. We could
                    relate to the Contras and hear what they had to say about troop movements, etc.,
                    but we didn't plan their war, we didn't supply them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now was this all absolutely clear to you in the
                        field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: You mean before I went down?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, before you went down and when you went down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Just before I went down Congress approved a package of $27 million for
                    so-called humanitarian assistance, non-lethal assistance. The Contras could use
                    that to buy beans, shoes, and things like that. The modalities of that had not
                    been worked out.</p>
                <p>I was not told, “John this is what you can and should do with the Contras, this
                    is what you can't do.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who would have told you that if somebody had told you
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Elliott Abrams. But remember he at this time was also participating with
                    North and working up something that became known as the “Enterprise”, or
                    whatever they called it. He did not tell me, nor did anyone else. I was partly
                    to blame here. If I had not been so naive as I had been all through my career in
                    areas that were less important, I would have demanded in writing up front before
                    I went down there what is my responsibility. As it was I went down there
                    thinking that my responsibility was to keep my hands off the Contras in every
                    way, shape and form and that the Station Chief would perform the function of
                    taking their information. I could meet them but I understood I had no reason to
                    meet them. I understood that I had no operational role towards the Contras.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the NSC or the White House
                        staff before you went down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: I was told before going down to go and call on Ollie North, which I did. I
                    didn't know who North was. I went over there and Fawn Hall was there, Ollie was
                    late. We talked and then Ollie came and went into his office. You could not fail
                    to observe Fawn Hall. So I said something and Ollie said, “Yes, and she can type
                    too.” It turned out she could also shred. Anyway we had a chat. I didn't know
                    why I was calling on this guy. It was all very vague why I was supposed to meet
                    him. We didn't talk about much of anything. He said something to the effect that
                    he was the man responsible for the Contras in the US Government. I will never
                    forget because in the context of that part of the conversation he said, “And I
                    am walking very close to the edge of the law.” Now I thought it was unusual for
                    him to tell a stranger something like that. Anyway, there was nothing else.</p>
                <p>So I go down there to Honduras. I had that conversation with Abrams saying I was
                    going to build up an image, change the Pro Consul image of the mission, and I
                    set about consciously to do that. We visited Peace Corps projects, AID projects,
                    got involved in things like that and made sure that our PAO was getting it into
                    the papers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask another question, had you wanted to do so could
                        the legal boys have given you a sort of legal officers view of what was
                        permitted under the law?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: I certainly wish now that I had done that. I was not smart enough to do
                    that. Whether they could give me that, I can't answer, because I didn't try. I
                    didn't realize, you see, how important the “open” Contra program was and
                    certainly didn't understand anything of how important this “covert” Contra
                    program was. I didn't realize it was the center of our policy in Central
                    America. I thought, for instance, that our involvement in Honduras, we had a
                    military base there in Palmarola of about 1500 people at any one time, was
                    primarily there to support our effort in El Salvador. We were doing a lot of
                    things that were supportive of the Salvadoran armed forces from the base in
                    Honduras.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the country director was unaware of these
                        distinctions also? He could have given you guidance I should think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: He could have. He didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think he knew what was legal and what wasn't,
                        etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>FERCH: I don't know. I can't answer that. And once again, I didn't put him on the
                    spot. He didn't volunteer anything to me. This is my fault that I didn't sense
                    that here was something so sensitive and so important. But bear in mind that I
                    was totally unaware until well after the fact that there was a secret part to
                    this program. Dealing with the open part where you have a liaison function, it
                    didn't seem that complicated to me. Then, as I said, the humanitarian assistance
                    had just been approved. The modalities had not been worked out and I didn't know
                    what my relations to that would be, but I assumed I would be told once the
                    modalities were worked out. There was no reason to pin anyone down on that at
                    the moment because they couldn't be pinned down. And initially when the
                    modalities were worked out it was that the Contras bought the goods in the
                    States and on their own were to get the stuff down to Honduras. So we, the
                    mission, had no involvement with the Contras taking the goods that they bought
                    using our money down to Honduras. So I was not concerned about that either, even
                    when it got started, until they screwed it up, which is another part of the
                    story.</p>
                <p>I go down there and create this image of openness. And within days I am invited
                    by the President of Honduras, a man by the name of Roberto Suazo Cordova, a
                    medical doctor, to a private dinner. It was hosted by a former Minister of
                    Government. There were four of us there. I didn't know in advance what this was
                    about. But what it was about was that the President of Honduras was feeling me
                    out on my views about the Honduran political scene. “Isn't it terrible, isn't
                    the instability bad and the coming election is complicating matters, etc.” It
                    became very clear about a third of the way into the evening that what he wanted
                    to feel me out on was his intention to stay in office. There were elections
                    scheduled and eventually held in November. Here he was feeling me out and I am
                    replying early in the evening, that we think the political situation is pretty
                    good, that the coming elections are pretty important to maintain that stability,
                    that the transfer of power from one president to another will only strengthen
                    your government and will strengthen our policy. He keeps going on, thinking, I
                    suppose, “Doesn't this gringo hear what I am saying?”, and getting blunter and
                    blunter. By the end of the evening I said, “Mr. President, let me be as clear as
                    I possibly can. We support the electoral process. We are very desirous that
                    these elections come off and I will do everything in my power to insure that
                    these elections come off.” He mumbled a lot and that was the end of the evening.
                    That was also the end of my productive relationship with the President of
                    Honduras.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, their Congress goes into recess. He tries to convene a surprise
                    session. The head of the Congress calls me up one day in early October. A man
                    with the strange name of Bu Siron. He said he had to see me. He comes over to
                    the Embassy and says the President is calling a surprise session of Congress
                    that afternoon. That he is going to propose that the elections be postponed for
                    two years and that he would stay in power during these two years. Bu Siron said
                    that I have to stop it. I said, “Wait a minute, this is your country. The United
                    States doesn't dictate what goes on in these countries anymore. This is your
                    problem, not our problem. Our policy is that we want the elections, but I don't
                    intervene.”</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>However, as I was saying this, which was the appropriate thing to say for the
                    record, I realized I had to implement our policy, which was that we wanted those
                    elections held. So after he left I called the PAO to get the press in and to
                    tell them the questions I wanted them to ask me. They came and interviewed me
                    and I said, “Ask me what we think about the electoral process.” So they went
                    live on the air and I said, “The United States is strongly in support of the
                    electoral process and therefore we believe the scheduled elections are very
                    important for Honduran democratic development.”</p>
                <p>Then Bu Siron called me back and said that Suazo was still going through with it
                    and could I come and sit in the Congressional gallery while this was going on.
                    So I trot down there just to lend my physical presence in the gallery. There are
                    some people in front of the Congress milling around. They had heard what was
                    happening. It was a very small demonstration, it wasn't much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this all communicated and discussed with
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Well, before going on the air I called up Washington and talked to the
                    fellow who took the job Abrams wanted me to have, Bill Walker, now Ambassador in
                    El Salvador. And I said, “Look, this is what is going on and this is what I
                    propose doing.” Walker in his...I do not regard him highly, but I will not use
                    snide remarks or anything... He said something to the effect, “Well, just be
                    very careful, don't screw up. If there is going to be a coup we want to be with
                    the new government too.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not real guidance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: It wasn't guidance at all.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I go ahead with the press conference and then I subsequently go down to
                    the Congress at the president of Congress' request. There were people just
                    milling around and Suazo wasn't pushing to get the meeting going on time. The
                    press was down there. They asked me my opinion about what was going to happen
                    with this vote. I said that I couldn't express an opinion on an internal matter
                    like that. That was certainly up to the Honduran people, the Honduran Congress.
                    We cannot intervene in that matter, those days are past. However...and I said
                    something that they cartooned me saying...”I am a professional observer. All my
                    career I have been looking at foreign developments closely on the scene just
                    like a reporter. Therefore I think I am a pretty good observer of what is going
                    on.” I said, “From all this demonstration down there”...I am saying this from
                    the balcony...”and what I have seen, it seems to me that the Honduran people
                    really want this electoral process to go forward. The view of the Honduran
                    people is, in my humble opinion, that they want these elections to come off.” So
                    that gets out over television.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>The session just kind of degenerates and never comes to a vote. President Suazo
                    Cordova has even a lower opinion of John Ferch by this time.</p>
                <p>Now this may seem irrelevant, but it is not. The next event is the Contras come
                    into Honduras with their first load of beans, or whatever it is, and in their
                    own fumbling style they invited the US press on their plane. They land in
                    Tegucigalpa, pull up to the military side of the airport. The press jumps out
                    and starts filming the Contras on unloading their beans in Tegucigalpa. An
                    Honduran officer in charge looks at this and says, “Gee, what is going on here?”
                    The Hondurans always maintained that the Contras weren't even there. So he
                    rushes out and stops the whole procedure and takes control of the goods.</p>
                <p>Now, the Hondurans are sitting on the goods, the Contras want them and the United
                    States Government is very agitated. But it is still legal.</p>
                <p>I am told to go in and persuade Suazo Cordova to give the beans to the Contras.
                    Now, just remember how Suazo thinks about John Ferch, who was just instrumental
                    in thwarting his extralegal presidential ambitions. He thinks he finally has
                    something on me. He has got some leverage that maybe he can use. So he mumbles
                    when I call on him and doesn't act. He says that all the military are pressuring
                    him. I said, “Look, I can guarantee that the Contras won't do this again. They
                    will be more discreet in the future. We have talked to the Contras in Washington
                    and I am told that they will manage this better.”</p>
                <p>Nothing happens. Washington is getting more and more agitated. President Suazo
                    Cordova is getting more and more conniving. He thinks he has something here.</p>
                <p>Then, coincidentally at the same time, we do not disburse the bulk of our foreign
                    assistance because the Hondurans didn't meet the conditions precedent...the
                    details are important. He needed the money and we weren't releasing that. So now
                    he needed two things from us. He wanted the money released without complying
                    with the conditions...they were all economic conditions, nothing to do with the
                    Contras...and of course he wanted to stay in office. He had the lever he thought
                    would do it, which was Contra aid.</p>
                <p>Washington sent me back, I don't know how many times, to try to persuade him. Now
                    here is the guy who cut off his aid, in his mind...because I was the Ambassador
                    on the spot when the aid was cut off and I am the guy who did stand up and
                    express those views about the electoral process. He is not budging an inch.</p>
                <p>So Ollie North flies down to try to persuade him. He doesn't budge him. Around
                    this time I am beginning to get rumors that Ferch is screwing up down there. He
                    can't keep his country in line. He can't get anything moving.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Poindexter comes down with a cast of thousands. He can't sway him. Suazo is still
                    sitting there. He has this one trump and the election is coming closer and
                    closer. At the very end of the process he did something else again to try to
                    stop the election.</p>
                <p>Anyway the elections are held and Suazo knows his days as President are now
                    numbered. Washington still doesn't have the beans going to the Contras. And we
                    can't do anything with Suazo. Washington finally realizes that they are going to
                    have to just wait this thing out. Nevertheless, Washington in the form of
                    Elliott Abrams, I guess, and a lot of other people are teed off at me now
                    because this had happened on my watch and I somehow hadn't been able to break
                    the log jam notwithstanding that Poindexter and company couldn't do it
                    either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you hitting them at both ends? Was Washington hitting
                        the Honduran Ambassador in Washington at the same time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: I don't know about that. I suppose so. Even at this time I was so worried
                    to hear about these rumors about myself that I wrote a letter to North because
                    he had something to do with the Contras...he had told me he was the point man. I
                    said, “Look, you couldn't do it, I couldn't do it, yet I hear these rumors.”
                    Whitehead, the Under Secretary, came down and relayed the message that they
                    understood that it was not my doing. But, in fact, Elliott was very upset. He
                    was mad. It seemed irrational, but that was the case.</p>
                <p>The election is in late November. The process is really strange. It was a primary
                    and final election together. Both parties were split into factions. The
                    president came from the party that got the most votes, and the individual who
                    got the most votes among the candidates of that party would be the man who
                    became president. So Azcona won, who was the next President, with less
                    votes...his faction of the Liberal Party received less votes than the leading
                    faction of the Conservative Party. So his election was legal but perceptively
                    blemished.</p>
                <p>We had to deal with this man, so I immediately after the election went over and
                    congratulated him. There was no question of getting instructions from Washington
                    on this because he was the new President under their law. I also in the interim
                    period arranged for him to be briefed by Jack Galvin, who is now NATO Commander,
                    to build up our relationship. I proposed that I could break the economic log jam
                    if he would commit himself to work with me to create a meaningful economic
                    program...I cleared this with Washington earlier, obviously...when he became
                    President, we would disperse half of the money. And when the program was worked
                    up with signatures on it, we would give him the other half.</p>
                <p>I was building the ground for a good relationship with Azcona, and achieved it.
                    But Washington was more concerned with another fact...two facts...that legal
                    Contra aid was not flowing and that the illegal program was underway and they
                    would have to get me on board.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Washington really want Suazo to continue in power even
                        though it meant that the elections would be postponed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: No, I don't think they wanted him in power. But they wanted to be with the
                    winner.</p>
                <p>As I said, the legal program is snarled and Abrams is mad, as well as other
                    people, I assume, and the illegal program is getting started. By illegal program
                    I mean North's operation run by Secord.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This did not yet involve anything in Honduras at that
                        point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: No. But they knew it would and they knew that when it did the American
                    Ambassador would know about it and therefore would have to be brought on
                    board.</p>
                <p>I am just conjecturing what I am about to say, but I think you and those who read
                    this will agree that the conjecture hangs together. I was informed by Walker to
                    come to Washington in December, without an explanation other than that Elliott
                    wanted to talk to me. I was feeling pretty proud of myself by this time, feeling
                    pretty good. We had kept the electoral process going, we were off to a good
                    start with Azcona, I felt my public relations program was paying dividends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the press treating you okay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Oh, beautifully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it a free press?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Yes, pretty much.</p>
                <p>So I didn't know what Abrams was up to but I wasn't concerned about anything. I
                    figured it was working with the new Administration or something. So I fly up to
                    Washington. It was my father's birthday, coincidentally. He was going to be 89.
                    So I took my wife with me. Sue and I both went up and saw him first and then
                    went to Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>It was December 9...obviously these things are very clear in my memory because,
                    as you will see, they were very traumatic. I had an appointment with Elliott
                    late in the evening. It was dark outside at that time of year. I walk in on
                    Elliott in his office. He is alone. Walker is not there. I said, “Well, what do
                    you want to talk about, Elliott?” And right off without any preamble he said,
                    “There is a perception in this town that you don't support us.” [All this is
                    written down. I wrote it up subsequently for the Foreign Service Journal.] I was
                    taken aback. I said, “What do you mean there is a perception that I don't
                    support you? Who?” He said, “There is just a perception.” I couldn't pin him
                    down. We went around and around on why or who. I was getting more and more
                    emotionally agitated. I remember the thought crossed my mind that I was being
                    McCarthyized here. I said, “Well, Elliott, do you share that perception?” He
                    said, “If you say you support us, I will believe you.” I said, “I am a career
                    officer. I support the Administration. I have supported all Administrations.” He
                    said, “I am having a meeting tomorrow and you come to it.”</p>
                <p>We were staying with friends in Bethesda and I go out there. Sue could see that I
                    was up tight. She asked me what it was. I said that I had been subjected to
                    McCarthyite treatment and I told her that I could not understand what was going
                    on. It was extraordinary.</p>
                <p>The next day I go to the meeting. It was what I subsequently learned was the
                    RIGlet, the Restrictive Interdepartment Group, but the small version. There were
                    in Elliott's office, Ollie North, Alan Fiers who was from this building and
                    somebody else. The talk was about the Contras in Honduras and how we needed
                    better control of the Contras, that we had to have the Contras more on board. I
                    could see as the conversation bounced around that I was being put on the spot. I
                    was supposed to respond to this conversation somehow. I didn't know what to say.
                    I found this very puzzling. So I probably mumbled a little, I really don't
                    remember.</p>
                <p>I went back to Tegucigalpa and wondered what I was going to do. I had been put on
                    the spot. They wanted me to take control of the Contras and do something with
                    them. Who do I get advice from? I can't get advice from my boss, Elliott Abrams,
                    who is the guy that put me on the spot. I can't get advice from the guy who said
                    he was responsible for the Contras because he put me on the spot...Ollie North.
                    I didn't know Fiers very well at all.</p>
                <p>Finally it came to me that if they could say this in writing, it was probably
                    okay. I realize that is a very bureaucratic approach to this problem, but it
                    seemed to me if I could get my instruction in writing I could be confident that
                    it was legitimate. So I wrote Elliott a cable and sent it back channel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, they at this point had not asked you to do anything
                        specific?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Nothing specific.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is all totally vague?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: “Somebody has to have responsibility.” “We need to have tighter control.”
                    That type of conversation. It was very vague. Not that we are starting this
                    program and are going to start air dropping in these supplies. None of that
                    stuff. It was vague. But it was clear that I was being put on the spot. But it
                    is also clear, if you think about it, that they, until I was signed on board,
                    couldn't speak about specifics to me. Elliott had softened me up the night
                    before about not being with them. Now I was suppose to commit myself, and I
                    didn't.</p>
                <p>So I send him this telegram in which I said, “I am the American Ambassador and am
                    therefore responsible for all government programs in Honduras and therefore will
                    be responsible for this program. But I will be much more comfortable if you will
                    provide me with my instructions in writing and I will respond in kind.”</p>
                <p>Knowing what we learned afterward and what happened in the development of this
                    program, you can imagine what Elliott Abrams thought when he got that telegram.
                    He is going to put this in writing? I never get an answer. But I do start
                    hearing all sorts of reports that people are dissatisfied with me. A reporter
                    tells me this.</p>
                <p>The inauguration of Azcona comes off and I consider it to be a great success. The
                    Vice President comes down. I get word back that the Vice President is totally
                    irritated by the visit...it is no good. I have my DCM check with the advance man
                    who planned everything and he said it was a great visit. He didn't know what
                    they were talking about. They were building a case.</p>
                <p>After Azcona was inaugurated, I tell him that the Honduran Government had held up
                    Contra aid because the Contras had had the press on the plane. I guaranteed that
                    they will not do that again, that it will be handled discreetly. I would like
                    him to help me out of this. Without hesitation Azcona said, “Yes.” The aid
                    starts flowing, the legitimate aid.</p>
                <p>Washington didn't acknowledge that at all. In fact Elliott was mad that I had
                    dispersed the economic aid to Azcona. I had an AID telegram authorizing me to
                    disperse the aid. Once again he was building a case. He said I should have
                    checked with him. I did not take my orders from AID.</p>
                <p>I had received enough of these complaints that I was beginning to be concerned.
                    So I sent him a letter saying, “Look, I am hearing all of these things. I think
                    I am being discredited. I do not know what is going on here. I want to come up
                    and talk to you. I am going to be in Washington in mid-March and want to talk to
                    you and find out what is going on here. I can't function if I am being
                    undermined like this.” I tried to come to grips with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>When I get up there he has Walker in the room with him. He won't talk about it. I
                    said finally, “I want to talk about that letter.” He said, “You talk to Bill.”
                    And he walked out. He refused to talk to me about the issues that I had raised
                    concerning reports that he was dissatisfied with me. And Walker professed not to
                    know anything about most of those issues. So there was nothing.</p>
                <p>That week, coincidentally, was when the first vote was held on the $100 million
                    on so-called lethal assistance for the Contras and it was rejected by Congress,
                    which was a surprise. Elliott gets it into his head that Hondurans are very
                    upset that the vote was rejected. I hear Thursday, the vote was on Wednesday,
                    that he is going to fly down to Honduras on Friday to reassure them. Although I
                    was getting the flu at that time, I said that I would go down with him, but he
                    said that I should go down on my own, he would handle this.</p>
                <p>Now this was kind of strange. I fly back commercially, sick as a dog; he flew
                    down on a government flight without me and met the Hondurans...only my DCM was
                    there. According to my DCM, Abrams said to Azcona that he knew the Hondurans
                    were very nervous because we didn't get the money for the Contras. [To my
                    knowledge the Hondurans had never expressed their view about the vote that
                    failed to get the money, one way or the other.] Therefore we are going to give
                    you your economic assistance up front. That will help you out and we will give
                    you some more military assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had they asked for military assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: No. This is all Abrams' initiative. But he had forgotten that the economic
                    aid had already been given. That was the ironic part of it. He leaves a man down
                    in Tegucigalpa to work up a wish list for military aid. Coincidentally, that
                    next Sunday morning there is fighting on the border. The Sandinistas actually
                    pursued some Contras back into Honduras and the Hondurans were very concerned.
                    They didn't know what was going to happen. Whether this was going to evolve into
                    a bigger fighting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Up to this time the Contras had been supporting themselves
                        with their own resources in Honduras with the Hondurans tacit agreement. Was
                        that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Anyway, the Hondurans are very antsy about the fighting. This incursion is
                    coincidental, you see, with the vote and Elliott's trip. The incursion offers us
                    an opportunity in that it publicizes the Sandinistas' threat. It makes it
                    possible, in Washington's mind, for the Hondurans to ask for the military
                    assistance. So the Embassy gets instructions to tell the Hondurans to formally
                    ask for the assistance that Elliott had promised on Friday. Azcona said, “No.” I
                    was in bed with the flu and not at the meeting. My DCM did the demarche. Azcona
                    had said no because he thought it would be an admission, in some convoluted way,
                    that somehow the Contras were there.</p>
                <p>Washington, and when I say Washington it is basically Abrams now, gets very
                    antsy. Here he is out on a limb offering money and they won't ask for it. I
                    think probably that he found out that he needed them to ask for it legally. But
                    anyway, he really wanted them to ask for the money he had promised for military
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>It gets into the press and Washington is depicted as agitated and the Hondurans
                    appear calm. It even got out in the press erroneously that the Honduran
                    Government went on vacation, as everyone does in Latin America on Holy Week.</p>
                <p>Monday and Tuesday went by and more agitation. I realized that I had to get off
                    my sick bed and call in some more chips. This was just getting too much. So
                    Tuesday morning I called on the President and said, “Mr. President, let me speak
                    as a friend. I think you are in over your head here. I don't think you have any
                    choice. I think you have to ask for this money. It is my judgment of the
                    political dynamics of the situation...as a friend of yours and a professional
                    here, I think you have to request it, you don't have an option.” He took my
                    advise and said, “Okay.” He took out some paper and wrote a letter. I got it off
                    in a cable and that was the end of that.</p>
                <p>Abrams subsequently blamed me that somehow the Embassy was not able to function
                    well. He argued that we should function in a way that made the Hondurans snap to
                    immediately. He acknowledged that I was home in bed, but said if I had been
                    running a good Embassy, the Embassy would have been able to persuade Azcona
                    immediately, rather than go through that embarrassing delay of several days. He
                    ignored totally the fact that he had offered the money and the Hondurans were
                    totally bemused by this.</p>
                <p>There were a few more incidents that happened that laid a few more bricks on the
                    case, but I won't go into them.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>At the end of June, there is another vote in our Congress and the $100 million of
                    legal assistance passes, so now the Contras are going to get guns as well as
                    beans. Two days after the vote, Elliott calls me up on the secure phone and
                    says, “The Secretary wants you out of there. He is removing you.” I said, “Why?”
                    He said, “You know, there is bad morale in the Embassy and it is going to be
                    very tense now that the war is going to heat up and we need someone to calm down
                    the Embassy.” I said, “What do you mean bad morale?” He said, “We have talked
                    about that.” That is not true. He mentioned the last time I had seen him that
                    there was a report that some of the junior officers were unhappy about
                    something. I had actually followed up on it and my DCM looked into it and wrote
                    Elliott about the situation. He, Elliott, dismissed that. It was the only
                    explanation he would give me. He said, “When are you going to pack your bags?” I
                    said, “Look, Elliott, I am going to stay through the 4th of July”—I knew at that
                    point my career was over. “I am going to tell Azcona myself, I don't want you to
                    do it.” [He said, “Okay,” but he called up Azcona himself before I was able to
                    get to him. I subsequently heard that Azcona said to somebody that Elliott's
                    call was the cruelest thing he had ever heard of.] “I am going out with my head
                    held high. I am going to take all my leave and will come back and pack up in
                    September.”</p>
                <p>Well, he couldn't argue with that. They didn't have a replacement for me. My
                    family was up in Canada at that time. That was the year we built the cabin. So
                    that is what I did. I wrote Secretary Shultz that it was his right to remove me
                    but I felt I deserved an explanation. By this time the press was filled with the
                    story of my removal. This was a real hot spot at the time. And people in
                    Washington, like Bill Walker, in their own very gentle way said that I was
                    screwing up down there. Really I was slandered. In the normal course of events,
                    if this was not government service I could have sued for slander.</p>
                <p>The Secretary wrote apologizing that he had nothing to do with it. I should go on
                    my leave, calm down and not give up on the Foreign Service to which I had given
                    too many years of good service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who do you think drafted that letter for the
                        Secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: He did. The style was George Shultz'. He said to see Mike Armacost when I
                    got back from leave and he would tell me what happened. He was Under Secretary
                    for Political Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Secretary know do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>FERCH: Elliott had built a case and presented all these things that I have just
                    related in a twisted form to the Secretary. Such things like...he didn't hold
                    his country in line over the first shipment (beans); he screwed up the Vice
                    President's visit during the inauguration; he didn't break the log jam quickly
                    enough when the Sandinistas were coming across to get the Contras; and a few
                    other things. He built this case on the flimsiest of evidence.</p>
                <p>In September I called on Armacost and he related all these things to me. He said
                    that this is what Elliott told the Secretary and the Secretary acted upon it. I
                    listen to him, hearing these things for the first time in an articulated form. I
                    responded to Mike saying, “Hey listen, that's not what happened!” He asked,
                    “Weren't you ever counseled by Elliott about these things?” I said, “Absolutely
                    not. No one has ever told me anything. When I tried to deal with him he refused
                    to talk.” Then I gave him my version of the events. He said, “Well it is too
                    late now.” I said, “Well, I am going to have to quit. My career is at an end.”
                    He said, “No, don't do that hastily. You are going to go up to Brown.” They had
                    to do something with me and I was going up to Brown as Diplomat in
                    Residence...George Vest, the Director General, was very good about arranging
                    that. I remember he was first going to send me to some other place but I wanted
                    to be close to a good airport, knowing that if I was going to be looking for a
                    job I would be traveling a lot.</p>
                <p>This was in late September, 1986. The timing is important because I would go
                    directly to Brown in Providence. You can imagine that this development is very
                    shattering to us. A week after we arrived at Brown, Secord's Contra plane was
                    shot down by the Sandinistas, but one man to survived. He talked about the
                    Enterprise, and the scandal began to unfold.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before that you had not known about the illegal
                        shipments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Nothing at all.</p>
                <p>Almost immediately upon my reaching Brown the scandal begins to unfold. I was now
                    able to piece together the scandal and what had happened to me. When I was
                    removed, after Mike gave me Elliott's story, I still didn't know why he was
                    lying. But as the scandal unfolded, I went back over my memory and said, “Hey, I
                    was put on the spot, 'You don't support the Administration.' And then they want
                    me to take responsibility for the Contras. They were at that time building these
                    airports.” You can piece it together like this, what was going on.</p>
                <p>During the course of the scandal I saw Mike Armacost again and George Vest quite
                    a few times because he was holding my hand. George said, “Well, you have been
                    stabbed in the back by Elliott but you just have to wait this out.” But Mike at
                    some point in the course of the unfolding scandal said, “Really, don't give up.
                    There will be another Administration.” In effect he said I would be persona
                    grata, that I had handled myself well and that the story was now coming out.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>This second conversation with Mike occurred towards the end of the academic year.
                    I had not yet located a job. Replying to Mike I said, “You know that is good
                    advice.” I thought I was being vindicated. I had done the right thing. Whatever
                    Administration comes on board will probably view it that way and will want
                    people like myself whose hands were evidently clean. So I decided to stay in the
                    Service until the elections. But my emotions were too raw to wait out the period
                    in State. So I told Mike, I'm just too mad at this building to want to work
                    here. So I will get myself a job and you pay for it.” I called up some friends
                    on the Hill and said I wanted to work up there. So George crafted a program for
                    me and got me lined up with Bill Bradley.</p>
                <p>After the election and the Bush victory, I approached Larry Eagleburger, the new
                    Deputy Secretary, and asked him to find out if I was persona grata with the new
                    White House. One of his aides called me back and said, “No, they won't give you
                    anything.”</p>
                <p>So I decided to retire and sent my letter in. There was no future for me, a man
                    has to have a little pride. I was not going to stick around just to have a job.
                    Fortunately I had enough years in so I could retire.</p>
                <p>I retired effective in May. I took the 3-months job search program the Department
                    has and started looking for a job again. The best offer came from the Agency and
                    that is how I ended up here at the National Intelligence Council. To my surprise
                    my reputation with the Agency was very, very high. Over the years I had
                    developed quite a reputation out here and they offered me this job. Some people
                    might find a little bit of irony in that, but so be it. It is a good job and I
                    am doing economic work on issues of global significance.</p>
                <p>Let's bring this to a close with the satisfying and the down sides of the
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask one question before we leave this final
                        disaster. You said earlier when I first called you that you felt the Service
                        had let you down as an organization. What do you think the Service could
                        have done differently and should have done differently, aside from Elliott
                        Abrams role in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: That was going to be the down side of what I was going to say. So why
                    don't I say the good side first.</p>
                <p>I don't regret one minute of my Service career. I think the Foreign Service gave
                    me and my family one of the most satisfying experiences any American
                    professional can have. I really enjoyed all of my assignments. I enjoyed where I
                    was, the work I did. I think I contributed. There are not many people who can
                    prevent a coup in a coup-prone country. And there were other little things in
                    which the course of history was altered in a very modest way by me. So I found
                    the Foreign Service very satisfying.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>What did I find satisfying about it, why did I like it? Why do I recommend it so
                    much? It seems to me that the Service offers you an opportunity to be truly
                    creative. You are sent abroad, I tell people, to further US interests. You are
                    not usually sent abroad with a narrow mandate, especially if you are on the
                    substantive side of the house, doing economic or political work. You are
                    supposed to know what our interests are and then within the parameters of your
                    job pursue them.</p>
                <p>Now if you have good supervisors, good superior officers, they won't constrain
                    your work. They won't tell you to do x, y and z and that fills your working
                    week. They will let you fill your working week with broad guidance. I
                    fortunately never had a bad supervisor. I always was allowed to be
                    creative...this is what I will report on, this is what I will pursue, this is
                    what I think is important. I don't think there are many jobs where you can do
                    something like that. If you are a lawyer, the work comes to you and you handle
                    it. If you are a doctor, the work comes to you. You don't create your work. I
                    suppose a creative artist would be more satisfying, but you have to have
                    artistic talent to do that, which I don't suggest I have.</p>
                <p>But anyway I found the Foreign Service to be just absolutely satisfying in that
                    respect. To be able to employ my abilities, talents, whatever they are, to the
                    pursuit of our national interests in a setting...I am trying to get the National
                    Geographic back into this. Here I was, drawn into the Foreign Service by the
                    National Geographic and now I am allowed to pursue our national interests in a
                    setting defined by the National Geographic. It was a lot of fun. All the
                    countries I served in I loved. I became a Latinophile, but I don't ever think I
                    lost a sense of our interests in that. I earlier said that I don't elevate Latin
                    America to a very high level of importance in the scheme of things. But a career
                    there was great in every respect. An opportunity to be a true manager, run big
                    programs, shape those big programs. We had a $400 million AID program in
                    Honduras and I was in the process of trying to alter it a little bit. A lot of
                    fun and satisfying.</p>
                <p>Satisfying for my wife and for my kids. When they were young and teenagers, they
                    didn't think so. When we came back in the mid- '70s they quickly forgot their
                    Spanish and had to relearn it again when we went back down South. But now they
                    look back and say that no one else has that kind of experience.</p>
                <p>That is the up side and it is a big up side. In my mind it wipes out everything
                    else, including the way my career ended. I have never had the sense that because
                    of the way it ended I wish I had never gotten into it.</p>
                <p>However, because of the way it ended, my feeling for the Foreign Service as an
                    institution is considerably altered. I do not go to Foreign Service events
                    because of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Let's end with one thing. Elliott makes a case against me. I think what I have
                    said is fairly convincing that he had to get rid of me because of the illegal
                    program, because I had sent the telegram, and because, therefore, he could not
                    judge it safe to have me involved in these things, and thus I had to go. I
                    clearly, in his terms, didn't support the Administration. His terms, not the
                    proper terms. When he made the case...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because at that point in your letter you were still
                        dealing with what you thought were legal programs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: That is right. But he had to get rid of me because of the illegal program.
                    And he also...I must say I will never forgive the man or the Service for
                    allowing him to do it either...he accused my wife of meddling in Embassy
                    affairs. Totally false. Everything was basically a lie, a twisting of facts.</p>
                <p>But, why am I bitter? Not because of him. But when he did it no one said, “Let's
                    call Ferch up here and see what he has to say.” The Secretary didn't say it.
                    Now, I have a high regard for George Shultz and he has, subsequent to my
                    departure from the Service, written me various letters of recommendation for
                    jobs I was seeking at the time. I think George Shultz had a very high regard for
                    me. I can go back to an incident in Cuba which makes me think that...but that is
                    neither here nor there. But he didn't say, “Hey, Elliott let's bring Ferch up
                    here and see what he has to say.” He probably said, as Mike inferred, “Have you
                    counseled Ferch?” And Elliott said, “Yes.”</p>
                <p>In my efficiency report, by the way, Elliott asserts that he counseled me. He
                    asserts that the meetings on December 9 and 10, those two meetings I mentioned,
                    were meetings to talk about my failures as an administrator of the Embassy. In
                    writing he said that. That I know is a total lie. I know what went on in those
                    meetings. I can't prove it. Anyway, he cites those as times when he counseled
                    me. George Shultz didn't say, “You say you counseled him, let's bring him up
                    here before we do this, remove him.”</p>
                <p>George Vest didn't say anything. George Vest was the institution. He was
                    subsequently very supportive and helpful to me. But he didn't say, “Hey, you
                    can't do that to a senior officer, a man who has been in the Service x number of
                    years. You have to hear his side of the story.”</p>
                <p>No one else said it. I don't know who else might do it. Certainly no one in ARA.
                    They didn't want to cross Elliott's path. My colleagues, my peers, very few of
                    them stuck their head out and said, “Hey, John that is terrible what happened.”
                    Only Ed Corr did. Now that may be a reflection of how many friends I have in the
                    Service, but I don't think so. I think it is a reflection on Service mentality.
                    At least at that time no one was going to stick their neck out.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>So, as I say, institutionally, the Service didn't say, “Let's hear what he has to
                    say.” It was done without reference to me. How can you after having spent as
                    many years as I did in the Foreign Service, and loved it, look back now and say,
                    “Hey, the Foreign Service as an institution treated me right.” You can't say
                    that. So the ending of my career did not alter my view about my career, but it
                    certainly altered my view of the Foreign Service. It does not lead me to say,
                    “Don't go into the Foreign Service.” My son is taking the exam this year. But it
                    does tell me that as an organization it has a lot of failings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Concentrated, I would say, at the top of the careers where
                        things become political more than coming up through. This was my impression,
                        that the structure works really quite well coming up through...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Hey listen, let me tell you a neat little story about my second assignment
                    along the lines of the Service working right at lower levels.</p>
                <p>When I was on the mission of the OAS, at that time I was 24-25, a young kid, I
                    was feeling my oats one day. I came back to my office where I shared a secretary
                    with several people. I said something that really offended the secretary, but
                    all I was doing was bubbling, a kid full of himself. The woman turned out to
                    have a clinical emotional problem, so you had to deal with her very carefully,
                    but I didn't realize that. I upset her greatly. She complained. As a result of
                    the complaint I was called up to the 7th floor, I can't remember who it was I
                    saw. But I remember, as only a young man can remember, that there was an office
                    with beautiful windows looking out over the Lincoln Memorial, and the office
                    furniture wasn't standard government issue and there was an Oriental rug on the
                    floor. Finally there was this guy sitting behind the desk, a man off the front
                    pages of the Washington Post. He didn't invite me to sit down but began directly
                    by saying to me, “She is as nutty as a fruit cake, but who will replace her?
                    You, however, with all your qualifications are a dime a dozen. Don't you ever do
                    it again.” I thought that was marvelous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How had it gotten all the way up to the 7th floor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: I don't know. He wasn't going to lose me. He recognized a junior officer
                    with talent, but he was going to tell him some facts of life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one last question. I know that this was on a
                        political level and so was perhaps out of the Inspector General's purview,
                        but is it possible that the Inspector General's Office might have given you
                        some sort of back up at that moment that might have helped you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Oh, I couldn't answer that. I don't know. It was too late.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had already happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Once George Shultz had authorized it....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't know you were in trouble in time to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: No, excuse me, I had been picking up those vibrations. Remember I said I
                    wrote a letter to Abrams saying that I wanted to talk to him about this. But at
                    that time it was only Elliott building the case. Where the institution failed me
                    was when he presented the case. The institution should have said, “Call Ferch up
                    and let us hear from him.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You haven't mentioned any bridge building to the Hill in
                        the course of your career. I gather that you preserved your way within the
                        Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: What do you mean building a bridge?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean...Ambassador Muccio, who I served under, was
                        always going up to the Hill whenever he went back to Washington and I think
                        this was part of his strength as an ambassador. If you had had stronger
                        allies on the Hill, perhaps they couldn't have dared to treat you that
                        way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: I am sure you are right. No, I didn't. Between assignments, when I was
                    back on consultations, I would go up on the Hill and talk to staffers. But that
                    was just routine. I have to conclude that I am a very poor bureaucrat, I did not
                    do things like that. I always felt that your record would carry you. And it
                    always had for me. I had no reason to doubt. There were times in my career when
                    I got promoted really fast and times when it seemed like it took four years for
                    a promotion I had hoped for in three years. But basically, I saw hard creative
                    work rewarded. I didn't see the need of all that...the conscious building of
                    bridges. Actually it really never crossed my mine. I just didn't do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am just wondering what of your experience on this tape
                        can be of guidance to a junior officer just starting in the Service to help
                        him as he goes along? Of course the world is changing as is the
                        Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>FERCH: I have an answer to that but I am not sure that I could have acted on it.
                    When Elliott called me and said that the Secretary wants to remove me, I could
                    have said, “I am on the next airplane. I am cabling the Secretary right now
                    asking for an appointment.” The recommendation would be to confront them. But I
                    was so traumatized I didn't do that. I think the lesson in this is that you
                    shouldn't let yourself be pushed around by politically driven people like
                    Elliott Abrams. It might have done some good if I had done that, I am not
                    sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would really depend on that person's character at that
                        level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: That is right. And I certainly would have felt better about myself since
                    then. However, you have to remember, I didn't know why he was doing it. The
                    story that I pieced together was only pieceable because the scandal subsequently
                    unfolded and I was able to put it all together. In other words, when I went up,
                    if I had done that, I wouldn't have known what was going on. I probably wouldn't
                    have seen the importance of their saying that somebody has to take
                    responsibility for the Contras and that I sent the cable saying that I would do
                    it but put it in writing. At that time I wouldn't have seen the significance of
                    that. So I am not sure that the lesson that I have thought about is even a
                    meaningful lesson.</p>
                <p>Another lesson for the junior officer...”The Foreign Service is great. If this be
                    the end of your career it is a traumatizing end, but everything else is worth
                    it.”</p>
                <p>What I regret most of all, though, is that it traumatized my wife more than
                    anything else because he created a case that largely involved her. She can't get
                    out of her head that she caused the end of my career. That is dirty. What he did
                    to her, I will never forgive him. The case that she meddled in Embassy
                    administrative affairs... John was a bad manager, but largely because of
                    her.</p>
                <p>Another thing you hear about the case he built, this gets back to your question
                    about the institution...if you go back through my personnel file, you will find
                    that my interest in management is reflected in the file and that I was always
                    marked high in that area. All of a sudden, this case which basically said I was
                    mismanaging the embassy, creating poor morale, etc. appeared...all of a sudden
                    this man after 27 years was doing everything wrong as a manager and the Service
                    never said, “Hey, this doesn't square. We praised this man, we saw him as one of
                    our better managers.”</p>
                <p>Institutionally, Personnel never stepped forward. You would have thought that
                    somebody would have done that. After all it was not consistent with the record.
                    Somebody should have gone to George Vest and said, “You realize what Ferch's
                    background file says? Let's look into it.” Speaking of my record, it closed on a
                    note of beautiful irony. The year Abrams removed me, I received a Presidential
                    Award bonus. By the way, I had received up to that point bonuses every year
                    since they were initiated. I suspect few other senior officers had such a
                    record.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>I don't see the Foreign Service as being filled by a lot of mutually supportive
                    individuals. I am not sure it is a Service.</p>
                <p>So that is it. But I don't want to turn people off on the Service even though I
                    have a bitterness. That doesn't keep me awake at night, but I think my feeling
                    is legitimate and will carry it with me for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now I can sympathize with your feelings, but it seems to
                        me though as you came along that you had quite a lot of support from people
                        around you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: That is well said and you mentioned that earlier and it should be balanced
                    against my remarks about institutional failings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More than I think a lot of careers would show.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: I think you are absolutely right. I take it back when you put it that way.
                    I am still reflecting a bitterness that when I was recalled my peers didn't
                    stand up and say, “Hey, this is a man...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the chips were down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FERCH: Yes. But you are right. A lot of people helped me along the way, an awful
                    lot. A lot of people said, “Hey this is a guy with a future, we are going to
                    help him along.” Every one of my superiors let me be creative. But then I was
