                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is October 2, 1996. This is an interview with
                        Ambassador Robert L. Barry done on the behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Bob and I are old
                        colleagues having worked in Yugoslavia back in the 1960s to put this in
                        context. Bob, could you tell me about first when and where you were born and
                        something about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I was born in Pittsburgh in 1934 and I spent the first five or six
                    years of my life there, but my father was in the Army Air Corps reserve. He had
                    been a pilot in World War I and was active in flying when he was not doing his
                    regular job. He was called to active duty in 1940 before Pearl Harbor and so I
                    spent the next several years as an army brat traveling around to one military
                    post to another. We finally settled in Philadelphia after the war and that's
                    where I went to high school. I went to college then at Dartmouth College
                    starting in 1952 graduating with the class of 1956 where I majored in
                    international relations with particular emphasis on the Soviet Union, Eastern
                    Europe, Eastern European history and all that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Dartmouth, did you find was there any, let's see when
                        did yoattend there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: '52 to '56.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, the Cold War was really beginning to crank up about
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, and of course, my father was called to active duty again in the
                    Korean War, so between 1950 and 1952 I spent more time in military bases around
                    then and so this was really kind of the height of the Cold War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any thrust to what you were getting at
                        Dartmouth, I'm just trying to figure out how the students and the faculty
                        looked on the international relations front. Because you were still in what
                        was termed in my generation, too. I graduated from Williams in 1950, as sort
                        of the silent generation. I'm not sure that we were that silent. Did you get
                        any?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, the president of Dartmouth at that time was a man named John Sloan
                    Dickey who had been active in foreign affairs in the State Department or some
                    related agency during the UN formative years. There was a lot of enthusiasm
                    about the UN. There were some very good people on the faculty at Dartmouth at
                    that time who were Soviet experts who were some of the people who worked on
                    centrally planned economies and all that kind of thing. There was a very active
                    program in great issues that everybody had to take so you had to attend as a
                    freshman lectures on the main issues of the day. So, it was a rather
                    internationalist campus. The international relations major was quite small.
                    There were only about seven or eight of us. There was an interdisciplinary major
                    who had a lot of economics and political science, courses in foreign cultures
                    and things like that. So, that was kind of a self-selected group of people that
                    were particularly interested in what was going on in the outside world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you at all pointing yourself towards the
                        ForeigService at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: It was something that had entered my mind, but I was part of the Naval
                    ROTC regular program which was a scholarship program which you took an exam for
                    in high school. Basically the navy paid for your full college education with the
                    idea that you would get a regular navy commission when you graduated. The hope
                    was that a lot of people would stay in as a career. I had not ever particularly
                    thought I would, but at least my immediate post college fate was pretty much
                    decided by being in that program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you graduated in 1956 did you go into the
                        navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: No, not right away. I got a scholarship to Oxford, something called the
                    Reynolds Fellowship, which was not as prestigious as the Rhodes, but actually
                    did have more money. I got a leave of absence from the navy to go take that
                    scholarship up. When at Oxford I studied both the field of politics, philosophy
                    and economics, but also, I spent a lot of time at Saint Anthony's College which
                    was the place where they did a lot of graduate work on the Soviet Union,
                    international affairs. The chancellor of the college I was in was Allen Bullock
                    who had done a history of Hitler and the rise of fascism. They were all kinds of
                    fascinating people there who knew a great deal about this part of the world, so
                    I had a fairly enjoyable time there. I traveled in the meantime to Eastern
                    Europe for the first time. In fact, I embarked upon an effort to go to Hungary
                    during the Hungarian Revolution in 1956.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: October '56.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BARRY: 1956. Well, it was not October when I left, it was December when I left
                    because of the fact that we had to go on term leave, but the events in Hungary
                    were still taking place in December of 1956. In fact we did get across the
                    border into Hungary. The Soviets had not yet come all the way down to the border
                    and so the Hungarian Resistance still controlled a little bit of the territory
                    across the Austrian border, but the last remnants were coming out, going across
                    the mine fields, getting themselves blown up and things like that. I was always
                    happy to tell the Hungarians in later years that I first came to the country
                    illegally during the period of the Hungarian Revolution. I also got to
                    Yugoslavia at that time, twice as a matter of fact. In fact, that's where I met
                    my wife who was then studying in France. She joined a bunch of us who were in
                    fact on our way to Hungary at that point. As I say, when we got into Hungary we
                    discovered the tanks were moving toward the border. We kind of gave that project
                    up for the time being and went to Yugoslavia instead. That was kind of an early
                    acquaintance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Yugoslavia? You were there in
                        lat'56?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Complete silence. I've never seen a place that was as silent as Zagreb.
                    That day we got off the train in Zagreb there was not a car in sight. All you
                    could hear was the sound of people walking up and down the street. It was grim
                    and gloomy and dark. This was December. Poor. I remember how unsmiling the
                    people were. It looked the way you thought a communist country would look when
                    you had read about all the grimness of the communist economic regime. When were
                    you first there?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About that time, except I went during the summer and it
                        was a little more pleasant. We went down to Srebrenica and I was in
                        Frankfurt and we took a trip there and we kind of liked it but, of course, I
                        think winter in the city and summer on the coast are two different things.
                        Well, then you finished your scholarship and then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Then I did three years on a destroyer out of Newport, Rhode Island where
                    we spent a lot of time in fact in the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. Then in
                    the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf in some of the early patrols we had in that
                    area. So, in fact, it was while I was in the navy that I took the Foreign
                    Service exam in Milan. I managed to get a day off from the ship, went up to
                    Milan, took the exam and then came back and rejoined the ship. It was an
                    interesting three years. I had rather hoped that my specialization in this part
                    of the world would lead me to an assignment in naval intelligence, but no they
                    wanted people who would go on the ships. So, I did that time. I'm not sorry in
                    retrospect that I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you were on the destroyer you went up, what
                        patrolling in the Red Sea?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, the Middle East force was the predecessor, but we'd had it there for
                    several years before I did it. I did it in '58 and '59, but we were sort of
                    taking over from the British in showing the flag and sending our destroyer
                    around from Bahrain to Kuwait and Basra and places like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to ask, did your destroyer get a bad case of
                        hepatitis or not because I was in Dhahran at that time as the vice consul
                        and we had one of those destroyers come in and they'd eaten shell fish in
                        Naples or something. We had to practically to take out the entire engine
                        room staff of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: No, we escaped that although I did get into personal trouble because I was
                    in charge at that point of the wardroom mess and the person who does that has
                    got to buy food. We ended up in Eritrea and I found a bargain in rabbits and
                    bought a large quantity of rabbits to stock the wardroom with which none of my
                    fellow officers didn't like so much, but no we escaped the disease field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your time in the navy because you really were in much more
                        of an international cruise mode you might say than many of your colleagues
                        with the Middle East and the Mediterranean. Did this do anything at all to
                        whet your appetite for the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, by that time I had pretty much decided that was what I wanted to do.
                    I had spent a fair amount of time traveling around Europe as well while I was in
                    the university. At the same time I got a Ford Foundation Fellowship just before
                    I got out of the navy. The Ford was one of these early foreign affairs training
                    fellowships, which was for two years and so that was to attend the program on
                    East Central Europe, at Columbia University. So, I'm getting out of the navy. I
                    had passed the Foreign Service exam, but had not at that point been called up
                    for orals. So, I went to Columbia and did a lot of work both on Eastern Europe
                    in general on this program, which was rather like the Russian Institute. It was
                    Henry Roberts who was the head of the program at the time and they had a bunch
                    of bright young professors there. Among the ones who arrived the same year I did
                    was Zbig Brzezinski who had just moved from Harvard to Columbia. Actually my
                    specialty there was Yugoslavia. I started to learn Serbo-Croatian at Columbia
                    and did a history degree, too. My history thesis was the 14th Century Empire of
                    Stephan Dushan. I never thought at the time that that would again become
                    relevant with the whole issue of Kosovo had become a matter of history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: History was just yesterday in Yugoslavia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, it was much more distant then that it is today I'afraid.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you married at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, Peggy and I got married as soon as I got out of the navy and we went
                    to live in New York together. Actually we took a honeymoon again in Europe and
                    spent a good deal of that time in Yugoslavia and traveled up and down the
                    Dalmatian Coast and that was the summer and it was much brighter and better
                    looking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took the Foreign Service exam when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: '58. No, it must have been '59.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any recollections of how it was conducted and
                        whasort of things you were asked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, of course, the written exam was fairly much like the Scholastic
                    Aptitude Test. It was a general knowledge kind of exam. So, in that sense I
                    don't know if it was all that different from what people take today. The oral
                    exam I took after I was at Columbia and that was very different than it was
                    today. The purpose of the examining panel was to back you to the wall and see
                    how you reacted under these circumstances, that is to exhaust your supply of
                    knowledge on any given subject and try to embarrass you about it and see how you
                    responded to being under pressure. I remember that they were quite successful in
                    exhausting my field of knowledge. They said, “Well, young man since you were in
                    the navy, you will know the answer to the question which we're about to ask,
                    which is, presuming that the three mile territorial waters limit will change to
                    a 12 mile limit in international law, which straits are now open to transit by
                    war vessels or civilian vessels would be closed?” I managed to mumble through a
                    couple of them, but I missed most of them. “Well, you know something about
                    Eastern Europe. Name all the rivers that flow into the Danube” and that kind of
                    thing. Then they would ask you a question about some event of the day. I guess
                    the event of the day that was still high in peoples' minds was Suez, so the
                    question was, take a position on the Suez Canal controversy of 1956 one way or
                    the other and defend it and that kind of thing. So, it was a much more testing
                    kind of experience. As I got up from the chair I was, I noticed that the whole
                    chair was soaking wet as I had been sweating through this thing. They said, “Do
                    you think you passed?” I said, “No, I don't think I passed.” They said, “Well,
                    tell us why you don't think you passed.” I explained that I didn't think I knew
                    as much as I should have about this, that and the other and finally one of them
                    winked at me and said, “You did pass.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's a far cry from the way it is now as an
                        attempt to almost take it out of the hands of people and make sure that the

                <p>BARRY: I did a tour as an examiner once for a few weeks and I must say that I
                    didn't enjoy the experience at all. You weren't even allowed to ask people what
                    made them think they wanted to join the Foreign Service and as a result we got a
                    lot of people who didn't really want to join the Foreign Service and who didn't
                    have much of an idea about what it was like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you come into the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I entered in February of '62. I hadn't yet finished the two years at
                    Columbia, but at that point the Foreign Service said come now because my name
                    had been on the register as long as it could be without my being removed from
                    it. If I wanted to come in at all, I should come in then. Also, I said, this is
                    a good deal for you, you're paying good money to send people to the same program
                    that I'm in at Columbia, I'm being paid by the Ford Foundation, why don't you
                    extend the thing and let me stay? They said, “Well, we don't really believe in
                    this kind of thing. We don't send junior officers to Eastern Europe anyhow.
                    You're studying Eastern Europe. We may never have a need for you in Eastern
                    Europe. So, if you need training, we'll decide what kind of training and we'll
                    give it to you so, leave the program.” So, I did, but I managed to complete my
                    degree after coming down to Washington in February of '62.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I assume you went into the basic officers' course,
                        the A10course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give a little feel about the type of people who
                        were ithere and what the training was like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, of course the average age of the people was considerably below what
                    it is today because at that point the maximum age for entry was 32. Most of them
                    had done some graduate work or some military or both. It was about 85% or 90%
                    male. There were about five or so women, most of who did not stay on because
                    they got married and at that point you couldn't stay in under those
                    circumstances. I think if I'm correct, all of them were white. Most of them were
                    from the usual Ivy League colleges and that kind of thing. The course itself was
                    taught by two mid-level Foreign Service officers who were in charge of the
                    course at that time. It was clearly not a much sought after assignment I
                    wouldn't have thought. The one person I remember shocked my wife and a couple of
                    other wives whom she became close friends with at the time because the wife was
                    talking to our wives saying well your first duty in the Foreign Service is to be
                    at your principal officer's or ambassador's house right on the dot no matter
                    what happens. She was giving the example of when her son had fallen off a ladder
                    when they were in some God forsaken place and they thought that he had broken
                    his back. But the ambassador was having a reception and so they went off to the
                    reception without knowing what had happened to the son. This was in fact
                    somebody German who had married an American Foreign Service officer, but it
                    didn't do much to make the idea of the government appealing to the people like
                    Peggy. There was a good side to the thing in that there was a good deal of
                    sensitivity training, playacting and telling you how foreigners felt differently
                    about your personal space around you and whether you pointed the sole of your
                    feet at them or not. There was a consular segment that was much more focused on
                    getting the regulations memorized than I guess is the case today. There was a
                    fair amount going around of sort of kicking the tires of other government
                    agencies to sort of see what they did and that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got out of there again, we're talking about
                        '62?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BARRY: '62 was the time I came up for assignment. Actually there were two of us
                    at the time who were very keen on going to someplace in the communist world for
                    our first tour even though it had never been done before. I guess the person who
                    had been the junior officer assignment person had listened to us both carefully
                    and I think he had been assigned in that part of the world himself. Anyhow, he
                    must have put in a good word for us because Tom Niles and I had both been in the
                    same class were both assigned to Yugoslavia for our first tour. So, then there
                    was Serbo Croatian training. While waiting for the course to start, I worked on
                    the Yugoslav desk. I think it was Clayton Mudd who was the desk officer at that
                    time. The first thing I ever had to deal with was the Artukovich deportation
                    case. Andrej Artukovich was the Interior Minister of the fascist government, the
                    Ustasi government of Croatia during World War II, notorious for having kept a
                    jar of eyeballs on his desk as a paperweight that had been gouged out of the
                    Serbian prisoners' gypsies, etc. He had gotten into the U.S. in the aftermath of
                    World War II under an assumed name. His brother was a prominent contractor in
                    California. Although Artukovich was fairly quickly identified and there were a
                    long series of efforts to get him deported, the brother had good connections in
                    California and his efforts were periodically turned back. I do remember that
                    being one of the very first issues that I'd tried to deal with when, actually it
                    was in terms of answering congressional letters explaining why this guy was
                    still here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took Serbian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I took Croatian, no actually the teachers were Serbian. They were a couple
                    of Serbian cavalry officers and they made fun of the Croatians and their
                    penchant for substituting real Croatian words for what they claimed were loan
                    words. One of their favorites was cravat, which is a word, which the French took
                    into their vocabulary through Croatian cavalrymen who wore these little things
                    around their throats. The Serbian teachers were fond of saying that the Croats
                    during this period of linguistic purification insisted that cravat was a loan
                    word. They were going to call it what it really was, okovratnidopupchanik,
                    around the neck to the belly button. Yes, we took a shortened version of the
                    course. We took a 16 or 18 week version.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I went through the same two teachers. I took it with
                        Yankovich. In many ways I look back and it was a pain. At one point Larry
                        Eagleburger and I think Jim Lowenstein, we were all stuck with Popovich, who
                        was very opinionated. I think halfway through we were going to have them all
                        of the 10 or 11 months and we revolted and demanded that they switch around
                        and very begrudgingly they let us. In many ways I found that being exposed
                        to these Serbs was a very good introduction to the mentality of Yugoslavia
                        which still holds good today.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, I think it was probably better for the culturalization than it was
                    for the language because these guys were neither of them too good about
                    following the drills and things like that. We escaped early and I always did
                    feel afterwards that those courses were too long because both Tom and I
                    succeeded in getting a four in Serbo Croatian after we'd been out there for the
                    same amount of time after we'd been in the course for say 18 weeks and out there
                    for another six months in the place. Ours was just as good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom Niles came in his first job, with me, I was chief of
                        thconsular section. You went to Zagreb, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I was the junior officer trainee, which meant that I was supposed to
                    circulate through all of the different aspects of the consulate. I started out
                    in the consular section. Chips Chester was the head of the consular section.
                    Then I did administrative things. There was a guy who was named Frank Newton; he
                    was the administrative officer. Then I did political economic work first with
                    George Jaeger and then Sam Lee who was the number two political economic
                    officer. Actually Joe Godson was the consul general there first and he was a
                    fascinating person. He was an ex-labor person who came in through the AFL-CIO.
                    He was labor attache in London and labor attache in Belgrade and then was consul
                    general in Zagreb. He had very good Serbo-Croatian and was on good terms with
                    Vladimir Bakorich, the local head of the party and one of the key associates of
                    Tito's. Then the second consul general while I was there was Carl Sommerlatte
                    who had been in the Soviet business before that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there, it was still '62 when you
                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: No, by this time we're in February of '63, by that time we had been
                    through the A100 course then on the Yugoslav desk waiting for the language
                    course to begin. The language course began in the fall, took 16 weeks of
                    language and then out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the sort of political economic situation that you
                        safrom the Zagreb perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, in the first place when we arrived there it was the deep freeze. I
                    don't know if you remember the winter of '63 in Central Europe, but it was the
                    coldest winter on record. It was so cold that we took the train from Paris to go
                    to pick up our cars in Germany and all of the heating in the cars froze, the
                    pipes burst, the toilets were frozen. My wife was pregnant at the time and we
                    were also cold and I think Tom Niles and Peggy and I all sort of huddled
                    together for warmth in one lower bunk in the railroad car. When we got to Zagreb
                    all of the coal was frozen into the railroad cars. So, there was no coal
                    available to heat anything, so the Palace Hotel which we stayed initially, the
                    waiters were all wearing overcoats and getting out of bed itself was a hazardous
                    operation. We finally moved to the Esplanade Hotel which did have heating, but
                    that of course, cast a pall on the whole economy because the industry had come
                    to a grinding halt and food was short and all that. It was a rather atypical
                    introduction to the place. It was actually not so much different than being
                    there in '56 in the first place although a lot of progress had been made in the
                    interim.</p>
                <p>Politically, I would say, this was before the Croatian cultural revolution or
                    whatever you want to call it was before the crowd around Bakarich made a play
                    for more political and economic autonomy. Although they still complained
                    bitterly about the fact that the products of Croatia and Slovenia, the
                    hardworking honest toilers of Zagreb and Ljubljana were sent down to develop the
                    backward Serbs, the good for nothing Albanians and all that. There was strong
                    tension in the air about the fact that they were essentially paying to develop
                    the rest of the country. When the summer came the economy was no so bad. There
                    were no shortages of food or anything like that. There was a strong secret
                    police element in most things. They kept a pretty close watch on various signs
                    of restlessness among the Croatian natives. The Cardinal at that time, of course
                    the Croatians are always Catholic during the war period the Cardinal had been
                    notoriously pro-Ustasi and pro-Nazi and this was the successor who was there
                    then who was quite nationalist. I would go to the churches around town and
                    listen to the kinds of things people would say from the pulpit particularly from
                    the Franciscan Monastery. It was really quite nationalist in what they had to
                    say about the Serbs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say nationalist, you mean Croatian nationalist
                        aopposed to Yugoslav nationalist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: No, I mean Croatian nationalist. This was, the Croatianthought of
                    themselves as the 1,000 year culture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Instead of being 500 years under the Turkish yoke, which
                        is whaI got in Belgrade?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>BARRY: Right. There were still lots of remnants of the Austrian/Hungarian
                    monarchy there because Croatia had been part of Hungary in the pre-1919
                    federation. There were still a lot of countesses and counts who were left over
                    from that period who were more attached to that sort of north-south axis rather
                    than to the forced marriage with the Serbs. It was still worth your life to
                    employ a Serb and a Croat together in your household. I guess it was Mrs. Peggy
                    Beam, the ambassador's wife when they were there earlier. The Serb and the Croat
                    in the household were after each other with knives and things like that. There
                    was a lot of nationalist particularism, but on the other hand, most of the
                    people we knew thought of themselves first and foremost as Yugoslavs. Peggy
                    stayed there to have our first child and we had a Yugoslav doctor, a Dalmatian
                    who could not have been more pro-Yugoslav and put down the Croatian
                    particularism and all that. I mention that simply because we're in touch with
                    the same person today and you couldn't imagine a more ardent Croatian
                    nationalist who has nothing good to say about anything except Tudjman. So, it
                    certainly was not evident to any of us then that this was, that the problems of
                    history and nationalism were ever going to come back to the degree that they had
                    during the World War II. People were still getting over the experiences of World
                    War II, some of the horrors of the death camps and the terrible things the
                    Croats and Serbs did to each other in that period. I think the general
                    impression among us all was that this was an antagonism that would not ever come
                    back and that although there were still some remnants of these old feelings
                    leftover from the 1940s and before, that federation would last.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in your work, did you have any, can you talk a
                        biabout consular cases or what type of consular work you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, a lot of this was kind of similar to Lawrence Durell, if you've
                    read, as I'm sure you have “esprit de corps” and some of those stories he wrote
                    about old Yugoslavia. One of my first consular cases that I can recall was that
                    I heard from a truly irate American who was staying in the Palace Hotel that I
                    had to come over there right away to deal with the situation that had developed
                    around his wife. I got there and found a huge mob scene going on. I began to
                    sort it out and figure out what happened. What had happened was that this woman
                    had been preparing to go to bed and in the process of doing so was in her
                    bathrobe and had put a lot of pink plastic curlers in her hair. She then went
                    into the WC [water closet] and sat on the toilet and in reaching up to flush it,
                    pulled the overhead chain that caused the water closet to fall on her head. This
                    upset her husband, who called the management of the hotel and raised an ungodly
                    squawk. The management of the hotel reacted by calling everybody. They had a
                    doctor, they had the local tourist board, they had the police and they had of
                    all things the plumber who had originally installed the plumbing in the Palace
                    Hotel back in the time of the Austro Hungarian Empire. They're all in there
                    yelling at the top of their lungs, the poor woman was suffering some kind of
                    concussion from having this thing fall on her head. I managed to finally clear
                    all these people out and work out what the story was. The story from the hotel
                    was, it was not their fault. This facility was installed in the good old Austro
                    Hungarian days. This was the man who did it, he's a well-known craftsman, the
                    best materials were used. She must have mistreated the facility by somehow
                    pulling it at a strange angle from which you probably would have had to stand on
                    the toilet itself and pull it over here and subjected it to this unpredictable
                    strain which caused the thing to fall on her head. We're not going to charge you
                    for it. Otherwise, we'd naturally make her pay for repairing it. So, this led to
                    a long negotiation after which the final outcome was that she was allowed to
                    depart the hotel without having to pay for it. She stayed there that night, but
                    that was one kind of tourist mishap.</p>
                <p>Another was a very large woman, an American citizen of Greek origin who in fact
                    spoke nothing but Greek. She was so large, in fact, that she could not turn
                    around inside a train car which had caused her to... While she was going to go
                    to the bathroom in the train at the time the train was passing through the large
                    tunnel that goes between Austria, or Italy I guess it is and Slovenia... But
                    this was a dark tunnel. The lights in the train kept going on and off and as she
                    thought she was backing up into the WC on the train. She in fact was backing out
                    of the train into the tunnel. She found herself lying there in the tunnel
                    bruised and broken here and there. We had to go and retrieve her. She again, did
                    not speak anything but Greek and we didn't speak any Greek except my consular
                    assistant spoke some classical Greek. So, classical Greek and modern Greek
                    exchanged, this woman had then to be placed in a very large caissonlike cast
                    that went sort of head to toe which further made her difficult to move around.
                    As I recall we had to try to find a plane which was landing in Zagreb that could
                    fly her to wherever she wanted to go that had an exceptionally large hatch so
                    that she could be moved into the plane.</p>
                <p>I guess another memorable occasion was when Jackie Kennedy visited, this was
                    after John F. Kennedy's assassination which I'm sure you've experienced also. It
                    had a terrific impact.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really did. I mean I was abroad and I came back the
                        next day and I was on leave with my wife and all the flags were half mast
                        and going across the customs guards, I mean they were weeping and it was
                        something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>We had so many candles put in front of the consulate that it broke the glass in
                    the front of the consulate and there were people out there all night praying and
                    things like that. It had a very deep and lasting impact. I remember it was our
                    pediatrician who told us about Kennedy's death, which we had trouble absorbing
                    at the time. Anyhow, it was several months after that that Mrs. Kennedy came to
                    Yugoslavia on Charles Wrightsman's yacht. I was detailed to sort of go along as
                    escort officer or helpmate because she did have the Secret Service with her, not
                    on the yacht, but in our little Volkswagen which we sort of bounced along the
                    coast while Mrs. Kennedy and Lee Radizwill were on the yacht. In fact, she
                    didn't get off except once in Dubrovnik and we joined her in Dubrovnik. They had
                    kept it very secret that she was there and didn't want to be bothered by
                    anybody. But the word got out and there were thousands of people in the streets
                    in Dubrovnik trying to get a glimpse of her. In the event, she walked around the
                    city a little bit. She said she couldn't stand the crowds of people and went
                    back and spent time on the boat with her afterwards. She was talking about how
                    she didn't mind being the center of attention when her husband was alive, but
                    now that he was dead, it was too much to have to put up with all this crowd
                    scene. So, it was a fascinating time to be able to have an opportunity to spend
                    some time with her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did visas cause any particular problems for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Oh, yes. Well, visas are always a problem. The idea was that people were
                    not bona fide non-immigrants and indeed many of them were not. In many ways
                    there were little areas of Croatia in particular which had closer ties with the
                    United States than they did with the surrounding countryside in Yugoslavia.
                    These were people whose ancestors had immigrated long ago or whether the husband
                    had left and gone to sea or something like that, hadn't been heard of for a long
                    time, they depended on social security payments often. Other times things
                    pension checks had been sent from the United States and we'd go to verify these
                    social security recipients were still alive. We'd go back into these isolated
                    villages in the Lika and you had to walk several miles from the nearest road. My
                    consular assistant and I would show up and people would assume that we were
                    relatives from the United States and they were all dressed in clothes that had
                    been sent to them from the U.S. It was that kind of disjunctive economy, so
                    naturally because so many people had ties in the United States, most of the
                    people who came for non-immigrant visas were considered to be ineligible.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were working in the political section, what type
                        of things were you doing? What sort of contacts did both you have and Joe
                        Godson have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, Joe of course, had very good contacts with the top political
                    leadership in Croatia. Bakarich, who was the head of the Croatian communist
                    party, and other people who were in charge of the government there. He could get
                    some good information from them about what some of the problems were, some of
                    the disagreements were between the federal government and the Croatians. They
                    were not shy about complaining about the fact that the economy was being run
                    badly, that they weren't getting their fair share and things like that. I spent
                    more of my time covering what was the beginnings of the sort of intellectual
                    basis for Croatian particularism which was a group around a magazine called
                    Praxis. This was a philosophical journal that got started about '64 I guess and
                    the people around them were people at the university and people in the social
                    sciences who were basically in favor of more pluralism and in favor or reducing
                    the dominance of the Serbs, sort of smarting under Serbian dominance. This later
                    became a cause celebre after I had left when Tito decided to crack down on this
                    tendency of Croatian intellectuals. I spent a lot of time also following what
                    was going on in the religious circles. I got to know some of the Catholic clergy
                    there and spent some time up in Slovenia, too because that was part of our
                    consular district calling on people and talking to people there. They had a
                    similar kind of intellectual quasi rebellion going on in Slovenia at the time.
                    But this was, these were not big issues at this point. I don't really remember
                    what the differences were between the Belgrade embassy and Zagreb consulate at
                    the time. I know that Joe Godson in particular, Joe asserted his right to send
                    in reports without clearing them with the political section in Belgrade and I
                    think that caused some unhappiness at the time because it tended to differ from
                    the view in Belgrade about some of these issues. I guess also we spent a fair
                    amount of time on commercial things, for example, the annual Zagreb fair which
                    always had large numbers of American companies present and Tito always attended
                    and things like that. It was a time when the ambassador always came up in
                    Belgrade. In fact, I remember the first one of those occasions was one in which
                    Ambassador and Mrs. Kennan came up from Belgrade and we all went to a play given
                    in Serbo Croatian based on Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh which in Serbo
                    Croatian turns out to be as I think I will never forget I Leder Dodje. O'Neill
                    has got a great deal of dialect in his English language and it was all
                    faithfully translated into incomprehensible Serbo-Croatian and it also was quite
                    long. I think it went on for four hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If this is the one I think it is, the New York critics
                        said “ThIceman Cometh, the critic goeth.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, that's right except the critic in this case was my wife who was
                    something like eight months pregnant who was sitting there on this hard bench
                    with the Kennans and other such dignitaries. She didn't feel as if she could go,
                    so we sat through all that at the time. But there was also a good deal going on
                    in the cultural scene in Zagreb. The Croatians all naturally feeling that they
                    were cultural and the Serbs weren't, but whether it was, they did have very good
                    music there, they did have a good opera. They had a lot of theater and the
                    theater was sometimes, it was often I would say of the read between the lines
                    type, so there was something to be gained from trying to interpret what was
                    going through peoples minds by the plays they showed and the kinds of statements
                    were being made by those plays.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for how the people in Croatia and
                        Slovenilook at the Soviets at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: As the good friends of the Serbs and therefore, not to be trusted too
                    much, I guess. This was still of course in the period of tension between the
                    Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. I think it was around '65 if I recall correctly
                    when Khrushchev came to Belgrade and there was a plane crash.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a plane crash at Dedinje, I think, of some
                        Soviet military people who had taken part in the “liberation of Yugoslavia”
                        and the whole plane just came in and hit the hill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, as usual there's always conspiracy theories and there are conspiracy
                    theories around that as well, why did it happen. But I think it's fair to say
                    that the Croats were always more in favor of the break with the Soviet Union
                    than perhaps the Serbs were. They believed that trade with the Soviet Union was
                    always to their disadvantage. If they were helping to subsidize the Serbs they
                    were also helping to subsidize the Russians. There was a Russian consulate in
                    Zagreb. There were a number of others. There was Austria, there was French,
                    there was British, there was Italian and all that, but the Russians I guess kept
                    a pretty low profile at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Slovenia play much of a role as far as you all were
                        concerneor were you pretty well hooked to Croatia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, we spent some time in Slovenia. We did a fair amount of commercial
                    work and we'd go traveling around with some of the firms, Sloveniales and there
                    were joint ventures. There were joint ventures between Dow and INA at the time,
                    which was just getting started. There was the petrochemical industry. There was
                    some, there were a number of American companies that were interested. Most of
                    them were interested in Slovenia and Croatia it seems to me. We spent a lot of
                    our time pursing those, but I think in terms of the political role that Slovenia
                    played, it played it more in Belgrade than it did in Zagreb. We'd go up and
                    visit some of the players in Slovenia who used to sort of commute back and forth
                    to Belgrade.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I remember assuming that they were omni present in the sense of
                    tapping our phones and probably wiring the consulate, but I don't recall any
                    particular incidents of harassment. This was a period of U.S. Yugoslav relations
                    were pretty close where we had an active PL480 program, a military training
                    program, all those kinds of things, so I don't recall the security people were
                    heavy handed.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>BARRY: '65 and in those days getting into the cadre of Soviet specialists was
                    kind of difficult and I guess the reason that I ended up there was because our
                    consul general, our second consul general in Zagreb was Karl Sommerlatte. Carl
                    had been in Moscow and guess he and Mac Toon had served together at one time or
                    another. As I was beginning to think about my next assignment, Karl wrote to
                    Mac, who was Director of EUR/SOV, on my behalf. In fact I guess the same thing
                    happened to Tom Niles who was in Belgrade because we were both junior officers
                    in the same class and we both got sent back to work in Soviet affairs. I worked
                    in the bilateral section and Tom worked in the economic section.</p>

                <p>BARRY: The key there was to grab the brass ring that would have provided you with
                    the softest and nicest assignment in the Foreign Service which was to go on from
                    Soviet affairs to take advanced language training at the U.S. Army Field
                    Detachment R in Garmisch, Germany. When we both arrived there we both asked
                    well, how do we get on this particular bus? The answer was well you take early
                    morning lessons every in season for two years and get your Russian up to a three
                    and you can go do Garmisch. We religiously did that in addition to working on
                    the desk. We went off every morning and did our early morning Russian across the
                    river in the old Foreign Service Institute.</p>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>BARRY: I was the junior person on the bilateral section. The office director was
                    Mac Toon and I started out sort of doing pick up, answering congressional
                    letters. The person I worked most closely with was Virginia James who was a
                    tradition in the Foreign Service herself. I think she had joined the State
                    Department in about 1924. She'd come to Washington and had worked in the
                    government during the First World War and then she was one of the early people,
                    I guess she was originally a secretary, but she developed a strong interest in
                    the Soviet Union and this was the old office of East European Affairs before it
                    was divided up into East Europe and the Soviet Union and of course, before we
                    had relations with the USSR. She had kept a long record of dealings on behalf of
                    political prisoners, dissidents, American citizens who had gotten in trouble one
                    way or another in the Soviet Union and had no relations. She had been present in
                    1934 when the relationship was finally opened as the result of the
                    Roosevelt-Litvinov agreements. In fact I think she had something to do with
                    having typed up one of the agreements or something like that, but she had been
                    involved with in particular religious dissidents. People like Alexander Dolgun
                    who was an American Jesuit who had been in prison for many years and she had
                    carried all his correspondence forward. She drafted all the notes and so that
                    was my sort of initial job, working with her on trying to get people out of the
                    USSR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you just explain to somebody who is not maybe
                        familiar the language? When you say bilateral relations? What is that as
                        compared to what is not bilateral?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: The Office of Soviet Affairs was divided in that time to four different
                    sections. There was one office director. Then there were bilateral relations
                    which had to do essentially with the strictly relationships between the U.S. and
                    the USSR. It dealt with consular matters; it dealt with things like property. It
                    dealt with things like bilateral negotiations on a consular convention which is
                    one of the things that I worked on later on. In essence, anything that only had
                    two parties involved, the U.S. and the USSR. There was a multilateral section,
                    which dealt with things like arms control and the international conferences
                    which the USSR, and the U.S. were concerned. The multilateral section worked on
                    UN issues, so that section was actually involved in the broad range of political
                    issues. There was an economic section which dealt with trade and trade
                    relationships and the various kinds of restrictions on U.S. trade with the USSR
                    and there was a cultural affairs or exchanges section which was what handled the
                    things like people to people exchanges, the international research exchanges for
                    Fulbrights and helped to regulate the two way flow of scientific and technical
                    change and all that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe during this '65 to '67 period
                        ourelations with the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>BARRY: They were, I would say, not at rock bottom, but they were far from
                    prospering. There were a lot of espionage cases at that time on both sides. That
                    was something that our section handled. The relationship was getting ready to
                    expand in the sense that we had an interest in reopening the consulate, which we
                    used to have in Leningrad or St. Petersburg. The Russians were interested in
                    opening a consulate in San Francisco. That was an issue on which I worked. We
                    were negotiating a U.S./USSR consular convention which provided for rules for
                    dealing with American citizens or Soviet citizens for that matter who were in
                    trouble in one another's country provided rights of access to arrested citizens
                    and the rights of consular officers in each other's country to certain kinds of
                    immunities and so forth. That was quite controversial because there were many in
                    the congress who felt that opening a new consulate would simply be a new outlet
                    for Soviet espionage in the U.S. We argued that we needed a new window on the
                    USSR more than the Russians needed a new window since they already had the large
                    relationship in New York. This was something in which Mac Toon was very
                    interested because he felt that it was important to get more posts in the USSR.
                    We were dealing with property issues also. This was the time when we began to
                    negotiate for new embassy sites in both countries. This was a very long lasting
                    negotiation I guess still continues to this day in terms of the new facilities
                    that we had built or are still building in Moscow. This was something that I was
                    responsible for later on in my time on the desk. This was where I got introduced
                    to the fact that the compartmentalization of our security business is sometimes
                    self-defeating. I did not have the kinds of clearances that would have been
                    required in order to be fully apprized of what some of the concerns on the parts
                    of the other agencies may have been. For example, one of the things that we
                    agreed to and I was responsible for agreeing to was allowing the Russians to
                    take a lease on a summer place that was around Berryville, Virginia. I had
                    checked this out with the FBI and others at the time and it came back okay, so
                    we told the Russians to go ahead. Only after that did I find that this
                    particular site was located on top of a sensitive relocation site for the U.S.
                    government which none of the people I was dealing with in the U.S. government
                    knew about. But it turned out that the Russians were moving there for their
                    summer holidays. It came out in all the press that here is this thing that is
                    built over one of the air exhausts or near one of the air exhausts to one of
                    these big old government relocation sites. We went through a long discussion
                    with people about the location of what is the current Russian embassy in Mt.
                    Alto. It wasn't the first place we ended up. We looked around at several places
                    including some of the old estates in and around downtown D.C. All of which were
                    objected to for some reason or other by local neighborhood groups. We couldn't
                    get the zoning change to do this. We ended up for a while there it was going to
                    be at the old National Bureau of Standards where so many embassies are now
                    located. That turned out not to be feasible because of the fact that they wanted
                    to divide it into smaller plots to provide more sites for other embassies. Mt.
                    Alto was a government property and again we went through the process of checking
                    it out with people. I think all of us who were dealing with this weren't fully
                    clued in as to what the problems may have been. I think in fact this was not
                    finally concluded during the time I was there, but some time afterwards. That
                    whole issue and the conditions of construction and who would do what in terms of
                    embassy construction on both sides is an issue that was important and
                    frustrating because every time you thought that a solution was in your grasp it
                    sort of disappeared again which it still does to this day I guess.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might point out for the record the problem with the Mt.
                        Alto site became very clear from the papers and all was that it dominates
                        the skyline of Washington where with line of sight one can eavesdrop on the
                        Pentagon and everybody else. That wouldn't be the type of knowledge or
                        abilities that would get to a desk officer. It was the sort of thing that
                        would be kept from you. Only our people and the KGB knew what they could do
                        I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, there was an interagency committee on internal security which was
                    one of the committees left over from the Eisenhower period and that contained
                    representatives of all the different intelligence agencies and these decisions,
                    in fact, were cleared with this committee, but evidently the people who were
                    looking at it were not the people who were defending against electronic
                    intelligence, but the people who just wanted to keep an eye on the Russians
                    themselves and this was a pretty good site to do it from. There was
                    specialization even in the internal security agency about who does what to
                    whom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you find dealing with say prisoners and consular
                        cases of people and all during this '65 to '67 period? What was the Soviet
                        attitude? Were you able to say come on why don't we settle these things and
                        just get these people out of your hair or was it difficult?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Of course this had been going on for years ever since 1934 when the
                    relations were first established and some of the things in the
                    Roosevelt-Litvinov agreement provided for various kinds of things like freedom
                    of religion for people living in each other's country and things like that. The
                    Soviets were never very well disposed to all of this, but they were quite
                    accustomed to getting notes from us especially on the occasion of any kind of
                    high level meeting where our officials would normally have sort of tucked away
                    in their pocket a list of people that the Congress was concerned with or a list
                    of diplomatic notes that had been sent in the past. We made quite a regular
                    practice of sending notes to the Soviet foreign ministry on behalf of prisoners
                    of one kind or another or American citizens or people who we claimed were
                    American citizens and they claimed were not dual citizens and questions of
                    access to arrested Americans and things like that. We dealt essentially with the
                    consular division of the Soviet embassy here on occasion it came to the
                    attention of Ambassador Dobrynin when he would be called in by somebody or the
                    DCM who was at that time Yuli Vorontsov, who is now their ambassador to the
                    UN.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>You know, every once in a while you would get satisfaction on a case or two, but
                    it was not what you would call a wholesale kind of operation, it was a retail
                    operation. Some cases and they took a very strict view of what was espionage and
                    what was subversion and things like that and could not easily be talked out of
                    some of that. Of course, there were a lot of people who were dual citizens. A
                    lot of people who had gone back to Russia during the 1930s, who had come here in
                    the '20s and '30s and then had gone back during the Depression and were
                    legitimately dual citizens. The purges had then picked up and they had been sent
                    off to one camp or another. A lot of them were in Mordovia, which is where a big
                    chain of camps were where foreigners were dealt with. There were some very
                    interesting books written during that period. For example, I mentioned Alexander
                    Dolgun, who finally got out, who was a Jesuit priest and a book was written
                    about him which had a lot to say about life in the camps in the '30s and '40s.
                    Virginia James, as I say, had an absolutely remarkable memory and had a file
                    cabinet full of all these cases going back to the beginning of time. She was the
                    one I think who told me about the time that they moved from the Old Executive
                    Office Building to the then new State Department, that is the old section of the
                    State Department was our new home after that. I guess it was Walter Stoessel who
                    had been the desk officer or the office director as it was and in the middle of
                    the afternoon there was a truck that pulled up and they took all the safes and
                    got them into the back of the truck. They issued Walter a shotgun and rode over
                    to the new State Department and unloaded everything there. So, she had an
                    absolutely wonderful memory of all these things. She died rather recently about
                    four or five years ago at the age of 95 or 98 or something like that. She was
                    living out in Fredericksburg, Virginia. In fact I wrote something about her in
                    the Foreign Service Journal in the '80s, something about her activities and her
                    wonderful concern for all these people.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, if you're talking about espionage, yes. If you're talking about
                    things where there were direct concerns of the KGB and we had one of their
                    people or any time we arrested one of their people you could pretty well expect
                    them to find somebody on our side to arrest. Frederick Barghorn is an ideal
                    example of this perfectly innocent example. Barghorn was a Yale professor and I
                    guess this was in the early part of the Kennedy administration. It was before I
                    got into this. He was there on one of the early academic exchanges and we had
                    picked up a real honest to God Soviet spy, somebody then came up to Barghorn on
                    the street with a rolled up newspaper and handed it to him. He was pounced on by
                    the KGB. The rolled up newspaper contained military secrets and so Barghorn was
                    put in jail. Kennedy raised a hell of a squawk about it because this was clearly
                    a case of purely doing this for purposes of developing an exchange. In the event
                    they backed down and let Barghorn go. I forget the exact outcome as far as the
                    Russians. It may be that the Russian was not prosecuted because the U.S.
                    Attorney didn't feel there was enough evidence, but it was not, we were told at
                    the time, a deal. Usually when it came down to espionage cases there was some
                    kind of an exchange. Then later on when it got to dissidents there such as
                    Sakharhov and others.</p>

                <p>BARRY: Oh, yes, it was a very sticky issue altogether. In fact, I think it was
                    ratified during my time on the desk. The sticking points had to do with rights
                    of access and notification. We insisted on a time certain, three to five days,
                    for notification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about arrest cases?</hi>

                <p>BARRY: We're talking about American citizens. What we wanted to be sure of is
                    that we had the right to go into a jail and see the person and talk to them. In
                    the Barghorn case for example, which was the immediate precedent to that which
                    caused some of the concern led to the consular treaty Barghorn was held for
                    weeks without any American having access to him. That was the case under Soviet
                    law in general. You could be held without access to a lawyer, relatives, or
                    anything like that as long as the case was still in the hands of the procurator
                    general, that is, the person doing the investigation. It was only when the
                    decision was made about whether to bring the person to trial or not that he was
                    allowed access to a lawyer. So, we were very anxious to have this pinned down in
                    terms of I think it was one to three days for notification and three to five
                    days for access. The Russians wanted a much more flexible kind of terminology
                    like within a reasonable period of time and the shortest possible time. We
                    negotiated about that for a very long time. The Russians wanted to have in the
                    convention provisos for opening posts and we did not want that because we
                    realized that it would make it difficult to get through the congress. We wanted
                    to have it strictly on the basis that this is something that enhances our
                    ability to protect American citizens in the USSR and represents a real step
                    forward in terms of how the Russians can treat our people. It guess it was Bill
                    Shinn, who was then head of the consular section in Moscow. He was then engaged
                    with a case of another American, Newcomb Mott, who was kind of an innocent
                    abroad who had gone up to Kirkenes in the very northern part of where Norway and
                    the USSR meet in the Arctic and for some strange reason and crossed the border.
                    Well, I guess it reminds me of this young American who just swam naked across
                    the Yalu River from China into North Korea and had to be released and then
                    committed suicide later. Actually the cases are rather parallel. This young man
                    simply walked across the border up around Kirkenes and ended up in a border town
                    which at that time Soviets had opened to Norwegians to come in and go shopping
                    at certain fixed times. They bought them in in busses and things like that. This
                    kid just wandered into the town and he was picked up and charged with espionage.
                    We were not allowed access to him. They tried to trade him for a Soviet spy - I
                    think, a UN person we had picked up. We wouldn't have anything to do with it. He
                    was being transported from, I guess Murmansk, to Moscow where he was going to be
                    interrogated further and tried, and he died under somewhat mysterious conditions
                    on the train. I think it's pretty clear what had happened was he had cut his own
                    wrists and committed suicide, but there were also claims at the time that he was
                    murdered by the Soviets, but we had not access to him and that was another issue
                    that was very prominent then. I remember Bill Shinn at that time made several
                    trips to Murmansk, which is where he was being held and had a lot to do with the
                    case. A book was written about that, too, charging as usual that the embassy and
                    the State Department didn't do enough for this young man and claiming that he
                    was murdered. That was another reason that caused us to want to have specific
                    guarantees about what we needed to do in terms of U.S. citizens. The FBI didn't
                    like the consular convention because they didn't want Soviet consulates here in
                    this country. I can't remember what position the CIA took. I think they were
                    probably in favor of it because it allows them to have more posts in the USSR.
                    But, it was fought hard over in the congress and it did win the necessary
                    two-thirds majority and I think was ratified in '67, '66.</p>

                        thRevolution or something that we're still trying to get out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Actually that's sort of another story because I ended up being the first
                    person who was opening up the first consulate in the USSR. One of the first
                    places we looked at was our old embassy in St. Petersburg, which is now a
                    marriage palace. It's probably a brothel by now or something that makes money.
                    As it turns out, it was too small for us and it was in a poor location in terms
                    of our desire to have a free standing building. It's still there. It's quite
                    elegant. Angus Ward, who was in Moscow in '34, went up to reopen the building
                    and found all the old files still there and transferred them back to Washington.
                    Of course, at one time we had a whole bunch of consulates. We had consulates in
                    Vladivostok and along the Trans-Siberian Railway and things like that all to
                    which came to an end after the Revolution or some of them were reopened during
                    World War II for Lend-Lease and then closed down again. But we were eager in
                    particular to get into Leningrad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, while you were on the desk, obviously you were sort
                        of the new boy on the block with your ears wide open and listening, what was
                        your impression of the Soviet hands at that time? This was sort of the
                        elite.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Mac Toon was the dean of the Soviet hands at that time and he later went
                    on to be ambassador in Moscow. He had a long experience and I would say a
                    justifiably low opinion of Soviet politics. He was very I would say rough edged
                    in his feelings with the Soviets and he'd made no secret of it to them. When he
                    finally was nominated as ambassador the Soviets took an awfully long time giving
                    him agreement, but they finally did after they were told that this was whom they
                    better take. There were a lot of other people on the desk some of whom like Vlad
                    Toumanoff had come from Russian background, others like Paul Cook having been an
                    academic expert and worked on this for a long time. The deputy director was Jim
                    Pratt, who later went on to be political counselor in Moscow at the time that I
                    was there. I guess the multilateral section had many of the stars of the then
                    Soviet field. Kempton Jenkins and Bill Luers were there. Generally there what
                    they had was people who were experts in some other part of the world and the
                    Soviet Union at the same time so they had China hands and Middle East people and
                    things like that who were also doing an apprenticeship in Soviet affairs. Always
                    a good group of people, actually not so many of them continued on the Soviet
                    business for one reason or another. Caroll Woods was the head of the bilateral
                    section. I don't think he ever went back to Moscow. The exchanges section had
                    been before a part of the bureau of cultural affairs and then the bureau of
                    cultural affairs had split up and it was divided up into an office of East
                    European exchanges which dealt with Eastern Europe. The Soviet part of it got
                    attached to the political desk.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impression when you were on the desk of the
                        Khrushchev leadership and I think probably while you were there he was
                        deposed, wasn't he? How did that sort of hit what people were talking
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I'm trying to remember. If such a major event happened it's strange that I
                    wouldn't have been involved in it somehow at the time or made a bigger
                    impression on me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somehow I have the feeling that it happened... I was in
                        Belgrade and left there in June of '67. I'm quite sure I remember Khrushchev
                        being on the outs. Did you get any feel for Khrushchev?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: This was the time when this was the post missile crisis detente period
                    when there were a lot of things going on in terms of new directions in arms
                    control beginnings and things like that. I'm going to have to refresh my memory
                    about all this because it doesn't I guess my nose was too close to the
                    grindstone to have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, fair enough I mean all of us were doing things and I
                        mean this was how, you know, how any office operates. Then did you get on to
                        the Garmisch-Partenkirchen gravy train or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I did. I guess the other thing that I did during that period on two or
                    three separate occasions was to go up to the UN General Assembly to be sort of
                    general handyman, note taker and things like that and to help deal with Soviet
                    affairs from that angle in a very minor way. In fact I remember the first year I
                    was up there I was told by the political counselor at the U.S. Mission to the UN
                    since I was a Soviet hand I ought to go out to the airport and meet all these
                    distinguished Soviet experts who were coming in to be there for Rusk's
                    discussions with Gromyko. I took one of the mission's big cars out to the
                    airport and I was picking up Tommy Thompson and Chip Bohlen. These were names
                    that were familiar to me, but I couldn't recognize one of them if they stepped
                    on me. I went out there in my best meeting and greeting style and said to the
                    wrong one, “Hello, Ambassador Bohlen. My name is Barry.” He looked at me and
                    said, “I'm Thompson, he's Bohlen.” I felt about better later on because after
                    serving as a section chief for a year in Thompson's embassy I went down the
                    elevator with him on his last day there and he obviously didn't know who I was.
                    I guess that in those days of course there was always a bilateral with the
                    Russians and they always brought the ambassador back from Moscow, Bohlen was at
                    that time the special assistant to the secretary on Soviet affairs. This was the
                    early times of the Jewish Defense League and all the activities of the mission
                    to the UN and there were these various other issues going on at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Anyhow after two years of laboring in the vineyards, both Tom Niles and I did
                    succeed being sent to the Garmisch gravy train, which was as advertised a very
                    nice experience. The first thing we did when we got there was to take a six-week
                    trip through Eastern Europe and the USSR. The army set this up, of course they
                    have all these foreign area specialization programs and in most of them they
                    indeed send the military officers to the country in which they are specializing,
                    but that wasn't possible in the USSR. So, they created this institute made up
                    largely of people who had recently defected from the USSR who had come back from
                    the Vlasov armies or who had gotten out in the '20s and '30s and had been in
                    Europe and were attracted to this place. Because they came from different
                    periods of immigration, some of them came from the KGB, some of them came from
                    the GRU, some of them came from the foreign ministry. They didn't get along very
                    well. Some of them were Chechens; they didn't get along very well with each
                    other. It was a place where they carried out all their arguments in Russian so
                    you were forced to work hard on your Russian and there were usually three or
                    four of us State Department, USIA, NSA people who were there for each class.</p>
                <p>The military program was two years. We did one year and as a familiarization tour
                    we went to, I guess we went through Intourist as a tourist group, we got
                    Intourist guides and all that, but we started out through Czechoslovakia and
                    Poland and then into the Baltic States and to St. Petersburg and to Moscow and
                    then we took the train and plane all across the USSR and spent four or five days
                    on the Trans-Siberian Railroad and then came back through the southern tier,
                    through Kiev and through Romania and Bulgaria. So, it gave us a good, if gray
                    initial look because it all took place in October and November. It was very hard
                    to get into a kind of conversational situation with Russians because the
                    Intourist guides knew we were from the so-called famous spy school and were
                    eager to isolate us as much as possible, but still wanted our money. On the
                    Trans-Siberian for example, you'd get thrown willy nilly into discussions with
                    Russians. It was fascinating, sort of a first impression which was one of great
                    hardship at the time. We thought Poland was pretty grim, but when we got to the
                    USSR and began to look at places like Bratsk and Novosibirsk and places like
                    that we realized what a gray and dull life it could be. The Russians were
                    fascinating and I have enjoyed Russians ever since. Of course we got to know a
                    lot of Russians in Garmisch, one of the more recent emigres, I guess had been a
                    defector who'd been, had something to do with the military, but he was somebody
                    in his thirties and very critical of course of everything he saw around him
                    among the Americans. It turned out later he was probably a plant because he
                    redefected after being there for a couple of years. He wrote a series of
                    articles about the spy school, which greatly exaggerated its abilities. I
                    remember he came over to the house one day and said something about, “Well, you
                    Americans are crazy about guns. I look around and I see all your children are
                    playing with guns. It's a violent society.” I was saying that this was healthy
                    because it taught you how to argue in Russia with Russians. Just at that point
                    my three-year-old son came walking into the room with a new Christmas present
                    which was a big gun, so big he could barely carry it.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>There was also a very fascinating couple there who were from the old NTS which
                    was a sort of left-wing populist anti-Bolshevik group that had a lot of
                    connections among intellectuals in Russia. They had something to do with
                    Sinyausky and Daniel and they introduced us to the Russian writers of that time
                    and made us read them in Russian. That really gave us an excellent introduction
                    into the underground and dissident literature of that time. So, that by the time
                    we got there we not only had picked up about Russian military terminology, but
                    also, were able to discuss intellectual questions pretty well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the American military related to this
                        part of the training or was this more I mean did you kind of divide yourself
                        up into the military in wanting to know how to say, “Take me to your 155 mm
                        canons” while you at the same time tell me about your intellectual.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, it was interesting. The army of course, is very different from the
                    navy or the air force. The army does have a genuine and successful foreign area
                    specialization program and they do usually use the people who graduate from
                    these programs as their attaches and later. In serving with people who had done
                    this I have much more respect for the army attaches, not that they aren't all
                    good people, but that the people who went through this FAS program were
                    basically head and shoulders above others in terms of their knowledge and
                    breadth and interest about the country. Yes, there were some people in the group
                    who were nuts and bolts people. Of course, in the FAS program you maintain your
                    original specialty. Some of them were intelligence specialists, others were
                    combat arms specialists. This was the Vietnam period, so a lot of them were
                    either coming out of Vietnam or were going into Vietnam. In fact one of the sad
                    things about the school was that so many of the people who were trained there
                    never went on to do anything in the Soviet area. They ended up going back to
                    Vietnam or getting involved in other things. I think that these were all people
                    who were genuinely interested in the USSR. This was at the time when this was
                    considered to be the main national security challenge so it was more than the
                    location of the nearest howitzer that they were interested in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I interviewed somebody not too long ago about the army,
                        the National Defense University who said that he was told before he went and
                        he said it was true, he said that you can characterize the air force as
                        being the most non-intellectual group of this. The navy as being really
                        rather narrow as far as what they knew and the army would be just like us
                        speaking just like us in the Foreign Service in a way with a broader
                        view.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>BARRY: I think the army does a better job of giving various kinds of postgraduate
                    training. Both the navy and the air force don't promote you unless you have been
                    able to hold increasing command responsibilities. You can't get to be an admiral
                    unless you've commanded a capital ship. The amount of time that you get to spend
                    on out of area interests is considerably smaller. I went to school with the
                    newly frocked generals and admirals, this so-called Capstone course. I think
                    it's even true at that level. The NDU gets them sort of at an earlier stage, but
                    there again I thought that the army people were generally broader and more
                    inclined to have done training in areas like political science or MBAs or
                    something like that. But their foreign area specialization I think has been a
                    great success. The problem with it is that many of them get selected out before
                    they ever make colonel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, this would have been '67 and '68 you were at Garmisch?
                        Thewhere did you go in '68?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I went to Moscow. Everybody went to Moscow, that is Tom and I and George
                    Humphrey who was the third person of our class all went to Moscow together. I
                    was lucky or perhaps it was before I had worked on the consular convention for
                    Toon in Washington. I became head of the consular section when I arrived there.
                    Usually the routine was that you would spend the first year as a junior officer
                    in the consular section or in the administrative section or someplace else and
                    then go on to a second year in which you'd do something else. I got the head of
                    the consular section job. In fact I relieved classmate of mine at Dartmouth who
                    had introduced me to my wife, Sam Fry, who had been in Trieste when we were in
                    Zagreb. So, I had an interesting year in the consular section. This was not a
                    time when the consular section was terribly busy. We did have a few arrested
                    Americans as a result of the closing of the borders in Iran. Anyhow it had
                    diverted the drug smuggling trade which normally went through Kabul to Europe
                    from Afghanistan without ever going through the USSR. But, when that got shut
                    off because of Iran, these people started to fly from Kabul to Tashkent to
                    Moscow and then out to the West. The chief of police in Kabul ran the drug sales
                    business and what he would do was he would sell a consignment of drugs to
                    somebody who was going through Tashkent and would tell the people in Tashkent
                    that these people were coming and they were arrested. The drugs would come back
                    and get recycled. So, there were a lot of hapless people who were caught up in
                    this and who were in jail variously in Tashkent and then in Moscow. I went to
                    their trials in Tashkent, which led me to spend at least five or six different
                    trips down to, Tashkent using the new consular convention I got to have access
                    to them in the prisons.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I got to visit the Butyrsiaya prison in Moscow. These were prisons that were left
                    over from the time of Catherine the Great and had been very little improved
                    since and they're described in all of the various literature by people like
                    Solzhenitsyn, but it was fascinating to be able to go into these places and meet
                    the Americans and to sit through these trials. By that time I had sort of
                    developed an interest in Soviet law because that was part of what we were doing
                    with the consular convention and so forth. We had a lawyer that we picked up in
                    Tashkent who represented all these Americans going to the trials. He was Jewish
                    and got a chance to see some of the tension that existed in Central Asia between
                    the Russians and the Uzbeks or the Kazakhs or whatever of course they told you
                    it didn't exist, but of course you get down there and talk to people and they
                    would. One Uzbek told me that his son was chasing a Russian who had stolen his
                    bicycle and chased him into a Russian apartment building where he was stoned to
                    death in the courtyard of the apartment building. They never could get any of
                    the local people to develop an interest in taking this to court or anything like
                    that. We learned about how to make a sensational appeal and got all the
                    relatives and so forth to write character witnesses. Eventually I think most of
                    these people got released before their terms were out. There were some efforts
                    to trade them for espionage, people in the U.S., but of course, we weren't at
                    all interested in doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were these Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: These were people who were in the early days of sort of wandering around
                    the world. Usually they were coming back from the Far East. They'd been in
                    Thailand or some place like that. They were not professional couriers, they were
                    just young people in their twenties who had gotten into the drug culture and
                    were told that this was an easy way to make enough money to keep yourself
                    traveling around the world and just to carry this stuff along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they exist in the prison systems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I'm sure it wasn't easy. They were allowed to receive packages from
                    outside. They, I don't think any of them were physically seriously mistreated.
                    These were people, who were used to sort of living on the thin edge anyhow. They
                    were glad to get out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds sort of like the way it was in Greece. I was
                        there '70 to '74 and we had a lot of them and they were put in a Greek jail,
                        it wasn't great, but they really didn't have to do anything, they just sat
                        in the jail and contemplated their naval until eventually they were let
                        out.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>BARRY: No, these guys had to work. I think they were first imprisoned and tried
                    in Tashkent, then they were brought to Moscow and then they were transferred to
                    camps in Mordovia again where they did things like making brooms and things like
                    that. They complained that the quota was set too high. They could never get
                    enough to earn any money and that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about life in, you were in Moscow from when to when
                        now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I was there from '68 to '70. Then we were supposed to go and open
                    the consulate in Leningrad, but that was delayed for a year so I came back and
                    went back in '71 and I was there from '71 to '73, but this time in
                    Leningrad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking about the Moscow time, how was life there
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: It was very insular because there was a lot of fear of fraternization and
                    restrictions on fraternization on both sides. Of course the Russians were not
                    very easy to get to know either. The diplomatic community did a lot of
                    entertaining of each other. Insofar as one got to know Russians, these were the
                    dissidents; these were the artists mostly. This was where many people who were
                    there at that time still have paintings by Kropovnitsky or Kukhin or people like
                    that because these were the only Russians you really could meet on a regular
                    basis. You could in fact deal with some of the correspondent. Later on the
                    second year there when I was dealing with substantive things I was talking to
                    people like Evgeny Primakov, now the foreign minister, and people like that and
                    you had more to do with the foreign ministry. In that first year there were lots
                    of wonderful cultural things to do. The Taganka Theater was in its heyday and we
                    used to catch as much of the theater as we could because this was where if you
                    were watching a play about 17th century France, you were sure it was really
                    about the current Soviet Union and things like Bulgakov and Master and Margarita
                    and things like that. We could travel of course with the restriction that you
                    had to let people know in advance where you were going and they sometimes would
                    not let you go or tell you at the last minute that the place was closed. The
                    embassy had an active travel program and so we went out in addition to these
                    consular visits and got around a fair amount. Of course, there was the theater
                    and opera and music which was all very good. The apartment living was not bad I
                    would say. There were various apartments scattered around town most of which we
                    still have today. Superior I would say to the compound style of living that
                    existed in Belgrade and later to our regret we put into effect in the new
                    building that we have in Moscow.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>There was there of course, a good deal of obvious harassment. I think it was my
                    first year there that there was a Pravda correspondent in New York who'd had his
                    car stolen by a genuine auto thief. The car was found several days later in a
                    junkyard or some place with all of the seats taken out and the battery and
                    everything like that. I was going to an art exhibit in the Menage, which is
                    right in front of the National Hotel right across from the Kremlin, and I took
                    my big ugly Ford station wagon. At that time we were only allowed to have
                    American cars and so I had this station wagon which I absolutely hated. It was
                    sort of a bilious green and it was full of stuff from the commissary. I got out
                    of my car and a militiaman was standing right there. I went into the Menage, saw
                    the exhibit, came back and the car was gone. I said to the militiaman, “Where's
                    my car?” He says, “What car?” So, I figured out that this was no doubt
                    retaliation and indeed it was so precise retaliation that in the same number of
                    days after they, the police called the embassy and said, “We found your car
                    unfortunately it doesn't have any tires, it doesn't have any engine, it doesn't
                    have any of this stuff, but please send the embassy tow truck down to pick it
                    up.” I said, “Well, I don't really think I'll do that. I fortunately have my car
                    insured by the Soviet government insurance agency. Ingostrakh. You tell me the
                    car is a total wreck, I'll have the insurance company come and take a look at
                    it.” That infuriated them of course because the last thing that the KGB expected
                    to do was to have the Soviet insurance company pay me for the car. Apparently
                    some of this fury was picked up later in terms of what we heard from the
                    telephone conversations that were going on at the time. But the insurance
                    company paid, I took the money, I went to Finland and I got myself a new Volvo
                    station wagon for the same amount of money. Jake Beam, who was then the
                    ambassador, managed to assign me to go up to be present at the beginning of the
                    SALT Talks in Helsinki as a means of being able to let Peggy and me go up to
                    pick up the car. So, that turned out all right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any problems during this first time you were
                        there in '68 to '70 as far as provocations for you or your family or
                        anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>BARRY: I mean there were the kinds of things where we would say we were going out
                    and we would forget something and come back to the apartment and find that the
                    wires were all hanging out of the walls because they had started to improve the
                    listening devices and that kind of thing. Actually one of the, I guess we took a
                    nanny with us who was not a very bright woman, but she fell in with a Russian
                    who lived somewhere in that same complex and it turned out the Russian's uncle
                    was one of the people that monitored our tapes and she got taken into the room
                    or found the room where they had all these tapes running, but provocations in
                    the sense of the kind of thing one usually thinks of, entrapment, no. But it
                    happened to other people and we were actually probably excessively warned to
                    keep our heads down. We arrived there on the day before the Soviets invaded
                    Czechoslovakia. All social contacts were forbidden, deep freeze in relations so
                    that first year was conditioned very much by all that. Yes, I remember one of
                    the first things I don't know how we fell into this group, but there was a group
                    of Russians who were clearly very much disenchanted by all this. We were doing
                    something with them, which involved watching the hockey game between
                    Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union in which the Czechs unexpectedly beat the
                    pants off the Russians. This was a case of great celebration by the Russians who
                    were there who were feeling pretty bad about what had happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously you were focused on consular affairs. This was
                        earlBrezhnev, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Early Brezhnev.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting sort of from your colleagues who
                        werdealing more with the government than?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Because of the Czech thing we had not very much to do with the government
                    at that time. This was the time when we had hoped, when Johnson had hoped to
                    have the beginning of the SALT negotiations at the end of his term. This was the
                    time when Vietnam was escalating and there was lots of propaganda about Vietnam.
                    Actually we in the consular section were not all that busy and so we did have
                    time and inclination to do a fair amount of reporting as well. I took my
                    particular specialty, Soviet law, especially Soviet criminal law, and followed a
                    lot of the cultural things going on. I think George Humphrey did some of the
                    same things. We were both scheduled to go on to the political section for our
                    second year there. I remember that I sent a memo to Coby Swank, the DCM at that
                    time, a copy of which I still have someplace saying, here we are sitting down
                    here with not enough to do for three of us in the consular section. We'd really
                    like to supplement what the embassy is doing and other things and so please give
                    us assignments and things to do. I think really during that period we spent as
                    much time doing reporting as we did doing consular work.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>The consular cases, well there were some interesting protection cases. I remember
                    one automobile accident out and around Smolensk where Americans had been in a
                    crash. It was still possible to drive your car although it was kind of hard to
                    do in those days. So, we went out to visit these people who were in a regular
                    old hospital in the back woods. The regular old hospitals in Moscow weren't so
                    hot, but out there in the countryside they had nothing. They were sort of in
                    these gurneys along the wall of the corridor of the hospital. Because they had
                    been so smashed up in their faces the treatment that they had used to reduce the
                    suffusion of blood was leeches. The daughter was a registered nurse and was
                    initially kind of horrified by it, but as she saw how this all worked, she
                    thought well this isn't such a bad idea after all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Soviet law? Did you get a feel
                        for it beyond what happened with Americans, which would be almost atypical?
                        With others I mean was it a solid working system did you feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, it was very much slanted in favor of the State. By the time a case
                    had proceeded through a preliminary investigation a decision had been made as to
                    whether the person was guilty or not. The only question was what the degree of
                    severity of the sentence should be. In a way this is true of any Napoleonic code
                    country because the procurator or the investigator has the task of both
                    prosecution and defense as it were. We did go to a fair number of trials, just
                    to Russian trials where you can walk into courtrooms and sit down just to be
                    able to observe the nature of the proceedings. They had a judge and they had two
                    so-called peoples' assessors who were sort of the functional equivalent of a
                    jury-people who were not trained in the law, but sat in with the judge to help
                    make up their minds on things like this. The legal community was very much under
                    the gun under the communist party and we were in a case for example of some of
                    the people who we got to know because they were defending Americans were
                    occasionally people who were before people who had defended dissidents. They
                    were certainly not good for your legal practice to do that kind of thing and you
                    could get yourself removed from the Lawyers Collegium, which was the group of
                    lawyers who dealt with these thing, if you were too assiduous of your defense of
                    somebody.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The other thing we did a lot of in those days was to go to lectures, the
                    so-called knowledge society ran lectures on international affairs, on domestic
                    affairs and people who held the title of lecturers of the communist party would
                    go around and appear in so-called red corners of the housing units and in other
                    public venues to sort of give people the low down of what was going on in the
                    world or at home. Then the various deputies at election time would go out and
                    lecture and sort of present themselves to their constituents as then would-be
                    representative in the parliament. These were generally much more revealing than
                    the newspapers, they weren't supposed to be for foreigners. If they knew you
                    were a foreigner they wouldn't let you in, but we would sort of dress up looking
                    our most Russian and we would buy subscriptions to the lectures and we'd go to
                    the door and pay our two rubles and walk in and sit down. I think in many ways
                    that was the most productive reporting we had on domestic political issues and
                    some foreign policy issues. I mean I recall going to these appearances of
                    deputies and being convinced at the very depth of cynicism about the political
                    system because the people in general were complaining and dismissing whatever
                    promises they heard. I mean, there was this one woman who stood up in one of
                    these lectures and said that, “I've been coming to these lectures for 20 years
                    ever since the end of the war. You're the fifth deputy that's come up here.
                    Every time one of you comes I say in 1944 an artillery shell came through the
                    wall of my apartment and the next day somebody put up some boards to keep the
                    cold out, but nobody has ever come to repair it since.” She said, “I'll bet you
                    will say that you will see to it that somebody comes and repairs my apartment,
                    but I'll bet you that ten years from now that wall will still be unrepaired.”
                    Indeed, when I was back in Moscow a few weeks ago as an election observer I ran
                    into the same kind of complaints by people about their elected representatives.
                    People would ask questions about Vietnam and doesn't the war in Vietnam mean
                    that there's no way in which we and the Americans would get along. The lecturers
                    would essentially say, “No, no, I mean the Vietnamese have got their own
                    problems. It's very important for us to get along with the Americans” and that
                    kind of thing. At the same time you'd hear some of the most scandalous stories
                    about the kinds of subversion that the American Embassy was up to and things
                    like that, but these lectures were I think a very valuable insight into the
                    society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the political section from what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>BARRY: This was '69 to '70 and to my surprise I was double hatted. The person who
                    had been the Middle East person, was Norman Anderson, was somebody who genuinely
                    knew something about the Middle East, but for some reason or other they were
                    short on people that year, maybe somebody had been expelled, but I was partly
                    the multilateral section and partly the internal section. The multilateral
                    portfolio I had was the Middle East which was interesting because that was the
                    time in which we were carrying out first quadripartite and then bilateral
                    negotiations with the Soviets about the Middle East in the wake of the '67 war.
                    The idea was to develop a framework for peace talks and of course the Soviets
                    wanted to be co-chairman and wanted to establish their own droit de regard over
                    events in the Middle East. We were eager to keep them out, but on the other
                    hand, their relationships with the Egyptians and the Syrians and such was such
                    that we couldn't entirely exclude them. This was the time that Joe Sisco was
                    assistant secretary. Roy Atherton was the office director in charge of the
                    bilateral negotiations so they were coming back and forth and Joe and Roy would
                    come and we would have discussions with the Soviets in hopes of developing this
                    bilateral track into something that would allow more progress to take place in
                    the four power forum which is what we preferred, but which the Soviets didn't
                    really want to play ball and they didn't want to emphasize the bilateral part of
                    it. So, it was there that I got to know Primakov who was the Middle East
                    correspondent of Izuestuya who is now the foreign minister and a lot of people
                    in the foreign ministry in the Middle East division and in the Americas
                    division. While on the internal side I followed things like some of thedissident
                    trials and I guess developments in, the Sinyausky-Daniel case and all that kind
                    of thing. That was a quite interesting combination of things to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our ambassador was Malcolm Toon the whole time you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: No. Toon was office director in Washington and later deputy assistant
                    secretary. He didn't come to Moscow until the '80s. My first ambassador was
                    Tommy Thompson and the second year it was Jake Beam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell a little about how first Thompson and then
                        Beam ran, I mean your impression of how they both ran the embassy and how
                        they, what you were getting from them about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, Thompson was very distant. It was his second time there. He'd had a
                    marvelous first tour during the Khrushchev period where things were quite open
                    and he was able to go to receptions and talk to Khrushchev and talk to all the
                    key people. The second time the relationship was not doing well to say the
                    least. This was in the early Brezhnev years and so it didn't have the sort of
                    spontaneity it had before. I think he was not in the best of health at that time
                    and I think he really didn't feel he needed an embassy. He was the person who
                    knew everything there was to know about the place and so he was a rather distant
                    figure I say after being there for a year and then going to his staff meetings
                    every week. I know he didn't know who I was.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the same feeling in Belgrade with George Kennan. He
                        would go around and say, “What do we hear from the political section, Alex?
                        and from the consular section?” You know, I mean and all this I realized he
                        never really focused on who I was. Let me, wait a second, this just went
                        off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Jack Beam was a different sort of a person and his wife Peggy was a very
                    engaging person who wanted to involve everybody, very warm. I guess Beam was in
                    Prague at the time of the invasion, so had been there before of course but it
                    had been right after the war. He didn't have the long background in Soviet
                    affairs that Thompson did so he was sort of feeling his way and of course he's a
                    very laconic sort of personality, but somebody who was always interested in what
                    people had to say. So, I think he and the embassy felt more engaged than before.
                    The two DCMs who were there were first Coby Swank and then Boris Klosson. They
                    were both very good. Basically it was a very good embassy both of those years.
                    Stape Roy was there in the multilateral section with me at the time and Tom
                    Niles and many others who'd gone on to very distinguished careers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any difference (I mean obviously you were
                        not at the level where you would feel it unless it came sort of ajar,) but
                        the arrival of the Nixon administration in '69 on relations with the Soviet
                        Union and Henry Kissinger was the national security advisor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I had a lot to do with that later on, but I think the first
                    awareness that I had of it was a trip by Kissinger to Moscow which they had not
                    advised me that he was coming. I guess the only way that Jake found out about it
                    was when the foreign ministry called him and invited him to go say goodbye to
                    Henry as he left which I can say was not taken very well, not only by the
                    ambassador, but by the other officers. I think in that period these Middle East
                    negotiations were going on in the Nixon administration. There was the bilateral
                    thing that Joe Sisco was doing, so in that sense, in some ways things had thawed
                    out since the invasion of Czechoslovakia. At that stage the Russians all assumed
                    that Nixon was going to be a extreme anti-communist and were the propaganda was
                    very anti-Nixon and there were not great expectations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, why don't we end this at this point. We'll pick
                        thiup, what happened in '70 did you go back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I was designated to be the advance party for the consulate in Leningrad,
                    but without going back to the States, for one reason or another I ended up
                    coming back to the States and going to USUN for a year.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 4th of October, 2001. I think there's been about a five year gap,
                    hasn't there? But, really we're picking this up in 1970, the summer of 1970.
                    This would put you in time with the UN autumn session and all that.</p>
                <p>BARRY: I came back originally because my father was ill. Also they weren't ready
                    yet to open the offices in Leningrad. They hadn't been able to find adequate
                    space, so I went back to my sort of home base EUR/SOV and they said, “Oh, we
                    need somebody in New York.” This was a time of the Jewish Defense League and the
                    terrorists attacks against the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain a little for somebody who isn't too
                        familiawith what this was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: This was a radical Jewish group led by Rabbi Meir Kahane and their issue
                    was Jewish emigration, but their instrument of choice was attacks against Soviet
                    mission personnel. They were really quite radical. It went beyond harassment;
                    there had even been a couple of shots fired through school bus windows and
                    things like that. So, the school buses were attacked and it was particularly
                    virulent in New York and so they needed somebody to go up there and work with
                    the Soviet mission and also to act as a political advisor on the staff of USUN.
                    There were people who felt with the Russians who had served in Moscow and spoke
                    Russian so we went up there. Finally found a place we could afford to live
                    in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's always a major problem, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, we ended up in a place called Scarborough on the Hudson in a house
                    that had been owned by John L. Lewis's daughter, the mine worker union leader.
                    It was a beautiful view, but it was a terrible commute. Anyhow, this was during
                    the period when Charles Yost was the permanent representative at least at the
                    beginning phase of my time. I remember being in and meeting with Ambassador Yost
                    when somebody handed him a piece of paper from the news wire that announced that
                    Nixon had announced the appointment of George H. W. Bush as permanent
                    representative, something that profoundly disturbed Yost who had no advance
                    notice of it. The rest of us who wondered what a congressman from Texas could
                    possibly contribute to this. In the event George Bush was, I thought, a very
                    excellent permanent representative because he didn't know much about the whole
                    thing he tended to rely more on his staff than Yost did. My particular series of
                    events had a lot to do with him over time. There were other things going on in
                    the UN as well. We were dealing with the Russians about the Middle East. That
                    had just been my portfolio at the embassy in Moscow and so we continued
                    discussions about the idea of co-chairmanship or the quadripartite efforts to
                    promote aid to a settlement. This was of course still during the pre-detente
                    period, but was sort of the beginnings of the flowering of the detente to be
                    followed by the summit in 1972 in Moscow. This was still the period of feeling
                    one another out.</p>
                <p>Of course, there was a lot going on in the Security Council and of course, that
                    involved us a good deal. One of my jobs as it were being the junior person who
                    was supposed to go out and try to twist other delegates' arms to support U.S.
                    positions on one issue or another and by and large it was a very interesting
                    year. At the end of that year, Bush asked me if I didn't want to stay, but I had
                    by that time invested quite a lot in going to Leningrad. I did, by the way, stay
                    in touch with George H. W. Bush over the years. He is an inveterate note writer,
                    so whenever something came up he would sort of handwrite notes to people that
                    he'd known at that time. When he went to China when he was vice president, that
                    connection remained. In fact it was when I was nominated as ambassador to
                    Bulgaria in 1981 he called to give me the word that the White House had approved
                    this. I wasn't there. I was walking the dog or something, so Peggy got the call
                    from Vice President Bush and made the somewhat naive mistake of asking him if he
                    knew New Hampshire. He said he knew every drug store in the whole state. Anyhow,
                    we at that same time had bought a house of our own in New Hampshire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where in New Hampshire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: In a place called Rindge, which is down on the border with Massachusetts
                    near Mount Monadnock. We had just moved into this place. It was a small town of
                    about 1,200. I went to Leningrad in July and Peggy stayed in New Hampshire. We
                    made the arrangements so that she could come out from New Hampshire. She had to
                    pack an awful lot of food and things like that at that time going into the
                    USSR.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to back up and talk a little about the UN. I
                        would imagine that the Soviet delegation would be just absolutely mad as
                        hell about this Jewish Defense League stuff. Were you able to mollify or do
                        anything on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: They were mad as hell and I don't blame them for being mad as hell. The
                    New York police were less than 100% into doing something about this, so a lot of
                    what we did was pressure on the police and on the mayor to take this more
                    seriously. Of course, the argument we used is well we're very vulnerable to
                    reciprocity in these things. I knew about that firsthand because I had already
                    had my car destroyed the year before in Moscow as a matter of reciprocity.
                    Somebody had stolen a car belonging to a TASS correspondent in New York and the
                    car was eventually found stripped of everything. So, exactly the same thing
                    happened to my car by coincidence. It was stolen from in front of the Menage,
                    which is in the center, by the National Hotel in the center of Moscow. I found
                    it exactly the same number of days all torn up. So, the Soviets foreign ministry
                    called and said you've got to come and get your car. It's a mess, but these
                    things happened. I said no that I wasn't really interested because I happen to
                    have insurance with the Soviet State Insurance Company, in Ingostrakh, and they
                    would pay for it all. I hated the car anyhow and since at that time you had to
                    buy American cars, but I then managed to go up and buy a Volvo with the money
                    that Ingostrakh gave me. I think it annoyed the KGB considerably to find that
                    they had somebody else and that the Soviet government had to pay for their
                    reciprocity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Nixon administration, this was early
                        days, in about when you arrived about 18 months. How did they treat the UN,
                        because the UN has often been particularly on the Republican side sort of a
                        focal point of unhappiness or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, obviously, Bush was in with the Nixon administration and when he
                    became permanent representative I think that he was an advocate for making
                    better use of the UN. This was really before we had any of these deep
                    ideological UN feelings, before we had had the problems with payment of the dues
                    and so forth. In issues like Southern Africa where we were beginning to work on
                    independence in places like Namibia and Northern Rhodesia and places like that,
                    the UN was an important tool. When it came to the Middle East, although I guess
                    we were in many cases facing a defensive battle against the resolutions which
                    would have created problems with Israel it was nevertheless an important place.
                    We had annual consultations where the president came up and met with other heads
                    of state. We had the secretary of state to go up at the beginning of every
                    session of the general assembly for two or three weeks. We'd have a round of
                    bilateral discussions with all kinds of people. Whenever Gromyko came to the UN
                    he came down to Washington and met with the president and that kind of thing. I
                    think it certainly, the relationship with the UN when they got their own person
                    in there, you know Bush had a voice and he was a member of the cabinet.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in Jewish migration that issue of
                        from thSoviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Oh, yes. I mean this was a field that I was involved in when I was head of
                    the consular section in Moscow. It was a political issue that continued to be.
                    Then it was before the Jackson-Vanik legislation had headed the agenda, but it
                    was a very prominent public issue then. In Dobrynin's memoirs says he could
                    never understand why the leadership of the Politburo was so adamant on this
                    issue, that he would have thought it would have saved all kinds of problems one
                    way or the other for them to allow Jewish emigration. In '73 it went up to
                    something like 40,000 and then there was negotiation about a quota of 60,000 or
                    50,000 that went on in '74, but then detente crumbled and that was cut off again
                    entirely. In the early days it was considered to be treason if you wanted to
                    leave and that was a view held very strongly by the KGB and by the conservative
                    members of the Politburo and they carried it on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the fine hand of Henry Kissinger at that time, the

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: It didn't really come into the things that were going on at the UN. It
                    certainly did later on in '72 when I was in Leningrad and that was the time of
                    course when Kissinger came to town to prepare for the summit and didn't even
                    tell Ambassador Beam that he was there until he'd been there for four days and
                    then he just called in to announce that he'd been there. This really angered and
                    humiliated Ambassador Beam. At the time I was at the USUN and hadn't really
                    emerged as an issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Leningrad. What was the background of
                        openinup Leningrad?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>BARRY: We had had consulates in the USSR before the war. We had a consulate in
                    Leningrad, which had been in the location of our previous embassy in St.
                    Petersburg. We had, during the war, a consulate in Vladivostok. These were shut
                    down after the war and during the period of concern about internal security and
                    the McCarthy period and so forth. The USSR kept travel restrictions on Americans
                    in the Soviet Union and we had reciprocated by putting restrictions on their
                    travel in the U.S. Mac Toon in particular, who was the director of Soviet
                    affairs in the late '60s, believed that it was important for us to open more
                    windows on the USSR because he felt that we were more restricted in the
                    information that we could gather than they were in what they could get through
                    open sources in the U.S. He worked on the issue of a consular convention with
                    the USSR which could give us greater rights in terms of access to arrested
                    citizens and regulate citizenship cases and things like that. This had slow
                    going in the congress because they were very suspicious of anything like that.
                    They thought that it was going to lead to the opening of many Soviet consulates
                    in the U.S., which the FBI was against. We made the argument that the two things
                    were divisible, that we could have a consular convention without having
                    consulates. Then the consular convention did go through the congress. It was
                    ratified. We then used it to good effect in being able to insist upon access to
                    arrested Americans in three to five days and all those regulations that went
                    along with it. Then the discussion began of reciprocal consulates in San
                    Francisco and in Leningrad. By 1970 than had been agreed in principle, but of
                    course the great problem was premises. They didn't want to give us anything that
                    would be either too centrally located or would enable us to carry out
                    intelligence operations that they didn't want us to do and of course our people
                    had the same problem in San Francisco. They got themselves a quite desirable
                    space in a high location in San Francisco and they offered us quite
                    unsatisfactory office premises that had common walls with a building on both
                    sides, which was bad from a security point of view.</p>
                <p>The consul general at the time, Culver Gleysteen, was quite happy with the consul
                    general's residence, which was a small palace, which had been occupied at one
                    point by one of the Czar's mistresses. He was in favor of moving in, but the
                    question of office space had not been satisfactorily resolved. So when I went
                    there in the summer of '71, our office and our living space was in the Hotel
                    Astoria. It was at least a step up from where they wanted to put us, which was
                    the Hotel Baltiskaya, fit only for spies and dogs. We worked out of a suite in
                    the Astoria and lived there with our three children, dog, and a teacher we had
                    to bring along for our children. There were at that point two other families
                    there, and the consul general and his wife. That circumstance, well it was quite
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1971?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Until '73. Because this was a place where there had been no NATO diplomats
                    before, the local KGB had not yet quite caught up with the surveillance issue.
                    So, in that sense it was more open than Moscow, although at times I think that I
                    was used as the training vehicle for the KGB because I would always have three
                    or four cars following me at the same time.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>There were lots of things that went on there that you could gain access to you
                    which you wouldn't have had access to in Moscow. Public lectures or quasi-public
                    lectures or closed party meetings were some of the more interesting events. By
                    sort of looking as much like a grungy Russian as possible you could walk into
                    these meetings because they often put posters on the wall advertising that there
                    was going to be a discussion by a party instructor at a closed meeting. You
                    could go in there and listen to all this stuff and later report on it. Of course
                    we didn't have any classified communications facilities so the way we'd do that
                    is we would write it out in longhand, take it down to the train from Helsinki to
                    Moscow because there would be an American on that train as a courier. You'd run
                    down to the train station about midnight and stick your envelope through the
                    window to the courier who would carry it down to the embassy.</p>
                <p>We sometimes got very interesting information that ended up on the president's
                    desk. One of them this was at the time that I think Kosygin was in Vietnam we
                    were bombing Haiphong. We did this when Kosygin was there, and we did not know
                    if this meant that the Nixon summit would be called off. I was in this closed
                    party meeting at the time when somebody raised this question and the answer from
                    the party instructor was, “No, we discussed that in the party and we have
                    decided that this meeting must go ahead, that it is possible to have reductions
                    of tensions despite U.S. actions in Vietnam.” That was the first time we'd heard
                    anything about that through all of our various sophisticated intelligence
                    gathering. That bit of information sort of floated to the top. In Moscow I would
                    run around from one of these things to another and listening to what they said
                    about both economic and political issues and international relations in general
                    and in Leningrad I did the same.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I've heard from others, too, saying that during
                        these discussions, the public would come in and ask quite frank questions
                        and they'd get quite frank answers, completely different from the
                        gobbledygook that came out of Pravda or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Exactly. That was I think probably our most valuablpolitical reporting
                    source.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>BARRY: Much more than we did in Moscow. Eventually I think after about six months
                    of living in the Hotel Astoria we got into our apartment. We got a quite nice
                    apartment. It actually was a six-room apartment that had seven families in it
                    before we moved in. It had been built of course as a one family apartment and
                    then we went through it once and a local diplomatic service corps was showing us
                    this possibility. In each of the six rooms there were families, and one room was
                    divided in half, so there were two families in there. The people who lived there
                    were not unhappy to be moved out because it meant that they went back to the top
                    of the list for a separate apartment as opposed to a communal apartment. So, we
                    moved in there and we were the only foreign family in the building. In Moscow of
                    course we lived in a completely segregated facility with guards outside who kept
                    the Russians out. We had some fairly substantial personal contacts with the
                    neighbors in the building including a navy lieutenant commander who invited us
                    to dinner at his house. The people upstairs from us were I think there because
                    of the listening devices that were directed as us, but their kids came and
                    played with ours. So, we had Soviet children in the apartment playing and our
                    children went out and played hockey with them. We knew the sort of dissident
                    crowd; artists and one person that we knew quite well. He used to come by; he
                    began to ask us about Nixon's plans for when he came to Leningrad. I could tell
                    this wasn't a smart thing to talk about in front of the microphones. He didn't
                    reappear in our lives again until three or four years later when he turned up on
                    our doorstep in Washington. What had happened to him was that he had been
                    arrested and taken to an insane asylum and had been committed. His mother was a
                    doctor of some kind, so she got him out, but only to get an exit visa and he was
                    required to go immediately to Israel. He didn't like Israel much either so he
                    got out of there. I think he ended up at the Thunderbird School of Business in
                    Arizona. Then he came back to Washington. Anyhow, that was the kind of
                    experience that we also knew quite well. We knew the painter Rukhin and his
                    family, he eventually died in a fire in his studio, which some people accused
                    the KGB of setting.</p>
                <p>Well, we spent a lot of time preparing for the Nixon summit because one of the
                    features of that was a side trip to Leningrad where there was a very detailed
                    program of things for him to do. Our job was to ensure that the palace at
                    Pavlovsk, which was one of the gems of the Czarist era, was properly prepared
                    for the Nixon visit. That included replacing the Turkish bomb sights with real
                    toilets in case the president or his wife needed to use them. Everything went
                    smoothly, but within six hours after the Nixons left the toilets were removed
                    again and reassembled at some party chieftain's place. The head of the local
                    party organization at that time was Romanov as in the Czars and one of his
                    notable adventures was that when his daughter got married he got all of the
                    Romanov porcelain table settings out of the Hermitage and set the table for the
                    wedding. I remember things were broken presumably as a result of throwing them
                    around during the party. But Romanov was quite a hardliner and he was a full
                    member of the politburo at that time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: There was a longstanding rivalry between Leningrad and Moscow and the
                    other thing that Romanov got himself into was the support for the idea of making
                    Leningrad the capital of the Russian Federation. They would keep Moscow as the
                    capital of the USSR, but all of this, I mean that was how Kirov got himself in
                    trouble back in 1934. So, I think Romanov overstepped himself. There was a lot
                    of sentiment for Leningrad as being a more European city.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice a difference between the thrust of what you
                        calpolitical and cultural life between Leningrad and Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, certainly the theater in Leningrad was very active. As today there
                    are dozens of beautiful theaters. The Kirov Ballet and the opera was eclipsed by
                    the Bolshoi, but of course it had a proud tradition of its own. All the people
                    of Leningrad thought they were more cultured than the people were in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unlike those “nekultarni” in Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Right. We did run into a lot of the former aristocracy one way or the
                    other, walking the dog. Peggy ran into an elderly woman who was left over from
                    the old days and still had the part of her old apartment, but then people were,
                    once you announced who you were and why you were there, then obviously they knew
                    that you were a dangerous person to be around. We had a dacha on the Baltic Sea
                    north of Leningrad which was a very nice place to spend weekends and go skiing
                    on the ice in the Baltic and drive to Finland and so forth. The diplomatic
                    community was much smaller than in Moscow. Our closest friends were the Finns.
                    Of course, their main task aside from maintaining friendly relationships with
                    the bear at their doorstep, was to pick up the odd Finn who had forgotten to get
                    back on the boat after coming over on the weekend to get cheap Vodka. The Finns
                    knew the country quite well. We were standing on the review stand for the parade
                    for the great October socialist revolution and a Cuban colleague gave us all
                    Cuban cigars and our Finnish colleague gave us all Finnish Vodka to keep us
                    warm. There were no other NATO countries that were represented at the time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about American tourism or West European tourism, I

                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>BARRY: There wasn't very much going on then. I mean we had occasional American
                    cultural groups coming through, but it was I think still pretty much off the
                    beaten track.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Nixon visit, how did that go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: It went smoothly, but there were certainly some rough parts leading up to
                    it. I remember Peggy Beam being absolutely enraged by this marine major who was
                    part of the advance. He was running around the house checking it over for the
                    Nixons and Mrs. Beam was talking about how we were going to do the dinner here
                    and his response to her was lady get out of here. We're doing this and we don't
                    want you to be hanging over our shoulder all the time. So, I don't think from
                    that point of view it went well. All advance parties can be very difficult to
                    deal with. This was probably the most difficult one I can remember.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with the embassy I mean were

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, we went down once a week or every couple of weeks.People from the
                    embassy came up to visit us, particularly the attaches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling that having Leningrad, I mean you were
                        there obviously in the early days, was it a good thing, was everybody pretty
                        pleased?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: There was certainly no feeling that what we were reporting was in any
                    sense undermining the embassy reporting or anything of that sort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Baltic States? Could you talk about the
                        speciatreatment relationship we had with them and your role in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: That was part of our consular district. While the ambassador and senior
                    people in the embassy were not allowed to be in the Baltic States because of our
                    non-recognition policy, because we had the consular mandate could and did travel
                    extensively in Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia. It did give us an insight into
                    the depth of feeling there about Russian domination, the depth of the feelings
                    against the Russians. Also, of course it was on a much higher economic level
                    than most of provincial Russia. So, going to Tallinn, for example was a treat in
                    more ways than one. They of course, did have a lot of contact across the Finnish
                    gulf, across the Baltic Sea with Finns, Scandinavians. The KGB was pretty active
                    there, they looked for any signs of nationalism getting out of control.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you when you were looking at Leningrad at sort of the
                        closer you get to the West, the more things sort of seem to be a little
                        closer to less more barbaric or civilized, it's long term, but did you get a
                        feel for sort of how the Russian economy and the Russian, I mean the Soviet
                        system was working there that was any different than what was seen in the
                        Moscow optic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: They did have a lot of heavy industry in Leningrad. I guess I would say
                    that it was probably some of the best heavy industry they had. Defense industry
                    and as we later found out when we entered some of these factories that had been
                    off limits before, they were really state of the art. They tried to explain why
                    they were so far advanced in one segment of the economy and so backward in
                    others. The kinds of metal presses they had to use for example to make
                    containment vessels for nuclear submarines were fantastic things. Later when I
                    went to visit one of these factories after 1991 they had turned it into a
                    consumer goods production claiming they were making beer-brewing machines using
                    the same presses. I don't think it was ever economical. Also, by the way when we
                    were there one of our interests was Murmansk, which was so important during
                    World War II. A couple of times we went up to visit there because many of those
                    people who died in World War II convoys are still buried in the graveyards of
                    Murmansk; these were monuments to the sacrifices made by the Americans to keep
                    Russia in the war something that was not a very popular theme at that time. Some
                    of the more crude anti-American propaganda again goes back to the '60s was the
                    story of the Colorado Beetle. I don't know if you remember that story, but the
                    American potato beetle began to move across Europe in the 1930s. It got to
                    Czechoslovakia about 1948 or '49 and moved from there across gradually to infest
                    larger and larger areas of the Warsaw Pact. There was a famous poster that was
                    up all over the place that showed millions of these little beetles with CIA
                    written on their sides being dropped out of airplanes by parachutes. The story
                    was that this was an effort to sabotage the economy of the former Soviet Union
                    or of the Warsaw Pact. There's a famous incident that Ellis Briggs talks about
                    in his book, Farewell to Foggy Bottom. Anyhow Ellis Briggs talks about receiving
                    a diplomatic note from the foreign ministry talking about the depredations of
                    the potato beetle and citing its Latin name and insisting that the U.S. stop
                    this aggression against the Czech people. He wrote a marvelous note in response.
                    The conclusion was that the potato beetle and he gave its Latin name should
                    never be able to gnaw away at the ties of friendship that join the Czech and
                    American peoples.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, were you having any problems with people
                        seekinasylum, that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, from time to time we would get feelers from some people who either
                    wanted to be recruited or who wanted to entrap us into a recruitment situation
                    and you never could be sure how to respond to those things. I turned them over
                    to the person on the staff who was responsible for that kind of thing. One day
                    on a park bench I sat down next to an old man who really looked as if he had
                    lived through hell. He said that he had been in the Polish army in 1939 and
                    after the collapse of Poland he had been taken with many others to labor camps
                    in the USSR and in this case he had been in a uranium mine in Central Asia. Of
                    course the conditions there were appalling. He said that at one point after
                    Stalin died, he was still restricted to living in that area although the labor
                    camp was closed down. But he had managed to conceal himself on the roof of a
                    freight train that made its way across the steppes and had ended up in
                    Belorussia and had sought out Polish consul and the Polish consul had said, “Oh,
                    yes we'll be glad to help you, but you just have to go across the street here to
                    get your papers regularized.” Of course, across the street was the KGB and they
                    immediately sent him back to Central Asia. I guess he had suffered terribly from
                    this train ride because he'd frozen large parts of his body. He went back to the
                    camp and by this time it was 1973 and he had been allowed to leave the area and
                    come back to Leningrad or Moscow, but not ever back to Poland. That was the kind
                    of tale you'd heard from people in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem with harassment or enticement or
                        that sorof thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I was certainly regarded as and publicly identified as being with the CIA,
                    so yes, close surveillance, but I didn't suffer any active harassment, nor did
                    my family. I think as long as you didn't try to trick these people by trying to
                    get out from under the surveillance it would be okay. Now there one of my
                    colleagues did suffer some active harassment and dangerous situations including
                    some kind of confrontation on a bridge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The initial staff of our consulate general, how many

                <p>BARRY: Culver Gleysteen. Q: He's part of the three brothers, Dirk and Bill. Bill
                    Gleysteen was my ambassador in Korea at one point, but the three brothers sort
                    of went separate ways in the Foreign Service. How did he operate?</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>BARRY: He and I did not get along particularly well. His wife, Flicka, was an
                    extremely difficult person I would say. He was very interested in the care and
                    maintenance of his palace. He was not much into the reporting side of things and
                    I think while I was stirring up the pot by doing all this stuff he wrote me an
                    efficiency report which downgraded my reporting while at the same time the DCM
                    put me in for the reporting award. So, it was kind of an uncomfortable
                    relationship. He was I would say the least successful of the Gleysteen brothers.
                    I think it bothered him. He was the son of missionaries in China and he used to
                    talk about the hardships of his life in Beijing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was again I mean, you know, we keep looking at the
                        Soviet Union and the whole Soviet economy was to collapse in less than 20
                        years from the time you were there. I mean both the political and the
                        economic system really went down. Was that at all, from your observation or
                        others, was this at all a thought in our minds that this is a limited system
                        or how did we feel? I'm trying to capture the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I don't think any of us thought that, least of all Dick Nixon. It's
                    interesting what Putin said in his speech to the Bundestag the other day, that
                    we listened a lot more to the Soviet Union when they were adversaries than we do
                    today to Russia when it wants to be a partner. We were still living under the
                    impression that Khrushchev tried to create with Sputnik and we were going to be
                    overtaken by Russia. Zbig Brzezinski perpetuated the idea of the arc of crisis,
                    an aggressive growing system that presents a threat to us that will only become
                    more serious over the years. Of course that was also fostered by those
                    intelligence analysts who thought that there was an advantage in making the
                    adversaries seem more capable than it really was because it would be helpful in
                    terms of getting more money for our own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is sort of a thesis that Kissinger and his twin

                        a defensive game at that time that the Soviet system looked so powerful it
                        was hard for democracies to stand up to them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, certainly if you, found Dobrynin's memoirs particularly interesting
                    in that regard because I think Dobrynin recognized more of the weaknesses of his
                    own system than Kissinger did and of course this whole idea of carrying this all
                    out in great secrecy made it even more difficult to manage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the news of the Kissinger secret visits and all, did
                        this permeate sort of a real unhappiness or dislike or something of
                        Kissinger that would sort of permeate our American diplomat group?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>BARRY: Oh, sure. Of course, Dobrynin had full access to Kissinger and the
                    discussion that went on between them were not made available either to the
                    embassy in Moscow or to the Secretary of State or anything of that kind.
                    Ambassador Beam wanted to establish equal access himself in which he was not
                    particularly successful and of course Gromyko much preferred to have this
                    handled in Washington because Dobrynin was able to free wheel in ways that
                    Gromyko himself was not. The system in Moscow was very rigid and in every
                    discussion about the Americans and American policy had to be approved by the
                    Politburo. But Dobrynin was free to talk on a what if basis, so I think during
                    that period there were one or two discussions between Beam and Gromyko, but
                    because Beam was not aware of any of the things that were discussed in the
                    Dobrynin channel it didn't work very well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: There was a rather vociferous propaganda about the incursion into
                    Cambodia, the bombings of Hanoi and Haiphong and all that. It certainly didn't
                    lead to any personal hostility. I do remember when Jane Fonda ended up in Moscow
                    and came down to demonstrate against American policy in front of the American
                    embassy and was whisked away by the KGB because this had not been a planned
                    demonstration. She was heard to exclaim when she was bundled into the car,
                    “Heavy man, heavy.”</p>

                <p>BARRY: Back to Washington. I looked around for something to do to remain involved
                    in Soviet affairs, but there wasn't anything open at the moment. My old friend
                    and colleague Kempton Jenkins got in touch with me and said how would I like to
                    run the USSR division of the Voice of America. It sounded interesting to me
                    because instead of getting to manage one-third of a secretary, there were 140
                    people there, and three or four divisions. The Russia division, Ukranian, Uzbek,
                    a couple of others, Georgian, Azeri. So, I took that and came back and found it
                    quite interesting. It was at the time of the beginning of the unraveling of
                    detente. It was the time of the growth of dissent and the impact of Sakharhov,
                    Solzhenitsyn and all that. The people working there, most of them of course were
                    emigrants. Different waves of immigrants, some were from before the war, some of
                    them were, one of the leading people there was a Chechan who had been a member
                    of the institute of red professors and he had defected and I guess probably made
                    his way to VOA. Anyhow, there were some who were Jewish and there were some that
                    were anti-Semitic and they spent a lot of time fighting with each other. The
                    Ukrainians would fight with the Russians and all that sort of thing so it
                    required a firm hand often. Also there was the usual stress and strain of the
                    State Department telling us what to report, what not to report. We've seen it
                    again recently about reporting the comments of Osama Bin Laden and of course the
                    idea of many of the people there is that we are journalists just like any other
                    and we report all the news whenever we see it. Kissinger was particularly upset
                    about the amount of attention paid to Solzhenitsyn and Sakharhov and we would
                    regularly hear from our colleagues at the State Department or from the USIA
                    regional office that we had to tone this down. At some point I did because it
                    was getting to the point where every other sentence was about this and nothing
                    else was being reported. Then of course the people who I told not to do it so
                    often went to the press and complained there. But it was an interesting
                    experience. There were some wonderful young people there who had learned Russian
                    as exhibit guides. Jill Dougherty from CNN was one of them and she was able to
                    broadcast in fluent Russian and on the air all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, you were there from '73 until?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Until mid-'74 I guess. In mid-'74 the job of deputy director at EUR/SOV
                    came up much to my surprise because I was then a fairly junior FSO-3. I was
                    asked to take this job. There were three, four deputies I guess, but this was
                    the senior deputy and so the other people were senior to me. I guess I took it
                    over from Stape Roy who went on to the China desk. I moved over then and
                    shortened my tour with VOA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the VOA at that time when you would get complaints
                        from the State Department or elsewhere, you know, that you're overdoing
                        this, let's not exacerbate our relations too much. How were these
                        treated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>BARRY: I basically used my own judgment. I mean, I realized that we had to report
                    all these things with credibility. I did also realize that there was a point
                    beyond which we were doing what Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe were
                    supposed to do.</p>
                <p>The other thing that was going on at that time was Watergate. I heard lots of
                    complaints including from the Russians about why you're reporting all this stuff
                    about Watergate. As Dobrynin's memoirs indicate the Russians never could believe
                    that somebody as skillful as Nixon would have gotten himself into this kind of
                    situation and that it couldn't be fixed overnight. A lot of our people in the
                    staff didn't like reporting this stuff either, they thought it was not in our
                    national interest to be airing our dirty linen, but that had to be reported for
                    credibility. There were two lines of news reporting, one was the English
                    reporting which was translated into Russian and carried and that I didn't have
                    anything to do with because it was just a matter of automatically translating
                    it. But then there was an awful lot of stuff that was original, it was either
                    features or filler or news items from within the USSR that would be of
                    particular interest. At one point I was warned about what we were saying in
                    Uzbek. Now nobody in the management staff spoke any Uzbek. The guy who was the
                    head of the Uzbek service was probably somebody who had been involved in the
                    para military actions against the Soviet Union during or after the war. I did
                    finally hire somebody who did know Uzbek an academic from the outside who could
                    come and tell me what was going on and it turned out that what was going on was
                    pan-turanian propaganda. We had to get rid of him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you getting your material?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: We had correspondents in the USSR. We had stringers. We had both English
                    speaking correspondents and Russian speaking correspondents. A lot of people in
                    the periphery who would pick things up that were in the Russian language
                    journals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you considered, or were you looking over your
                        shoulder athe BBC Russian service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Oh, yes. Well, we were complementary in many ways. We exchanged visits,
                    the head of the division in the BBC and I listened to them to see if they had
                    things we didn't and so forth. It was difficult to adjust to because when you
                    went to work you stayed until everybody has gone home. Of course, VOA was on 18
                    hours a day so I had to get used to the idea that you don't stay in the office
                    all the time you're on the air. This led to a more relaxed existence than might
                    have otherwise been the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting much feedback from the Soviet Union on
                        what yowere doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>BARRY: You'd get regular complaints from the Soviet press about what was going
                    on. One of the big issues was did we read some dissident documents. RFE and RL
                    did that. I drew the line at reading large, long texts out loud on the air and
                    wanted them simply to make excerpts. We'd certainly hear from groups in this
                    country when they didn't like something that was going on. Usually, because some
                    of the individuals within the Service would go and complain to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have been carrying on a sort of a little war with
                        all these various groups all of whom who had probably fought each other or
                        something at one time or another?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, but I mean in general I would say that a lot of them, most of them
                    were people who were generally interested in even handed journalism. They
                    realized that this was lacking there and we should not imitate them, so I had
                    particular respect for the person who was the head of the Russian service Victor
                    Frantsuzov who was a very respected person within among the listeners. He was a
                    sort of Walter Cronkite of the Russian service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '74 you went to back to SOV and you were there until
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I'm trying to remember, let's see, when did Carter come in?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Carter came in in '77, January of '77.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Okay, when Carter came in I went over from SOV to be thdirector of UN
                    political affairs. I was in EUR/SOV from '74 to '77.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was sort of the structure of SOV and where did you
                        fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: The director was Mark Garrison, deputy director was me. There was a
                    director of bilateral affairs or the head of the office of bilateral affairs I
                    think was Jack Scanlan. There was the director of the multilateral affairs
                    office who I think was Sherrod McCall. There was the director of economic
                    affairs. There was a director of exchanges. That was Sol Polanski, so there were
                    four heads of offices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been difficult because this was again during
                        thKissinger era, I mean he was very much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: The era was extremely frustrating.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because the things that you knew nothing about was
                        stirrinaround all the time, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: And yet we were being asked to write papers for senior people to go do
                    things and we knew that for everyone of these things there were two briefing
                    books. There was a real briefing book that had been put together by people who
                    were in the know and there was the briefing book that we struggled to put
                    together and had to sort of guess at what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any effort made to say, “Come on fellows
                        let'straighten this out?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: This was a job that had to be done above our pay grade. This was Bill
                    Rogers' problem and Art Hartman was Assistant Secretary. They left some things
                    to us, bilateral issues, and we tried to get involved in the arms control
                    business and we wrote papers on that, but I doubt that any of them had much
                    resonance. Hal Sonnenfeldt when Kissinger came over to be Secretary of State,
                    Sonnenfeldt and his crowd sort of ran Soviet affairs directorate of their
                    own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was counselor of the department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Let's see, he was at INR at first. Then I guess he went over to be a staff
                    member at Kissinger's NSC and then he came back as counselor and he had a bunch
                    of aides working for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Should I mention that? I'm just coming to that part. I'm
                        interviewing Hal now and I'll be doing it next week or something. I mean was
                        it a heavy-handed operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Oh, yes. Of the one bridge between us all I guess Bill Suhinn had been in
                    SOV I guess and then he went over to work on Hal's staff. He was somebody who
                    would share things with us. The rest of them would not. I think if Sonnenfeldt
                    or Kissinger ever found out that he was sharing anything with us it would have
                    been too bad for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During '74 to '76 how did you see, you say detente was
                        becominfalling apart?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>BARRY: It was falling apart in part because of Soviet activities in the third
                    world and I guess this was the time of Angola and of Cuba getting involved. It
                    was falling apart because of domestic criticism of and it was falling apart in
                    part because Brezhnev himself was in decline and was unable to delink the
                    solution of the SALT agreement with another summit. They had summits in '72, '73
                    and I guess '74 was the last summit and by that time U.S. critics were already
                    accusing Nixon of using the Soviet card to hold onto power. They had a number of
                    agreements on the prevention of nuclear war and all this stuff, which were under
                    attack by the right wing, including right wing democrats. This was the period of
                    Jackson-Vanik and the insistence on agreement to a quota of immigration before
                    SALT I could be ratified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we seeing Brezhnev as somebody whose sort of hold on
                        power was getting weaker maybe because of age?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: No, I don't think we did at all. In fact it was at that point that we saw
                    Nixon's hold on power reducing. I think we underestimated the degree to which
                    Brezhnev's hardening of the arteries had affected him. Of course if you read
                    Dobrynin he never had much of a free hand in many of these things because of the
                    need for consensus among the Politburo, on all the various initiatives that
                    would be taken. The area where Brezhnev was most confident because of his
                    position before of being in charge of the military industrial complex was
                    essentially SALT, but he had opposition from both Grechko and Ustinov about a
                    lot of these issues. Marshall Grechko, the Defense Minister, and Ustinov, the
                    member of the Politburo responsible for military production.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing any affects with the so-called China cards
                        athat time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: This was the time of the Usuri River clashes between Russian and Chinese
                    troops. There was widespread rumor at the time that Brezhnev had sought U.S.
                    acquiescence in a Soviet nuclear attack on China, something I don't think was
                    ever put that boldly but I suspect there were fairly strong hints of it. Of
                    course, Kissinger definitely had a strategy in mind of linkage. China played a
                    large part in this linkage. There was more stress and strain about the third
                    world I think about Cuban activity, it got worse as the situation deteriorated
                    until finally in 1979 with Afghanistan that it went all away. It was a steadily
                    building cycle of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we looking at, you know the Soviets were making a
                        significant investment in Africa, were you sort of talking to our people in
                        the African bureau and trying to figure out what the hell, what does this
                        really mean, or was it just in general, I mean, they're spreading their
                        influence and this is a bad thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I think what we figured it meant was that they had an ideological
                    commitment to this and they believed in that part of the idea of peaceful
                    coexistence which sort of amounts to what's mine is mine and what's yours is
                    negotiable. In Dobrynin's explanation of it, the issues having to do with the
                    third world were not in the hands of the foreign ministry at all, they were in
                    the hands of the international department of the CPSU headed by Boris Ponomarev
                    who really believed in the ideological commitment. Dobrynin wonders out loud,
                    what kind of a dog did we have in this fight? Why were we interested in it? He
                    says, look at the situation now, did we make any lasting gains in the area? Of
                    course, then there was the whole Egypt-Israel issue, the six day war, the

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: That's right. Well, that put a major strain on the whole relationship, too
                    because at that point they had alerted some paratroop units and they began to
                    resupply things. We both did in fact at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling, you know I sometimes try to get
                        the attitude, that Kissinger because of his great diplomatic triumph if you
                        want to call it that was the opening to China, was a little too much on the
                        Chinese side than on the Soviet side or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I thought so at the time and I still do. Although he was frequently
                    denying that he was doing any of this because of a desire to get at the Soviets
                    I concluded that was very much what he was doing. He made little effort to
                    disguise it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe this is a good place to cut off because you in early

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: It was about 14 months I guess because then I was working for Bill Maynes
                    who had been a colleague of mine in Moscow and at some point along there he had
                    a vacancy as deputy assistant secretary in IO and I moved up into that job. I
                    guess that was about 14 months after that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, this was sort of the main political bureau. This was sort of the
                    powerhouse of IO. This was the job that Dean Rusk had had in his time and so
                    forth and we dealt with all political issues.</p>

                <p>Today is the 28th of November, 2001. Bob, 1977 you were in IO as yodescribed it.
                    What were the periods you were with IO?</p>
                <p>BARRY: I was Director of the UN Political Affairs in '77 and '78 and then I
                    became the Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Economic Affairs in IO,
                    so altogether it was about two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So '77 to '79 or '78?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, '79. Basically this of course was the beginning of the Carter
                    administration. My old Moscow colleague, Bill Maynes, was the Assistant
                    Secretary and we were good friends; Andy Young was the Permanent Representative
                    in New York. This was the period when we were very much involved in the Rhodesia
                    Zimbabwe issue, Southwest Africa, trying to promote the decolonization of what
                    was left of the colonial regimes in Africa, working on South Africa of course
                    and the usual Middle East question. UN political affairs was divided into two
                    segments. One of them basically dealt with African issues and the other segment
                    of it dealt with Middle East and there was a third group that worked on UN arms
                    control issues. So, there was a lot of things involved in preparations for the
                    annual general assembly. In fact one thing I remember distinctly was making my
                    first ever trip to Latin America to talk to the countries there about upcoming
                    issues in the general assembly. I got a picture for how narrow some of these
                    peoples' interest were. I was in Panama and I was talking to the deputy minister
                    in charge of UN affairs about the situation in I guess it was Botswana and
                    wouldn't Panama be interested in sending some people in a peacekeeping force and
                    they said yes, very interesting. It was later at dinner that the guy said to me
                    that he didn't know things were that bad in Bolivia. He'd just gotten the
                    continent wrong. This was a very active period. Of course, the Carter
                    administration placed a lot of value on Andy Young in the UN. He was and I guess
                    Jim Leonard was one of the deputy representatives in New York who was dealing
                    with lots of arms control issues at the time. I guess at some point along there
                    the person who was in charge of international economic affairs got an embassy or
                    something anyhow there was a vacancy there. Although I didn't really describe
                    myself as an economist, Bill Maynes asked me to take that job and of course,
                    basically all UN issues are political not economic no matter whether they're
                    called economic or not. This was over sight of things like the UNDP, the
                    International Atomic Energy Agency. The agencies like UNICEF and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to stop here and go back to this time when you
                        were dealing with the political affairs. In the first place to get an idea
                        it varies with administrations and personalities. How did IO work with our
                        delegation at the United Nations headed by Andy Young? In other words, how
                        would you describe the working relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I think there were personal relationships were very good because Bill
                    Maynes was close to Andy Young and so forth, but Andy was not what you would
                    call a person who went by the book of his instructions. He kind of freewheeled
                    on a lot of things, which caused some discomfort in the administration
                    particularly on Middle Eastern issues, because he was not particularly a friend
                    of Israel on many of these issues. So, there were some concern of course, there
                    were always articles in the press about where is the administration going. The
                    republican right was critical of many of these things. As far as Jimmy Carter
                    was concerned Andy Young could do no wrong. Other people in other offices in the
                    State Department were sometimes upset by him, some of the areas where the UN
                    delegation developed its own policy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get people from NEA coming to you and saying you
                        know,this is out of line and all this, or do something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I don't think they came to me because they realized that nobody was really
                    capable of instructing Andy to do some of these things, but certainly there was
                    a lot of frustration about it. I don't think in the final analysis that any harm
                    was done. It was more of sort of the loose canon syndrome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the negotiations that were going on, did you say it
                        waRhodesia. Rhodesia was settled by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: It was I think the early days of Mugabe's administration, but as I recall
                    at the beginning of this period it was still going through the process of they
                    were moving away from UDI to the departure of the white Rhodesian regime and of
                    course we were supporting that effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved much on the African
                        negotiations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Only in the sense of writing instructions for the Security Council or the
                    general assembly kinds of things. The face to face negotiations were done by
                    Andy and by a couple of his deputies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Don McHenry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Don McHenry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the first time that you had really dealt with the
                        UniteNations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, no I had been in the delegation to the UN when George Bush came in
                    as permanent representative I was there for a year. I'd been up to the UN for a
                    number of occasions at the time of the general assembly. They used to send
                    people up to be note takers, that was the general debate period. So, I'd been up
                    to the UN a couple of times. U.S. sympathy for the UN I think declined steadily
                    from say 1946 to the present almost, but it did not reach the kind of standoff
                    that happened in the '90s. So, the UN still was an instrument of choice on a lot
                    of issues and it enjoyed pretty good public support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the IO bureau? How did you feel under Bill
                        Maynes anall his, did you have much clout do you think in the
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I think it had clout in the foreign policy community because of
                    course Andy was a cabinet member and they did participate in all the cabinet
                    meetings. You've got some very good people in the bureau at that time, Tom
                    Niles, was one of the deputies in the UN political area. Of course, Gerry Helman
                    was the deputy assistant secretary for political issues. So, it was a good
                    bureau I think. It had considerable respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then on the economic side, what were your major
                        focuses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: The major focus was trying to shape the way in which the UN economic
                    agencies carried out their mandate. Of course UNDP had a major role in
                    developing economies around the world. UNDP's representatives were in most
                    developing countries and this was a major focus of U.S. development assistance
                    policy. IAEA was an important thing at that time if you were working on
                    proliferation things. There were a bunch of smaller agencies. UNIDO, the private
                    sector work that UN agencies carried out. So, it was a major task at that time
                    to ensure that the head of UNDP continued to be an American. In the event we
                    carried out a successful campaign to hold that job for an American. I was only
                    in that job for about six or eight months I guess, when I was asked by George
                    Vest to come over to the European bureau to be the deputy assistant secretary
                    for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. This created something of a conflict in
                    my mind because of course I was really close to Bill Maynes and he'd given me
                    this important job and to leave it and go somewhere else was not an easy thing
                    to do so I finally said, “Well, I'll leave it up to the system. They can decide
                    where I can go.” So, then I guess it was early in '79, probably January that I
                    went to the European bureaus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your position when looking at the development program
                        and all, how was the UN development program? I mean, how did they mesh? Did
                        they conflict? Were there any problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: The idea was that the UNDP was supposed to be the coordinator of
                    development assistance in every country so in addition to whatever programs the
                    UNDP put in place, they were supposed to coordinate bilateral donor assistance
                    programs. The USAID director in that country was supposed to work with UNDP and
                    that worked or didn't work depending on personalities as usual. UNDP had a lot
                    of technical assistance programs, a lot of training programs, but they didn't
                    have the big bucks infrastructure projects that for example we did. It was a I
                    think it was a good agency, but like other UN things it all depends on the
                    quality of the people you have because of the requirement for universality. As
                    often as not, the head of the UNDP in a country was somebody they wanted to get
                    out of the country and send somewhere else.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, then you moved over to the Soviet desk? So, your job
                        was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Soviet Union and EasterEurope.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you did this from early '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: To '81.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the state of relations in '79 to '81, well the
                        first things really went through a change, but when you arrived there in
                        '79, the Carter administration had put a lot of emphasis on trying to change
                        things around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, of course, the previous period had been the decline and fall of
                    detente. The Carter administration came in with a high emphasis on human rights
                    and they desired to make a change in the way, which we carried out our strategic
                    arms program so that we could get things through the congress. So, this was a
                    period of considerable distrust on the part of the Soviet leadership. Brezhnev
                    was still alive, but he was weakened at that point. He had had a number of small
                    strokes and was certainly not able to think on his feet. The period started out
                    with insistence on the immigration issue, Sakharhov, Solzhenitsyn and so forth.
                    I think one of the early steps was Carter's letter to Sakharhov, which caused a
                    great stir in the Soviet Union. Now, Marshall Shulman was then the Special
                    Advisor to the Secretary for Soviet Affairs. As it turned out, I learned later
                    why he wanted me in this job. Because I had at some point when I was in the
                    office of Soviet affairs filled in for Hal Sonnenfeldt at the UN association
                    which was about to take a trip to Moscow. Cy Vance was on that delegation and
                    Marshall Shulman was putting it together. Apparently the briefing I gave was
                    something that had favorably impressed Marshall and so that's why I got this
                    job. I was closely involved with Marshall and of course he was close to Vance.
                    But Brzezinski and the people at NSC took a different line. So, that was a
                    constant struggle throughout that period having to deal with that. The Soviet
                    invasion of Afghanistan was in 1979, and preparations for martial law were
                    underway in Poland. So, it was a period of considerable turmoil. In arms control
                    we sought deep cuts in land based nuclear missiles going beyond those that had
                    been agreed in SALT. It was clear to me, and I think to Marshall, that it was
                    never going to happen, it was too radical a departure. You couldn't pass over
                    ratification of SALT to revise the agreement before it was ratified was
                    definitely not going to work. Although I don't think people either didn't care
                    or didn't realize it. It was ominous that we were going to do this. We went to
                    Moscow as part of the delegation led by Vance and Harold Brown to present this
                    to the Soviet leadership and I recall telling his people at that point, Les Gelb
                    in particular that I could predict with considerable certainty that they were
                    just going to reject this out of hand which they did. There was considerable
                    disappointment and bitterness at the delegation that there had been so little
                    progress.</p>

                        shot down?</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were people still moaning over why the Soviets didn't play
                        along or something. I mean to have a new administration, a new Secretary of
                        State that rebuffed sort of publicly right at the beginning, a damn fool way
                        to start off an administration in terms of sort of a certain amount of good
                        will?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: This was a year into the administration and the initial steps had not been
                    very promising. The Soviets have always been more comfortable with republicans
                    than with democrats. The emphasis during the campaign and the emphasis during
                    the early days of the administration and the persona of Brzezinski I don't think
                    promised very much to the Soviets. It's also clear from reading Dobrynin's
                    memoirs that at that stage in particular the machinery of the Soviet Union was
                    pretty much on automatic pilot. Nothing happened without the politburo endorsing
                    it whereas Brezhnev was in a state of physical decline, the people who had a lot
                    to say were people like Gromyko and Ustinov and they were not very they were
                    disappointed in the failure of detente as they saw it and the state of the U.S.
                    Soviet relations had been going down in the Nixon period. The Soviets still did
                    think that Watergate was basically the accomplishment of the enemies of detente
                    and they couldn't understand how a thing as trivial could have caused the
                    downfall of the Nixon presidency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't on your watch, but obviously you were sitting
                        there I mean meeting with them. What was the feeling in '79 when you came
                        in, why did the promising period of detente under Kissinger and all had
                        fallen this way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>BARRY: I think first and foremost the two sides have different expectations from
                    the idea of detente. The Soviets felt that this was a commitment to geopolitical
                    parity, that the Russians would be full partners. The two superpowers in the
                    world, that there was a commitment to the whole arms control area to parity in
                    all kinds of weapons, the Russians and their development of weapons systems and
                    the deployment of the SS-20 missiles in Europe we saw as decoupling, as
                    decoupling the U.S. from Europe. It was this whole thing combined with in '79 in
                    Afghanistan, which was very much seen by Brzezinski as the crisis of the drive
                    of the Soviet Union toward the Persian Gulf towards Pakistan in the south. We
                    had at that point considerable debate about what to do about the invasion of
                    Afghanistan. I remember one of the rather heated discussions on arming the
                    mujahedeen and the release of Stinger missiles and the idea that once you have
                    let these things out of the box you'd never get them back in again. Of course, I
                    was just reading a commentary by Brzezinski again who was asked about the wisdom
                    of this in light of such events and he still says that the result of the defeat
                    of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan was actually the dissolution of the Soviet
                    Union. From our point of view, we saw many people on our side saw the issue of
                    peaceful coexistence as a method by which what's mine is mine and what's yours
                    can be negotiated. So, that whole concept I think had been signed up by
                    Kissinger on this agreement for the prevention of war was very much under attack
                    by people who felt that signing up to this declaration was an unwise decision at
                    best.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there in '79 was there a feeling we were
                        going to try to repair relations or I mean on the State Department's side
                        where the Brzezinski and the National Security Council the Brzezinski group
                        was almost moving in a different direction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I don't think it was that stark. I think that on individual issues,
                    particularly arms control issues because to a large degree the compass of the
                    U.S. Soviet relations had increasingly been linked to the strategic arms
                    limitations talks. I think our goal was to try to get the strategic arms
                    agreement behind us, ratified, and then to move on in this and other arms
                    control areas. I think that we realized the depth of irritation of the Soviet
                    leadership didn't want public engagement of the president in some of these human
                    rights issues. But, it wasn't that they wanted to destroy U.S. Soviet relations
                    and we wanted to build them up. I think we placed more value on keeping a steady
                    course in the relations and trying to proceed based upon what had been
                    accomplished before. Of course a substantial amount of my time was spent on
                    Eastern Europe. That was a little different in the sense that this was not
                    Marshal Shulman's area. There was a lot going on around Eastern Europe at that
                    time and I made a couple of trips out there. Yugoslavia was important post at
                    that time. Larry Eagleburger was the ambassador. There were a number of
                    bilateral issues. This was a time when the relationship with Czechoslovakia was
                    very bad because they were still under the post Prague spring period. I'd say I
                    spent half of my time on Eastern Europe things.</p>

                        obviously went to December of '79, but Marshal Shulmann what was his role

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: He was a long time Soviet expert. He had been in the government back in
                    the Truman administration. He was at Columbia. He was head of the Russian
                    studies program at Columbia. He was a close friend of Cy Vance's and somebody
                    who had a very good understanding of the Soviet Union. He was also a wonderful
                    person. I was very close to him personally. He was not terribly well-equipped
                    for the bureaucratic sword fights that go on in Washington. He was too nice a
                    person. There were certainly lots of occasions in which Brzezinski took out
                    after him publicly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, sometimes when you put two people from the same

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I don't think Marshal was much of a bureaucrat. Brzezinski, actually
                    I knew Brzezinski, I went to Columbia back after leaving the navy, Brzezinski
                    had just come down from Harvard and I took a course from him. I don't think I
                    took a course from Marshal. Brzezinski, I think, reflected the heritage of his
                    Polish ancestors about Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you all evaluate the decision making process of
                        thKremlin? This was prior to the invasion of Afghanistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: It was pretty clear from Dobrynin's memoirs what it was like at that time.
                    That is, although Brezhnev was a dynamic and innovative personality in the early
                    stages of his career, by that time he was not at all. Everything passed through
                    the Politburo and the conservatives on the Politburo had the upper hand. The
                    people who had put a lot at stake for the improvement of the relations with the
                    U.S. and the development of detente were by that time pretty well discredited
                    because of the failure of the policy from the point of view of the Soviet Union.
                    People like Ustinov, who was the head of the military industrial complex, people
                    like the defense minister, Grechko, certainly had a much stronger position. The
                    attitude was, we're going to hold to our course because this was something that
                    we'd decided upon and it's right and we're not going to adjust.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, he was a candidate member of the politburo. He was not an equal
                    voice with the full members and he had always been a conservative in the sense
                    of somebody who was inflexible particularly at that stage of the game when he
                    realized that where the Politburo was going. He personally found Carter and
                    Brzezinski irritating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the Soviet Union we've come up to the events of a
                        larger part of '79 when all hell broke loose and Iran and Pakistan. In the
                        first place, did the takeover of our embassy in Iran have much of an effect
                        on what we were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: The U.S. government can at best deal with three crises at a time or two
                    crises at a time and the whole Iran thing preoccupied the government throughout
                    that period near the end of the Carter administration. Then of course as far as
                    this arc of crisis here is concerned in the sort of idea the this was a
                    dangerous aggressive move by the Soviet Union that certainly was the mood that
                    Brzezinski set at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had we been following Afghanistan and its relations with
                        thSoviet Union very high in our lookout list?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: It depends on what time you're talking about. I think in the early '70s it
                    was not, but towards the end of '79 certainly their activities in Afghanistan
                    and the increasing involvement of the Soviet Union were in our favor, were
                    periodically warning them don't do this, don't do that, especially in late '79
                    of course it didn't have much of an effect. If you look at it now from the point
                    of view of the Soviets, they looked at it as a defensive move because they saw
                    that the so-called progressive forces in Afghanistan were losing out. Dobrynin's
                    memoirs say that after the decision was made in the politburo in late '79 to go
                    into Afghanistan and the military came to Ustinov and Andropov and said we can't
                    do this. You're asking us to carry out a task that we're not trained for,
                    equipped for and they were told no, this is the decision of the politburo, you
                    go back and do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Soviets came in I guess it was just around

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, it was Christmas time because I was on leave and I hato come
                    back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you, was there, I won't say confusion, but I'm trying
                        to figure out what the hell this was all about because it seemed to be one
                        communist regime was replacing another communist regime and you know, the
                        commitment of the armed forces into another country, is a very major
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>BARRY: I don't think there was much debate about what it was about. The question
                    was what kind of sanctions do we take as a result of this. So, I think I came
                    back at Christmas and spent a lot of time drawing up the usual lists of well we
                    ought to do this, we ought to do that. The issue of grain sales, the issue of
                    Olympics I guess. Plus the usual small things and on the issue of support for
                    mujahedeen covert action and all those kinds of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One draws up these lists of sanctions, but is there a
                        feeling of I mean you know this is a case of don't stand there, do something
                        even though you know you're doing something that's not of any.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, I think there is a certain amount of truth to that. Although it was a
                    clear idea that you couldn't just react by saying that we had given several
                    public warnings about the consequences of going into Afghanistan - this is
                    because we had pretty good intelligence of the preparations to go in before
                    although not exact timing - you could tell what was going on and on the border
                    then was a build up in that direction. Having given the public warnings we
                    better do something, an action or a consequence. So, I don't think anybody who
                    was doing this felt there doing this against their better judgment although some
                    of things like grain sales were hotly debated at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where you looking for any indicator that this might be

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I don't think public opinion in the Soviet Union was a factoat that

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: It was a period of stagnation and they themselves now call it in
                    retrospect a period of stagnation and so there was not much going on either
                    economic reform or political organization. It was a regime with hardening of the

                <p>BARRY: Yes, I think there was a lot of speculation, but after all Brezhnev hung
                    on until when was it, '84? He held on for a long time. During that period of
                    course we had the summit in Vienna for the signing of the START agreement and I
                    recall we had tried to revise the agreement by putting a last minute proposal to
                    Brezhnev to cut some more heavy missiles. But I recall coming into the Hofburg
                    in Vienna and I was in the vicinity of Brezhnev as he was brought in and he
                    could not even lift his legs to move up the steps. Two great burly security
                    people had to lift him up the steps, kind of like a sack of potatoes and when I
                    saw that I thought that anybody who thinks that Brezhnev is going to suddenly
                    agree to a revision to this agreement that he's coming in to sign has got to be
                    crazy.</p>

                <p>BARRY: Yes, there was a lot of discussion of that and there was a lot of
                    realization, but once you put these weapons in their hands and began to
                    encourage people from around the Muslim world to come in there you were breeding
                    something that could not easily be controlled in the future. So, there were
                    various kinds of arguments. For example, there was a requirement when the war
                    was over you've got to turn back the stingers. That wasn't very realistic. There
                    were a lot of people, myself among them, who argued that we were doing something
                    that was irreversible, but the prevailing view in that case came from the
                    military and the NSC. Not from the military maybe from the OSD, but not from the
                    joint chiefs of staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would suspect that the military would be, it doesn't
                        like othepeople to get a hold of their goodies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, there was some talk about this falling into the hands
                    oterrorists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then moving on sort of over to the Eastern European
                        thing.What sort of thing, Poland, how did we see things in Poland in
                        '78?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Of course, this was a period of considerable tension inside Poland. This
                    was the growth of Solidarity. We understood the Soviet concerns about the
                    situation in Poland; as it is we had some pretty good intelligence sources
                    inside the senior Polish military telling us about preparations for martial law
                    or some kind of effort by the Soviets to put this under control. I forget when
                    John Paul II became Pope, but that obviously had a tremendous effect on opinion
                    within Poland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was around '78 or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>BARRY: I became a very close friend of the Polish ambassador here, Romuald
                    Spasowski, and his wife. He later defected in 1981 and we had many long
                    discussions. We were providing food aid to Poland and things like that.
                    Spasowski would first of all tell what his instructions were and then tell me
                    why he didn't agree with them. His wife was deeply religious and he was not.
                    After the Polish Pope came in he began to rapidly move in her direction and
                    became a devout Catholic. I think, in fact, his family was Protestant. Wanda
                    herself was extremely outspoken. They would go to meetings of the Warsaw Pact,
                    ambassadors and dinners and things like that and later come back and tell me
                    about all the things that transpired during those events. In fact, finally as he
                    was beginning to get closer and closer to a decision not defect we had several
                    of their things in our safe deposit box because we knew when he left he would be
                    unable to go back to the embassy and get these things. So, we understood that
                    pressure by the Soviet Union on Poland was getting more and more serious as time
                    went on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the feeling was that if martial law was declared
                        thSoviets might move in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, and that debate clearly had gone on and did go on in Moscow at the
                    time. Again it was the Soviet military, who said that this was not something we
                    can do, but they did have some preparations for this and we were aware of those
                    preparations. This was not so much '79; it was more '80 to '81. This was after
                    Afghanistan by that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there concern after Afghanistan that the Soviets
                        were in a sort of defensive role in the offensive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, that was certainly the view that most people had about Afghanistan.
                    When it comes to the Warsaw Pact and Poland, I think that was clearly seen as a
                    defensive move to avoid the crumbling of the Warsaw Pact and of course the East
                    Germans were egging the Russians on saying that they can't tolerate this type of
                    discipline in Poland without having to spill over the rest of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we making noises to the Soviets first of all, don't
                        do this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, around '80 or '81 we were saying it publicly, we were saying it
                    privately. There was not a discussion that took place that did not have that as
                    an underlying theme and what the consequences would be and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the consequences seeming at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>BARRY: I don't think anybody was thinking military, but more of the same, more
                    sanction. I think that after the declaration of martial law in '81, we decided
                    to cut off grain sales to Poland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you given any pressure from the Polish American
                        community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Oh, yes, and of course, in this case the Polish ambassador who was on the
                    side of the Polish-American community. Gronowski was postmaster general in the
                    Carter administration. Of course, there were a lot of very prominent people
                    including some of the people in the Voice of America who were also prominent
                    Polish Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Czechoslovakia, was this beyond the pale at that

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, there was nothing going on there. It was a hardline regime and after
                    '68 they were sort of consigned to the dust heap.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: East Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I mean we had diplomatic relations. We had aambassador there, but
                    again it was not movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hungary is always a little bit squishy, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, and the Hungarians were innovative in terms of their economic policy,
                    the relationship with the Hungarian government was pretty good. I made a couple
                    of trips there. They were trying to be sort of bridge with the Soviet leadership
                    and to try to moderate some of the things that were coming out of Moscow at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the sort of the East European reaction when the
                        Sovietinvaded Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: The Hungarians looked at it from 1956 in a sense. They were not involved.
                    There were some contingents from some Eastern Europe military that went into
                    Afghanistan but it was not something that they were enthusiastic about. It was
                    not seen as a Warsaw Pact issue. I also think that they felt that the Soviets
                    had bitten off more than they could chew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Romania and Ceausescu?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>BARRY: Romania and Ceausescu had a special close relationship. They were
                    unliberal in domestic policy, but in terms of foreign policy, they were carrying
                    out a separate course. They were always presenting themselves as a potential
                    opening to somewhere or other. Of course, they had brokered some of the openings
                    to China in the Nixon administration. It was certainly seen as the most
                    important of the Warsaw Pact countries and again we devoted a lot of attention
                    to what the Romanians were saying and doing on issues like Afghanistan. They
                    were outspoken critics of what the Russians had done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we trying to put any pressure on Ceausescu to loosen
                        up ihis own country and his human rights side was pretty appalling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, yes, I do recall calling a meeting with the ambassador from time to
                    time and taking him to task about one thing or another going on, but I don't
                    think anybody had any serious thought that Ceausescu was going to turn over a
                    new leaf. A sort of trade off was that if you could be seen to be active in the
                    foreign policy sense side that that was a fair enough trade off for domestic
                    repression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bulgaria, did it, was it again sort of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: No, nothing was happening in Bulgaria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of contenture of Eastern Europe, did any, what
                        was your impression of how the embassies operate? Did any of them have or
                        did any of them at all affect dealing with the congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: During the Cold War the Poles always had an effective embassy under
                    Spasowski; they spent a lot of time talking to people in congress. The
                    Romanians, also the Romanian ambassador, were active. The Romanian ambassador,
                    Cornelin Bogdan, was a very outspoken person rather critical of Ceausescu and I
                    think he finally also ended up leaving the government and living here. Of course
                    the Yugoslavs that was the time when Loncar was ambassador and he was quite
                    effective as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, lets talk about Yugoslavia during this Soviet '81
                        period.Tito was dead by this time, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>BARRY: Tito died, well I went to his funeral, so it must have been '79, something
                    like that. Well, we had Loncar here who was a very experienced person- he was
                    ambassador in Indonesia in '65 in “the year of living dangerously” and so forth.
                    I was also quite personally close to him and his wife. Eagleburger was very
                    effective in Belgrade- he was doing a lot at that point to promote stability in
                    Yugoslavia in the post-Tito era and to provide various kinds of assistance in
                    exchanges and things like that in trying to promote economic reform.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It appears in a way that the threat of the Soviet Union
                        doing something in Yugoslavia was probably one of the main causes of keeping
                        Yugoslavia together after Tito. Do you think that was the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, of course that had been the thrust of U.S. policy to Yugoslavia on
                    and off since 1947. Vance had seen Afghanistan and what had happened in Poland,
                    and there were concerns in Yugoslavia that something similar could happen there.
                    It certainly caused the Yugoslavs to take a serious view of any kind of
                    separatism or anything of that kind within Yugoslavia itself. But I don't think
                    we thought seriously that there was much of an issue of Soviet intervention into
                    Yugoslavia at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean, probably in hindsight, but at the time, did
                        we seereally concerned about the break up of Yugoslavia with Tito gone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I don't think so, we were concerned about how the leadership was going to
                    straighten itself out and how the system of rotation was going to be with a real
                    effect to economic reform or anything like that, but I don't think anybody at
                    that point thought seriously that Yugoslavia was on the verge of breakup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in '81 the Reagan administration came in. How did
                        that, did you feel that there was, after the election and before the
                        transition took place, was there sort of a feeling of oh my God we're going
                        to go back to the that sort of Cold War. Ronald Reagan had had this
                        reputation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>BARRY: Oh, yes, most decidedly and when the transition team appeared it was kind
                    of scary in terms of what they were saying about policy particularly towards my
                    part of the world. Well, in the last administration they had decided to pick me
                    up for ambassador to Romania. But when Eagleburger was designated as assistant
                    secretary, he told me that one of the conditions was that we had to get rid of
                    all the people who had worked on Soviet affairs in the last administration and
                    so I was one of them and should be prepared to go when the new administration
                    came in. It was Dick Pipes who was the transition person for the Soviet Union
                    and Eastern Europe and it was clear talking to him that things were going to be
                    reversed. So, come the 20th of January I left, I stayed on for a couple of weeks
                    and the administration of the State Department sent my name over to the White
                    House for Romania, but then Jesse Helms discovered that there was a professor
                    from a small college in North Carolina who had been a Fulbright student from
                    Romania. His name was David Funderbark and he had written to Jesse and tried to
                    get an appointment with the Defense Intelligence Agency as a Romanian expert.
                    They decided he should be ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you're talking about Funderbark?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, so he got the Romanian appointment. So, as a consolation prize they
                    put me up for Bulgaria, which is not a very exciting prospect, but it was better
                    than walking the streets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were ambassador to Bulgaria from when to

                <p>BARRY: Certainly it wasn't an issue- no political appointees wantethe job nor did
                    anybody much care.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I was about to say this, I mean, when you arrived
                        there had you known that Bulgaria was sort of becoming the terrorist center
                        of Eastern Europe or one of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Of course, there was a lot of talk about this. The issue of the
                    involvement of Bulgaria and the secret service in terrorist activities probably
                    was somewhat exaggerated. Clearly they were involved in the assassination of
                    Markov. There was never any evidence that they were really involved in the
                    assassination of the pope and there was a big effort to demonstrate otherwise.
                    The CIA couldn't come up with any positive connection. Zhivkov of course thought
                    that this was particularly aimed at him and at one stage of the game he took me
                    aside and said to me, “You know we're having lots of problems with the Soviet
                    Union ourselves. They are not being very sympathetic to us. They are not giving
                    us the same kind of subsidies that they used to for our economy and so forth. If
                    you can arrange for the American press to stop talking about our involvement in
                    the assassination of the pope, America could become our best friend and we could
                    be in a position to reverse our alliances.” I said to him in a polite way,
                    “Well, if I were powerful enough to do that I wouldn't be here in Bulgaria.”
                    But, clearly he felt that he was personally being victimized by the U.S.
                    government and I guess there's some speculation that there were some elements
                    that the Bulgarian secret service were involved in this without the knowledge of
                    the government itself. There was never any hard evidence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in the first place you mentioned Claire Sterling.
                        Yomight explain who she was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: She's an author of who was resident in Rome and wrote a lot of books. She
                    was a right-wing ideologue and it was her book on the papal assassination which
                    was the primary evidence for this. Now, of course, Casey was the head of the CIA
                    at that time and the instructions from Casey were to find out about this. I
                    think the agency tried hard to find out about it, but there was no clear
                    evidence. This Turk who was involved was the person who pointed the finger at
                    the Bulgarians but he was kind of crazy himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean this was a failed assassination attempt?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, he was shot and wounded, but not killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about relations with Yugoslavia? As an old Yugoslavia
                        hand you must have been dealing with this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, David Anderson was in Belgrade at that time and we visited back and
                    forth quite a few times. Of course the Yugoslavs had always been anti-Bulgarian.
                    The Yugoslav ambassador in Bulgaria had been the editor of Politika and was a
                    very smart person who had a lot of information about what was going on in
                    Bulgaria so we exchanged information a lot. His house was burned down and he
                    suspected that the Bulgarians were behind that. This was of course the Macedonia
                    issue. The Yugoslavs really thought the Bulgarians were probably involved in
                    efforts to trying to destabilize the situation in Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Bulgaria's relations with Romania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I don't think there was much going on there. The issue of relations with
                    Turkey was more active because this was the period when there were a lot of
                    Bulgarian Turks who wanted to leave and the I guess the Turkish consul in
                    Plovdiv was shot at.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had a Turkish consul in Los Angeles was killed around
                        that time, too, no that was earlier, much earlier by the Armenian
                        Revolutionary or something. I mean, were we trying to do anything to sort of
                        keep the Turks and Bulgarians living quietly with each other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, we made a lot of representations to the Bulgarian government about
                    treatment of the Turkish minority, that they should be allowed to basically give
                    them equal rights. There was an effort at that time to make all the Turks to
                    change their names to Slavic names and forbid people from speaking Turkish. We
                    argued with them about that. Of course, the Bulgarians were death on the Reagan
                    administration. Interestingly enough at that point Armand Hammer came through.
                    He had always prided himself of being in with whoever was in with the Kremlin at
                    that time, but he couldn't get Andropov to give him the time of day. So, he came
                    to see Zhivkov to intercede with Andropov to receive Armand Hammer which
                    eventually I guess Andropov did although it was not a marriage made in
                    heaven.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of the Soviet ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>BARRY: Oh, he was an amusing character. Of course, he had just come from being
                    second secretary of the provincial party organization in Kazakhstan and he and
                    his wife used to have dinner together occasionally and say oh we were treated
                    like kings out there. The second secretary was the de facto ruler of the
                    republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kazakhs, but the power behind that, the eminence grise was
                        thparty secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, he had complained about the Bulgarians not being as nearly as ready
                    to do their bidding as the Kazakhs were. There were some stresses and strains in
                    relations at that time and of course the Russians had been bleeding themselves
                    dry subsidizing these economies. They sold oil to the Bulgarians at comecon
                    prices which were one-tenth the world market prices and the Bulgarians would
                    turn around and sell the oil on the world market at their prices and it didn't
                    appeal a lot to the Soviets. All of these kinds of things that kept the
                    Bulgarians going were subsidies from Moscow and the subsidies were being cut
                    back and that caused a lot of stresses within the Bulgarian body politic. There
                    were some people rising at the time within Bulgaria who were potential
                    challenges to Zhivkov who prided himself on being the longest serving anybody in
                    Eastern Europe, but that was all contained because Zhivkov kept shifting people
                    around to make sure that they didn't develop a power base.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with Zhivkov?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: His daughter was actually more interesting. Ljadmila Zhivicova, who had
                    gone to Oxford and spoke English well, and she was an annoyance to the Soviets
                    because she was fond of saying things like, “It was the missionaries who taught
                    the Russians how to speak or write and put the language in writing so that the
                    Soviets were not really Bulgarians, they were Greek,” but nevertheless the
                    Bulgarians claimed them and she asserted the strong superiority of Bulgarian
                    culture and all those things. Eventually she died and the suspicion around was
                    that the Russians had poisoned her. Zhivkov himself was a not very interesting
                    personality I would say. He was kind of colorless and he had houses in every
                    town. He was worse than Tito in terms of villas per capita.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there in the early years of the Reagan
                        administration, taking a very strong hard right Cold War attitude at the
                        beginning. Maybe I'm over characterizing this, but did you find sort of
                        instructions or requests or something coming out of there at the beginning?
                        Was it difficult to deal with from the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>BARRY: No, not really. I guess the issue we had to deal with most publicly was
                    the issue of the Pershings and the SS-20s and all of that kind of thing, but we
                    didn't have any trouble presenting that issue as being an issue that had to be
                    faced. Bulgaria was not very high on the list.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left there in '84. I think this is probably a
                        gooplace to stop. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, eventually, I went off for a year. I was a diplomat in residence at
                    Dartmouth. Then from there I went to the head of the U.S. Delegation to the
                    Stockholm Conference on Confidence Building and Security Measures in Europe for
                    a year and a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. Well, we'll pick that up then. Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 6th of December, 2001. Bob, let's talk a bit abouDartmouth. You were
                    there from '84 to '85?</p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes. Dartmouth was my alma mater and I didn't have anything immediately to
                    do after I left Bulgaria so I talked to the president of Dartmouth who had been
                    a year ahead of me at Dartmouth and I became the first John Sloan Dickey Fellow.
                    They had started the Dickey endowment, named that for the president of Dartmouth
                    at the time I had been there who was also one of the founding fathers of the UN
                    and this endowment had a fellowship, so as a diplomat in residence I was also
                    the Dickey Fellow. Although I wanted to teach courses for credit, the faculty
                    wasn't particularly interested in that. So, what I did was lecture in other
                    peoples' courses and gave a seminar not for credit on issues having to do with
                    arms control. That was a pleasant year. Our kids, our two sons were in school
                    respectively at Amherst and Yale, so we had a chance to spend time with them. I
                    helped start the International Affairs Journal that they started up during that
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in the first place what changes did you notice at
                        Dartmoutand in the student body?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, first of all Dartmouth, when I had been there it habeen an all men's
                    school. Now it was coeducational.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't girls ruin it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>BARRY: No, actually the place was improved greatly by the addition of women. I
                    think it was a better school academically and a better school socially and all
                    that. Of course, there had been a lot of new building in connection with that in
                    terms of new dormitories and new science buildings and things like that. We also
                    were ski instructors for young children. This was a program that the college put
                    together so we spent time doing that as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well informed did you feel the students were regarding
                        foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, the only students who sought me out were people who were positively
                    interested in it. In general, however, I would have to say, they were less well
                    informed than they were when I had been there as an undergraduate because Dickey
                    had set up this so called Great Issues program. Everybody was required to take
                    it. This brought in speakers from all over the world and we were required to
                    read the foreign affairs stories in the newspapers everyday and things like
                    that. So, overall I would say there was decline in interest in foreign affairs.
                    The people I talked to were the people who came to my seminars and were people
                    who were interested in foreign affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did find and interest in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, but it was a self-selected group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you feel that knowing the phantom of the faculty
                        anall, where did you feel the students were bound by and large?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I suppose most of them were bound for careers in business, which was
                    the case, when I was there as well. Not so many for government jobs of one kind
                    or another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think I, talking to faculty members at Williams,
                        said well, it is a little hard to get overly excited about training these
                        future investment bankers about culture and all that. Were there any issues
                        that particularly were roiling in the campus at all in the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, this was the early days of “Star Wars” and so there were the
                    discussions of arms control, that was a major topic of discussion, but we had
                    experts on both sides. But other than that, I don't think there was anything in
                    particular. It was not a very activist time. These were the days of the end of
                    the first Reagan administration. The student body was marginally I think pretty
                    conservative.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then after your year in '85, whither, you went to
                        where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes. The Stockholm Conference on Confidence Building Measures and Security
                    in Europe had been going on for almost a year. Jim Goodby was the head of the
                    U.S. delegation, but he had a family crisis and had to come home. I was asked to
                    take his place. I was delighted to do so, but just before I had left for
                    Stockholm in September or August of '85, our younger son, Peter, died in a
                    fishing vessel accident in Alaska. That was quite a shock to us and I had a real
                    question about whether I should go ahead and go off to Stockholm or not under
                    the circumstances. George Vest who was then Director General of the Foreign
                    Service was very kind in advising me to go ahead and do it and was in agreement
                    to send Peggy out from time to time to visit me there because it was going to be
                    fairly intensive negotiations. I was supposed to go in August, but we had to
                    take care of the burial of our son and all that kind of thing and we also began
                    something that was all absorbing for Peggy, after I left. This was to try to
                    improve rules having to do with fishing vessel safety. I had been in the navy
                    myself and I was shocked to learn that the boat that my son was on was more than
                    70 years old was in terrible shape, had no life saving equipment onboard, that
                    the skipper had been on cocaine. So, we decided that we would lobby with the
                    congress to get this regulatory regime changed. The Jones Act, which is the
                    basic law governing maritime affairs specifically, forbade any kind of
                    regulation for fishing vessels. So, without legislation you couldn't even
                    require a fishing vessel to have a life raft onboard. So, in August or September
                    I looked into all this and began to contact people about it, but in
                    mid-September I left and went to Stockholm and left this in Peggy's hands. She
                    became quite active and testified several times in Congress; the net result of
                    this was that there was congressional legislation passed that required fishing
                    vessels to have survival equipment onboard and people would be trained to use
                    it. That incidentally has had an impact on safety in fishing vessel industry. In
                    fact, there's a CNN special that is coming out in a few days that in part deals
                    with our role in this fishing vessel issue, but it also has to do with some of
                    the more recent fishing vessel accidents.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the opposition coming from, the fishing

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Fishing vessel owners who did not want to have the additional expense of
                    this. The Alaska Delegation in Congress was against it because they are pretty
                    libertarian on these issues. There was a proposal to require that there be
                    survival equipment in return for a cap on tort claims having to do with deaths
                    in the fishing vessel industry and that was something that the trial lawyers
                    were strongly against. On the other side, Peggy put together a coalition of
                    mothers of people, girlfriends and wives of people who had been killed. They
                    testified and we got some pretty good support from a number of people in both
                    houses of Congress including the chair of the Merchant Marine Fisheries
                    Committee of the House and so eventually, although it wasn't until 1988 that the
                    law was finally passed, but it did go through.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>BARRY: This had been something that the Russians had strongly wanted because they
                    were very much in favor of the security basket of CSCE, the Conference on
                    Security and Cooperation in Europe. This was something that was under the
                    auspices of CSCE. It was the first arms control conference to be done under CSCE
                    auspices. The purpose was to create a structure of confidence building measures
                    having to do with conventional forces which would help to provide early warning
                    of unusual military events, to require people to advise of major military
                    maneuvers, to invite observers, etc. The key controversial issue was on site
                    verification. This was something the U.S. strongly insisted upon and of course
                    the Russians strongly resisted. The participants of course included all the CSCE
                    members. So, it was the neutral and non-aligned as well as the Warsaw Pact and
                    NATO. We had by far the toughest position in NATO. It was driven by the
                    Pentagon, as you will recall there was some considerable tension between Schultz
                    and Weinberger about these issues in general. At that point we had broken off
                    all other arms control discussions with the Russians. So, this was the only arms
                    control discussion that involved Russia and the United States at the time and
                    thus it took on an unusually high public profile. In fact whenever Jim Goodby
                    and later I came back to the U.S. for consultations we were received by the
                    president, the vice president, the secretary of state, the secretary of defense,
                    the whole national security team to provide reports about progress in
                    negotiations. I'm quite sure it was the wish of many in the office of the
                    secretary of defense to have this thing not succeed because among other things,
                    they were not so keen on having onsite verification of the U.S. military
                    activities, but it had to be a two way street. My Russian opposite member was a
                    man named Grinevsky, a very intelligent, very cultured Soviet diplomat and we
                    got along well personally, but of course, there had been no progress for a very
                    long time. By the time I got there, there was a kind of deadline of, the clock
                    was supposed to run out in I think it was August of 1986 and as we got closer to
                    that deadline the discussions accelerated. Of course, this was the time of
                    Gorbachev and so it was we were trying to figure out whether Gorbachev would put
                    a new face on the negotiation. The sticking point was, as I say, the on site
                    inspection and we had said several times we would walk away from the negotiation
                    in the absence of any strong provision on on site verification. We didn't have a
                    lot of support in NATO for that. I think many people in NATO thought it was
                    unrealistic. The neutral and non-aligned had their own reasons for not liking on
                    site inspections. The Swiss, for example, have got a kind of volunteer force
                    that depends a great deal on secrecy and the secrecy of where their bases are,
                    where their arms are stored, things like that. The Swedes, for that matter, had
                    the same kind of system in place. The idea that they would have to open their
                    borders to on site inspection to see about military maneuvers or to check about
                    whether reports of where their troops were stationed or where their exercises
                    were being held didn't appeal very much to them. But we kept the pressure on and
                    they were of course back channel discussions with the Russians as well. I think
                    we made it clear that without this it was, the U.S. was not going to take part
                    in this negotiation and it was going to fall apart. I guess the key factor came
                    in probably August of '86 when Marshall Akhromeyev who was the chief of the
                    general staff came to Stockholm and announced that yes, Russia had changed its
                    mind about on site inspection. They would be willing to do it, not only would
                    they be willing to do it, we would find that they were more enthusiastic about
                    it than we were. But then of course, they wanted to include things like on site
                    inspection in the United States. They wanted to include operations of naval
                    vessels and things like that none of which we could agree to. The deadline for
                    the negotiations to conclude came and went. We stopped the clock and pretended
                    it was still August as it went into September and eventually we got within sight
                    of agreement. This made the Pentagon very unhappy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, my delegation was made up of representatives of the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff, representatives of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Arms
                    Control and Disarmament Agency, the State Department, the CIA, and USIA; it was
                    a big delegation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There must have been, I mean, were the battles being
                        fought oyour delegation, or were they reporting to their masters and it
                        was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: The answer to that question is yes to both parts of it. The battles were
                    fought within the delegation, and particularly the OSD contingent was reporting
                    back to the OSD.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OSD is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: The Office of the Secretary of Defense. That included Richard Perle, who
                    was the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs then at the Pentagon. In
                    the end game there were several discussions of course with the chiefs in the
                    tank at the Pentagon and so forth that I had participated in, but in the end I
                    guess it was a discussion between Weinberger and Schultz and the president and
                    the vice president. The last instructions I got were basically that I had a
                    green light to get the best deal I could. That was leaked to the press, I
                    presume by the Pentagon, which of course made the whole end game extremely
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh God yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Here I was trying to get more out of the whole negotiation at the end and
                    here the press had it that I was free to agree to anything that I wanted to. We
                    did hold out successfully at the end. I think it was kind of strange because I
                    would go to see Reagan when I came back on these things and we had these
                    discussions in the Oval Office. It was clear to me that he didn't have a clue
                    about what this was all about, but it was the only arms control discussion going
                    on so it was important. I think this was the stage at which Reagan beginning to
                    change his mind about dealings with the Soviet Union. Having this be a success
                    rather than to have it collapse was a major issue at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the national security advisor? BARRY: Bud
                        McFarland.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he play much of a role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: No, at least not that I saw. Schultz has written about this in his own
                    memoirs that the main issue was between State and Defense. My deputy was from
                    DOD, but he was a very constructive force in all this because he well understood
                    the military aspects of the whole thing and certainly was not interested in
                    seeing the whole thing collapse. As I say this thing came to a conclusion in
                    September. It was the first ever arms control agreement providing for on site
                    inspection, so it got, it was a precedent setting event because of course the
                    subsequent discussions of theater nuclear weapons also had to provide for on
                    site inspections. One of the reasons we were holding the line so much here was
                    to make that sure that that precedent was set for the future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, I mean, when you're talking about
                        onsitinspections at that time, what were you talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: We were talking about the ability to send in a team to let's say that the
                    Russians said there was a major military exercise going on in an area that was
                    not open to foreign travel in the Soviet Union and we chose to use one of our
                    quota of on site inspections to go there and see if it was in fact the kind of
                    exercise that they had notified. We would be allowed to send a team in on very
                    short notice and be escorted around to see what was going on. Or they didn't
                    notify of an exercise, but that we detected that one was one going on, say a
                    mobilization exercise or a transfer of forces or something like that, we would
                    be entitled to go in and look at that, too. Now there were reciprocal rights
                    that the Russians had in Europe, at the end it was very difficult to bring the
                    Swedes and the Swiss and others along because they had assumed from the
                    beginning that this would never succeed and we would never get an on site
                    inspection regime. When it became that the Russians and the Americans were going
                    to agree on it, they began to worry about their own defense plans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there any thought, I mean these being neutral
                        powers osaying okay, you're out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: That would not have worked. No, there wasn't any thought given to it
                    because the Russians would have said it has got to be for everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because neither were part of anybody's pact and let me
                        just puthe. So, I mean you have, how did you reach this accord?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, what you always do in these things it has to be by consensus. If one
                    country opts out, then there's no agreement, but there was a lot of public
                    pressure on this at this time. Of course, the neutrals and non-aligned, being
                    holier than thou, always accusing the U.S. of not wanting real arms control, so
                    it would have been awkward for them to opt out on the basis of their
                    unwillingness to see inspections on their own territory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean you do have this imbalance, the Soviet Union is
                        part of, you know it considers itself part of Europe and so you would have
                        an exercise in Kazakhstan and you can go there, but you can't look and see
                        what's happening in Kansas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, that was a point that the Russians did not cease making, but we said
                    this is the whole CSCE is about territory of Europe, admittedly Europe to the
                    Urals, but that doesn't include the continental United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they beyond the Urals through Kansas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I don't recall whether that was a sticking point or not, but we just said
                    no and that was about it. I mean we were quite credible in saying that this did
                    not turn out the way that we wanted, we would back out of the whole thing. I
                    think I said it on every occasion when I made a speech, which I did fairly
                    often.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, I mean, how did you find Defense, what was
                        Defense'attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Their attitude was arms control agreements with the Soviets are worthless,
                    that they don't live up to them, that we would get into these prolonged
                    negotiations and the benefits are outweighed by the costs of doing these kinds
                    of things and so we shouldn't be involved in them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that Richard Perle was a driving force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I'm not sure that there was any difference between Perle and
                    Weinberger on these issues. The Joint Chiefs took a much more relaxed attitude
                    in fact the Joint Chiefs figured there was some useful information that would
                    come out of this that we didn't have ourselves before and therefore the benefits
                    in fact outweighed the cost. So, as usual, there was a difference between the
                    Chiefs and the civilian leadership.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think, you know, just looking at it as a situation
                        in those days that I mean we had a hell of a time penetrating the Soviet
                        Union and looking at things, they had us covered from A to Z practically
                        with spies and all in fairly open society, so you know, I think this would
                        be, I would think the CIA would be delighted for example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Oh, the CIA was for it. The arms control and disarmament agency was kind
                    of two minds, the head of ACDA at that point was Ken Adleman and he was on the
                    Weinberger side of the issue. It was a good delegation. We did an awful lot of
                    public diplomacy traveling around to the CSCE member states, meeting with them
                    and having press conferences and all that trying to build support for this. It
                    got a lot of coverage in the U.S. since it was the only game in town at the
                    time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: The people who were most enthusiastic about this and pressed hardest for
                    an agreement and were most upset sometimes about our hardline position were the
                    Germans. This was of special importance to Germany because it had to do with the
                    movement of conventional forces. Moves that could be threatening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's where the battle would be fought.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes. The Nordics were all very much engaged in this with Stockholm being
                    the host of the conference and so the Swedes played an important role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the, you know, East Germany, Poland,
                        Czechoslovakia,were they jumping to the Soviet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: There was no daylight between any of the Warsaw Pact memberon these
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to see a difference when you were talking
                        sort of on the side to save the Poles or something like that or were
                        theidelegations pretty disciplined?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I don't think their delegations did a lot of freewheeling discussions. My
                    main effort was devoted at keeping the NATO caucus together because we would
                    meet on a regular basis and there was a lot of potential for dissent within the
                    NATO group, so you had to keep them in line. I remember the Portuguese became
                    particularly difficult. Well, Portuguese are often that way and the Italians
                    were pretty soft on most of these things. The other main effort was with the
                    Russians themselves. So, that was where I spent most of my time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, I think they were. Nobody was as hard over as we were.So, we were the
                    sort of whip with a NATO hoop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they sort of roll their eyes when Weinberger was
                        mentioned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, they certainly knew within our own delegation the differences were
                    quite clear because the OSD representative would go around and threaten they
                    would pull the plug on the negotiation if there was any sign of weakness on the
                    delegation position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were other talks going on at this time? I'm always a
                        little confused on this. There are the three baskets. There was the one that
                        was on borders and to acknowledge that the borders would stay firm, which is
                        what the Soviets wanted very much. They wanted to keep the oder line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, by this time of course the Helsinki Final Act was long since put to
                    bed. That was 1974. So, this was part of the Final Act. After the Final Act was
                    approved the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe had a
                    quasi-permanent presence in Vienna, but this sprung out of the conference and it
                    was a separate activity under basket one. It had long been the Russian desire to
                    enliven the security aspects of the dialogue as opposed to the economic or human
                    rights baskets. This got started in I guess it must have been '83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was driving the Soviets in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, as you say they were most interested in developing the security
                    basket. They wanted to emphasize the permanence of the division in Europe. They
                    wanted to have a security forum in which they participated and they still do for
                    that matter. You see this now going on about NATO because they don't' like the
                    idea that NATO makes decisions about things and then brings it to the
                    Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and tries to get OSCE to
                    make decisions having to do with things like Macedonia or Central Asia or things
                    like that. They wanted to keep; they wanted to have a voice in European security
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, where stood the nuclear arms control type
                        things,nuclear and conventional?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>BARRY: Nowhere at that point because we had broken off the strategic arms
                    discussions. The question about theater nuclear weapons was hung up at that
                    point. Remember the zero option, we were saying that the only possibility was
                    both sides to withdraw intermediate range nuclear weapons from Europe. I think
                    towards the end of this period the discussions about intermediate range weapons
                    got started again. Paul Nitze was the head of the U.S. negotiating team and that
                    was concluded sometime later. There had been the Mutual and Balanced Force
                    Reduction talks (MBFR), but they were also suspended at that time. At the time I
                    went there, there was nothing else going on in terms of arms control
                    discussions. MBFR started up towards the end of that period or became active
                    toward the end of that period and finally ended up in the CFE Treaty, the treaty
                    on Conventional Forces in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any inclinations or more than that that
                        the Soviet Union was beginning to have, you know, a leadership crisis,
                        wither it was going and all that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, by that time, at least by '84, the leadership crisis was over
                    because you've buried Brezhnev, Andropov and Chernenko and Gorbachev was in and
                    Gorbachev was talking about Glasnost and restructuring and Perestroika and all
                    that kind of thing. We got the indication towards the middle of '85 was that the
                    Russians were less rigid in issues like the on site inspections and that opened
                    the way for CFE and theater nuclear weapons discussions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern that the Soviets might start cranking up
                        agaiunder a new more vigorous leadership or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: You mean, was there a threatening posture? I don't think so. I mean the
                    whole emphasis in the Gorbachev period was deal with the problems at home. Of
                    course, this was during the “Star Wars” period so they were being driven hard to
                    keep up with us in terms of spending and nuclear conventional weapons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern at that time about some sort of an
                        agreement, I mean when you had these things going between the Soviets and
                        the Europeans and the United States that somehow or another West Germany and
                        East Germany might join together as a neutral lump in the middle of
                        Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, that was always an underlying fear that people had about the
                    neutralization of Germany and it's a fear that the East Germans had as well
                    because the East Germans were not pleased at all about glasnost and perestroika.
                    Gorbachev came to East Germany and publicly advised them to loosen up on things
                    and that sort of began the crumbling. I think the greatest concern at least
                    among the State Department people was that we would further open the gap between
                    ourselves and the rest of NATO on arms control issues and that this would weaken
                    our posture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, anyway, were you getting anything from our
                        headquarters in Heidelberg saying you're really opening up a can of worms or
                        something like this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I think generally the U.S. command in Europe was happy enough with this
                    whole thing. It did in fact make life simpler for them to have advance
                    notification of conventional military activities. Of course, all of our guidance
                    came through the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We didn't
                    get any lateral discussion, but I did go to visit both SACEUR and CINC/USACEUR,
                    the usual people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to capture the period, I mean, while we were looking
                        for this, this was not a time when we were particularly concerned about a
                        sudden build up in a dash through the Fulda gap by the Warsaw Pact forces
                        was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: That was the original focus for the American forces in Europe. They were
                    poised to repel such an activity and the theory was that in order to do such a
                    thing there would be a period of preparation where people would be operating out
                    of garrisons. It was the desire to capture “out of garrison activities.” That
                    drove this issue of on site verification because we would get indications that
                    an infantry division had moved its equipment out of garrison and was moving
                    somewhere else, but they would do it by night and we wouldn't see it and so
                    that's why we wanted to have this ability to inspect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we getting any, were you getting from your military
                        colleagues, the CIA or something readings on the state of military
                        preparedness and effectiveness of the Soviet forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, we certainly had had all the intelligence that anybody else had at
                    that time, both the compartmentalized intelligence intercepts, satellite
                    activities and things like that, but there was not really a sense that this was
                    an empty shell, that it was, that the Soviet military was in poor condition.
                    This may have been the case when you got back into the hinterland, but the front
                    line divisions in East Germany and so forth were in pretty good shape.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that's my understanding. Well, then, you left in
                        '86?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: The thing was concluded in September of '86.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was concluded. Then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, then I didn't have anything to do immediately so I camback and sort
                    of sniffed around at what might come next.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, in having worked on a hard negotiation like
                        this and coming out with a treaty, did you, you would think the State
                        Department would say, “Boy we got something for you after doing that.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Schultz made a public statement of praise for the delegation and me
                    personally. Anyhow eventually well, actually I guess they were looking for
                    somebody to be the chief operating officer of the Voice of America and the job
                    was first offered to Jim Goodby who didn't want it. He told me that they were
                    looking for somebody to do this and so I went to talk to the head of the Voice
                    of America, Dick Carlson and lacking anything else to do I agreed to take on
                    that job. I was the deputy director of the Voice of America which was a largely
                    management job at that point. Before I'd been on the Voice of America as the
                    head of the USSR division. Dick Carlson was not much of a hands on manager, so
                    that, the budget the reshaping of the Voice of America to cut out some services
                    and add others and so forth were all in my department. It was not a sixteen hour
                    a day a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in a way you wanted this, didn't you, with a certain
                        amounof decompression coming back home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, not particularly, I'm not for decompressing, it was the best thing
                    available at the time. Charlie Wick was then the head of the U.S. Information
                    Agency; a very close friend of the president's of course and certainly of the
                    hardline persuasion. The Deputy Director of the U.S. Information Agency was
                    Marvin Stone who'd been the editor of Newsweek and was also kind of a hands on
                    person at USIA. I think most of that period which went from '86 or maybe it was
                    the beginning of '87 until it must have been '89 I guess was involved with
                    trying to stay within the budgetary parameters, trying to do things like
                    increase what we're doing in China at that time which was a big issue. We were
                    broadcasting to China, putting in new transmitters around the world. We had just
                    reached a deal to create a whole wave of new transmitters- one was to be in
                    Israel, one of them was in Thailand, and one somewhere in Turkey I guess. We
                    were doing those things. Those were big capital investments. I ended up for my
                    sins being in charge of one of the stupidest projects that we ever put together,
                    which was TV Marti.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God. Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I was given this job to do I think intentionally by Wick, thinking to get
                    somebody who was a career diplomat responsible for this would give it a degree
                    of respectability it might not otherwise have had. This was driven by the Cuban
                    American Foundation, which had a great deal of influence. Jorge Mass. I spent a
                    lot of time with Jorge. We said from the outset that technically it was not
                    going to work, that it's much easier to jam television signals than it is to jam
                    radio signals and that short of putting it on a ship or something that would
                    bring it close to shore, which would run all kinds of other dangers, you
                    couldn't ever beat the physics of it. No was not an appropriate answer. So,
                    eventually we came up with this idea of putting this big barrage balloon over
                    the Florida Keys and we put the antenna up on top. The balloon flew away
                    occasionally, but that was another story. It would send the signal down to Cuba,
                    but of course it couldn't get through the jamming. Some people could get it
                    between the hours of 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning or something like that, but it
                    was basically for the benefit of Jorge Mass and the Cuban American Foundation
                    rather than listeners. It's still going on today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this more of an employment opportunity for their
                        people a sort of patronage or actually they watch it in Havana and
                        Miami?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: No, I don't think they could watch it in Miami and of course, we were
                    forbidden by law to broadcast it to the American public. No, it was basically
                    part of the liberation philosophy that eventually, well, I guess it was kind of
                    like driving the Russians broke that eventually would cost so much to jam the
                    thing and that would help to drain the Cuban economy. But it was very popular
                    among the people down there. Well, eventually for that and other services to the
                    USIA I got the Distinguished Honor Award from USIA, but I was always a little
                    bit embarrassed by it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But anyway, you've mentioned before and everybody whose
                        dealt with the Voice of America says it's like dealing with a United Nations
                        and all the animosities are just intensified between different
                        nationalities, between different groups, politically, you know. Did this hit
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I was used to that because I had been on the USSR division before and even
                    among the Russians, the Russians are depending on when they emigrated and
                    whether they were Jewish or not Jewish. They had huge fights going on so it
                    didn't particularly concern me. There were some commentators who were from the
                    right wing fringes. One worked for the English language division that would
                    occasionally do things that were out of line. There wasn't a lot you could do
                    about that. They had their own supporters in the right wing press in the U.S.
                    and whenever you tried to rein them in you'd have something come out of the
                    other side where they would go to their sponsors and say something. Of course,
                    being from the State Department made you suspect in and of itself.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: And trying to shape the news to fit American foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved with putting at this stage of the
                        game, technology was changing. Did you get involved in almost the theology
                        of short wave versus satellite?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, there were two new developments. One of them was to use medium wave
                    and FM by feeding our material to local stations, which would then carry them.
                    When we put such a thing into effect in Europe, which I had my serious doubts
                    about because in order to appeal to the age group that you wanted to appeal to
                    on FM or medium wave, you had to make it mostly a disc jockey show. We would put
                    a lot of effort into this and it didn't really pay off, but it was popular in
                    Congress. Then of course, this was the period of WorldNet. That was television
                    and I don't think a terribly successful thing, but this was Wick's big issue and
                    what we did was to piggyback our radio signal on the WorldNet satellites so you
                    could pick off a radio signal and local stations could get the right to pick up
                    what we had and use it. We were at the same time building these new short wave
                    systems, but the listenership to short wave was declining.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, what about say with China, did China pose any
                        particular,really more political problems as far as what we would broadcast
                        to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, of course, there was a strong push for Radio Free China. One of our
                    long time rivals was Radio Free Europe, so whenever there would be an issue with
                    a country coming up, the idea would be to start a new radio free something or
                    other. Well, we've seen it again with Afghanistan. People have again come up
                    with this. That was always a debate going on, whether we should build more of
                    these “free radios,” but the more you slanted the news, the less credible to
                    become Radio Free Europe, which was a surrogate radio station that pretended to
                    be a station that came from within. It was reporting on local news where you
                    don't have a lot of sources to go on so if you're speaking only to the dissident
                    community you lose a lot of other listenership in your preaching to the
                    converted. We were always advocates of trying to make sure we had balanced
                    coverage and not coverage of just one aspect of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way Wick had his idiosyncrasies and all, people in
                        USIA kinof look back at a certain fondness with him because he got
                        money.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Oh, yes, he was very close to the president, but a lot othat money went to
                    WorldNet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: WorldNet being, could you explain what WorldNet is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: It was a worldwide television broadcast and the television was fed by
                    satellite to local television stations around the world who could pick off what
                    they wanted from the satellite and replay it on their own television stations.
                    So, a lot of the content was press conferences, speeches by prominent public
                    figures and things like that. It would be broadcast from studios in Washington,
                    it would be sent by television and picked up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not terribly interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Not terribly, no, it all depended on the willingness of othestations to
                    use the material.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you did this really for about two and a half
                        years?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>BARRY: About two years I guess. Then the Bush administration came in and as usual
                    there was a full-scale changeover in the State Department. So, I went to see the
                    new undersecretary for management Ivan Selin. I said, “Look I've been over there
                    at VOA for two years. I don't want to spend the rest of my life there. I don't
                    know anybody now in the hierarchy in the State Department. I think I could be of
                    some use. What I would really like to do eventually is go to Moscow, as
                    ambassador, but you know, in the meantime, could you find something for me?” So,
                    he gave me a special project, which was to change the way in which we processed
                    refugees from the USSR. That was at the time when they were allowing large scale
                    Jewish emigration and most of these people, although they might have applied for
                    an exit visa to go to Israel, really wanted to go to the U.S. We had moved a
                    very large number of the several tens of thousands of them to a place in Italy
                    where they were held while INS went through its endless process of trying to
                    figure out who was eligible, who could come in and Selin said, “Well, we've got
                    to stop that. It's costing too much. We need to process them in Moscow.” The
                    embassy in Moscow didn't think this was feasible. The immigration service was
                    certainly against it, but I was given this, perhaps because of my success with
                    TV Marti, as a project and spent the next several months trying to do this. That
                    was the time that the embassy in Moscow had this fire and it was being rebuilt;
                    we structured the embassy so that we had this huge area where you could
                    interview several dozens of people at the same time. We found a lot of people
                    who were retired Foreign Service people who went back there and took on these
                    interviewing jobs. We hired an outside contractor to do all this and eventually
                    it worked. I remember once overhearing a discussion between some people from the
                    Bureau of Consular Affairs and INS saying this was absolute nonsense, it will
                    never, never work. Selin was also a determined kind of person. Of course, the
                    OMB and everybody else was for it because it was going to save us a lot of
                    money. As I say, eventually it worked. We got through a backlog of people we
                    didn't have to send them to Italy anymore. It required some negotiation with the
                    Soviets about the extension of these peoples' exit visas because it sometimes
                    couldn't be done over the period of two or three months that they usually give
                    you exit visas for.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>Then in 1990 I had just been given the job of chief negotiator for the Open Skies
                    Treaty. In the meantime, the wall had come down and the Congress had put
                    together, a big package of aid for Eastern European democracies, the SEED Act,
                    which involved several hundred million dollars of assistance each year. Larry
                    Eagleburger was Deputy Secretary at that point. I had written a memo to Ivan
                    Selin saying, “You can't handle this money through this traditional AID
                    bureaucracy. They've never done this kind of thing. You need to have a dedicated
                    office working on this project.” Eagleburger was the coordinator of the whole
                    thing along with the deputy secretary of the treasury and the chairman of the
                    council of economic advisors. Selin passed my memo on to Eagleburger who bought
                    off on it and made me the head of the Office of Eastern European Assistance
                    reporting to the deputy secretary. We organized that. We got a bunch of talented
                    people, many of them quite junior, but also some colleagues from before who'd
                    been on the delegation in Stockholm and we set up this office. The first thing
                    we did was say to AID, look you've got this idea that you're going to send
                    retired AID employees to make a needs assessment in Eastern Europe. What are
                    they going to do? They're going to go to the U.S. embassy and say, “Well, what
                    do you think they need here.” It's going to take you almost a year and in the
                    meantime Congress is going to say, “Where is the money going?”, so “Why don't
                    you just drop that whole thing? Cut out the middle man, don't hire the retired
                    AID employees and we can tell you what they need because we'll go directly to
                    the embassies and to the governments concerned and come up with projects for you
                    to spend the money on.” I mean, they didn't like it, but Eagleburger was quite
                    capable of stiffing the director of AID and the person who was the assistant
                    administrator Carol Adleman, Ken Adleman's wife, was quite prepared to go along
                    with this. She saw that that was where it made sense to do this. So, we set up a
                    lot of programs. We had some new ideas, such as these Enterprise Funds, which
                    took some of the money appropriated by Congress and created a revolving
                    investment fund. We brought together a bunch of people from the private sector
                    to manage that and they were supposed to invest in small or medium sized
                    businesses that needed to be privatized. Some of these were a big success. The
                    Polish American Fund was a great success. Others were failures because of the
                    quality of the management that went into it. But we resisted the idea that there
                    would be AID missions in each of these countries. We said this is
                    bureaucratizing the whole process. Let's find some new ways of delivering
                    assistance and of course, this was a huge pot of money. I think at that point it
                    was $500 million and so everybody from around town was coming to want a piece of
                    it. Some of it was spent quite well; things like the National Endowment for
                    Democracy, NDI, the Republican Institute. They all put good programs in these
                    countries. We sent a lot of people from the business community out there to work
                    in newly privatized firms to try to improve management. We set up some legal
                    reform things, the American Bar Association projects. There was a lot of
                    business interest in going out there to do some of these things, but there was a
                    plethora of consultants hanging around.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, I mean there is a, I won't even call
                        it a cottage industry, it's a manor industry, I mean, all these big
                        universities have got grad students and professors they want to send out to
                        consult on various projects which is great for the graduate programs and
                        universities using American AID money, but not much gets translated. Were
                        you having to fight that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I don't think we did any of that then. There were lots of people who
                    wanted to do it. I don't think we funded any of that kind of thing. All I know
                    was that they were talking about the Marriott Brigade in Poland for example,
                    because the Marriott Hotel in Poland was full of consultants of one kind or
                    another, investment bankers and things like that who were coming over hoping for
                    some kind of restructuring process that would work. Later on of course, after
                    the breakup of the Soviet Union in '91, the Russian project came in there, too.
                    For a while it was under me as well. One of the things that we set up was the
                    Eurasia Foundation, which was modeled on the Asia Foundation. We took a chunk of
                    the money that was appropriated and gave it to this new foundation to provide a
                    quick response program so that if there are projects worth doing, it doesn't
                    have to go through the very slow cycle of planning that you do with AID. That
                    turned out to be a very successful thing. It's probably had the best reputation
                    of any of the things that we've been involved in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You keep mentioning having to bypass AID. Was it your
                        feelinthat AID had become too much of a bureaucratic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, in the first place it never worked in transitional economies. They
                    all were people who had experience in AID work, people who worked in Latin
                    American, or Africa, or Asia, or developing countries. It's a different set of
                    problems. The initial response had been well, we'll get our people who know the
                    AID business to go out and do assessments of what was needed in say Poland and
                    our answer to that was no this was a different set of problems. Also, their
                    cycle is a slow one. I mean they have to have a program design. The design has
                    got to be approved in Washington. The design has got to be looked at by the
                    appropriations committees and finally there has to be congressional
                    notification. All of that cycle takes about a year. We couldn't wait that long.
                    We would have been faced with vast criticism that the Congress had made this
                    money available and we couldn't spend it. Eventually, they got with the program,
                    but they didn't like it because it was clear that what we were doing was trying
                    to take as much of the decision making power as we could out of their hands and
                    put it into the hands of people who we thought could act faster and the other
                    they didn't like at all. They didn't like the Eurasia Foundation.</p>

                    things like the enterprise funds. We also had to spend time with the new

                    spent a lot of time in particular with the Czechoslovakian government; Polish
                    government, Hungarian government and we kicked off this whole thing with a White

                        impression of going down through this, let's talk about the Eastern European
                        thing, how about the Polish government? Did you find it pretty
                        responsive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, particularly the finance minister, Balcerowicz, who was a great
                    advocate of shock therapy which didn't work in the short run, but did work in
                    the long run.</p>

                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, the idea that you have to introduce reforms across the board and as
                    quickly as possible. As an example of doing things the other way, the Polish
                    finance minister often cited, if you want to change from driving on the left
                    hand side to driving on the right hand side, you don't do it one street at a
                    time, you've got to do it all at once. So, the decontrol of prices, the opening
                    up of stock exchanges, the privatization and so forth all was supposed to fall
                    into place in one fell swoop and of course, that created a lot of dislocation in
                    the short run. The Czech Prime Minister, Vaclav Klaus, was a big advocate of
                    this. One of the issues of this was how do you do privatization? Do you do it by
                    having investment banks come in and examine the firm and redesign it and then
                    sell it to domestic or foreign investors? That's a very expensive and slow
                    system and Klaus and the Poles as well came up with voucher privatization where
                    they create a set of vouchers representing the value of the state owned
                    enterprises. Those vouchers are given to the population and then they traded the
                    vouchers depending upon their value and the new management comes in and things
                    like that. It's still under dispute as to whether that was the right way to
                    approach these things. It worked pretty well in Poland. They didn't do it in
                    countries like Hungary. Each of the countries chose their own way dealing with
                    privatizing state enterprises. Many of these enterprises were defense industry
                    enterprises. How to convert defense industry that was an issue that we tried to
                    come to terms with. I remember going to a place in Estonia that had created
                    containment vessels for nuclear reactors for submarines and they were proudly
                    showing us what they were doing to convert this to civilian use. They had this
                    huge room full of machine tools that was probably five stories high that was
                    designed to produce these containment vessels with a tolerance of a couple of
                    microns and they were using it to create vats for fermenting beer-probably not
                    the most economical use of that machinery. The treasury department played an
                    important role when it came to macro economic policy and work with the IMF and
                    the World Bank and the U.S. executive directors and so forth. John Robson, the
                    Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, was an active player in all this.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Differently. I mean the Estonians were probably the quickest to do
                    economic reform and of course the Nordic played a big role in working with them.
                    Latvia was probably the slowest and of course the issue that took too much of
                    their attention was dealing with the Russian population in trying to assure that
                    the Russian population would be treated somehow civilly.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>BARRY: Hungary had been moving along the path of reform already, so they were
                    probably the most progressive of that bunch. We put a lot of effort in Hungary
                    into working with the Hungarian parliament to encourage investing. We helped
                    General Electric to buy a light bulb plant in Hungary, which turned out to be a
                    big success. There was some discussion of putting automobile assembly plants in
                    Poland. I think General Motors did that. So, we did a lot of work also with U.S.
                    companies who were interested in investing there. We spent a lot of time, well
                    Romania was the least reform-oriented let's see, Ceausescu was killed in
                    '89.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '89, December of '89.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: So, the country was a mess after that. Still is for that matter. We put a
                    lot of effort in Yugoslavia. This was the period when Markovich was Prime
                    Minister. He was trying to put together his economic reform package, which
                    recommended itself to the IMF and the World Bank. We traveled there a couple of
                    times. Of course, there was a lot of resistance to privatization and that I
                    think was the real key to the breakup of Yugoslavia. It was not nationalism per
                    se. It was the reluctance of people like Milosevic and others to see the
                    commanding heights of the economy turned over to the private sector, which was
                    part of Markovich's program. So, although much was made of the issue of Kosovo
                    and Croatian nationalism and so forth, I think the basic motivating force was
                    they didn't want to lose this opportunity of controlling the economy. To this
                    day in places like Bosnia or Croatia or Serbia the right of the ruling party to
                    put its people on the managing boards of these companies is the most carefully
                    guarded right of all and there is little enthusiasm for any real steps in the
                    direction of privatization. In '91 we had put together a program, and we were
                    about to get funds from the World Bank, but it was too late. We went there,
                    Eagleburger and I and others. We called in all these people one by one. Tudjman
                    and Milosevic and everybody we could find and told them what the consequences
                    would be of the breakup of Yugoslavia. Of course, at the same time, the
                    Austrians, and to a degree, the Germans, were whispering in the ears of the
                    Slovenes and the Croats, saying, “All right, get out of Yugoslavia quickly as
                    you can.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you had in a way as we were looking at the economic
                        resultof the breakup of Yugoslavia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: We strongly supported Markovich. We thought he had the capability of
                    holding the country together because the economic decline of Yugoslavia had
                    already long since begun. But he did not have much of a political base. He had
                    neglected to build up a political support system. So, at that time the CIA had
                    already done its estimates. About the only time I'd ever known that the entire
                    U.S. intelligence community was united in predicting this disastrous outcome of
                    the breakup of Yugoslavia. Our pitch to Kuchan in particular was that your
                    pullout could trigger civil war.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kuchan being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: He was the head of the Slovenes in Slovenia and he was the most eager to
                    get out and the one who had been the most told by the Austrians and the Germans
                    that they would find a nice home in Europe if he got out of there. Our pitch to
                    them was don't even think about it without having made some agreement about
                    minorities particularly in Croatia because we know that Croatia will probably go
                    out the door and then you'll have the problem of the divisions within Croatia.
                    All of which of course, turned out to be absolutely true, but Kuchan in
                    particular was stubborn about this. I guess after we went there Baker went there
                    and made a sort of halfhearted attempt to try and talk them out of it. By that
                    time there was a lot of pressure from the Congress. There was a lot of pressure
                    from the Europeans and Baker sort of said, “Well, I wash my hands of the whole
                    thing.”Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>BARRY: Then we started relief flights into Sarajevo at the end of my time there.
                    It was the first at that point after the situation had blown up in Croatia when
                    we had several discussions with Izetbegovich who came to Washington and then
                    Bosnia decided to declare its independence. The last two holdouts were Macedonia
                    and Bosnia who rightly saw that their going down this path of independence was
                    going to create tremendous divisions within their countries. By 1992, the siege
                    of Sarajevo had begun and we began to fly the first relief flights in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the rest of Europe I mean you say you had had a
                        piecof the action when the Soviet Union broke up and you had the
                        stands?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: It initially came to our office and then it moved over to Rich Armitage
                    who took over. Armitage had been working on something to do with the Philippines
                    and he was looking for something else to do and the initial idea after the
                    division of the USSR was to ship in relief supplies. These were left over from
                    the Gulf War. There was a major effort to fly these MREs into all these
                    places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: MREs are meals, ready to eat? In our time we used to call
                        theK-Rations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Right. This was a very popular effort with Baker and Margaret Tutwiler so
                    this Soviet thing eventually ended up in Armitage's backyard. By that time, my
                    papers had already gone over to the White House as they wanted me to go to
                    Yugoslavia as ambassador. I wasn't terribly eager to do this, especially sicne I
                    had several times told Eagleburger you're really sure you want to send an
                    ambassador to Milosevic who is not going to be one of our favorite characters.
                    Eventually they decided not to and then Eagleburger said, “Well, here are a
                    bunch of countries that are going to need ambassadors. Pick one.” I picked
                    Indonesia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes. Well, Warren Zimmerman was the last ambassador therand it had been

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 14th of December, 2001. Bob, in the first place did yohave any
                    problems getting confirmed to Indonesia?</p>
                <p>BARRY: No, not at all. It was not a country that was very high on the
                    congressional screen at the time. In fact it still isn't despite all the things
                    that have happened because it's sort of over the horizon. There were obviously
                    some issues concerning Indonesia which the Congress had some interest in. Human
                    rights, East Timor, the issue of military training, but you know in many ways
                    Indonesia was kind of like Yugoslavia, that is the American relationship with
                    Indonesia was forged in the Vietnam period where we were concerned about the
                    growth of communism in Asia. So we had had a pretty good relationship going back
                    to the immediate post war era. We had trained their military; we had provided
                    lots of assistance to them. One of the reasons I picked Indonesia in fact was
                    because of ex-AID director for Indonesia was working with me on aid to Eastern
                    Europe and when he heard that Indonesia was a possibility he said that that
                    would be a very interesting place to go. As indeed it was. So, I guess to be
                    honest about it, the greatest resistance I had was not from the Congress, but
                    from the East Asia Bureau.</p>

                <p>BARRY: The summer of '95.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Did some Indonesian language training and so forth, but I also spent a lot
                    of time with the business community because I was in the process of remaking
                    myself for the third time. I had remade myself from an arms control Soviet
                    specialist into a transitional development assistance person and then the now
                    third remaking was to be a promoter of American business. We had lots of big
                    business interests there ranging from oil companies to mining companies and a
                    lot of power companies and that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were getting ready to go out did you sort of
                        without anybody telling you or did you mentally have your own list of agenda
                        in your portfolio when you went out there that you wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, having worked closely with Eagleburger, Eagleburger was very big on
                    promoting American business. I didn't have to be told that that should be my
                    central priority in Indonesia. Of course, the other things, questions like human
                    rights, trying to get military training, the IMET program going again and the
                    overall problem of trying to understand a very diverse huge country which I had
                    never known anything about before. In fact, when I first came home to tell Peggy
                    that we were going to Indonesia, I bought a book on the way home that told me
                    for the first time that Bali was in Indonesia which rather delighted Peggy.
                    Actually the first experience we had in Indonesia was a truly remarkable one
                    because we got to know various people who had a long acquaintance with Indonesia
                    and one of them called up one day and said oh you must go to the cremation. I
                    didn't understand what she was talking about, I thought she meant coronation,
                    but no, cremation. Indeed we did. It was the raja of Bali and they have
                    periodically ritual cremations for people who have died, not just one person,
                    but hundreds of people at a time. So, even before presenting my credentials, we
                    went off to Bali and went through this truly remarkable ceremony. Thousands and
                    thousands of people and they build these huge cremation towers.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pyres?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, not pyres. They are, well they are several stories high, depending
                    upon the dignity of the person being cremated. Each one of them is carried by a
                    thousand people because they are so huge. So, we went there and we went to the
                    palace of the raja, a very educated person who had been the foreign minister of
                    Indonesia back in the '50s and were welcomed into his family and we went through
                    a ceremonial dinner for 5,000 people and then all of these pyres were carried up
                    to a hill where they were burned. The raja invited me to the position of honor
                    sitting next to him where he smoked a big Monte Cristo cigar watching the pyre
                    go up; then all of the ashes were gathered together and taken down to the coast
                    where they were put in outrigger canoes and sent out into the sea where they
                    were scattered on the ocean. Going up the hills they had to zigzag because they
                    wanted to make sure that the spirits got confused and didn't find their way back
                    somehow. So, it was an amazing experience. That was my first lesson in the
                    diversity of Indonesia. Of course, the Balinese are Hindu, not Muslim. There is
                    a variety of Hinduism I had never quite experienced before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was sort of the position the governmental position
                        both just sort of as a government, Suharto I assume at the time, but also
                        what was that position and then what was the financial situation when you
                        got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, the Indoesian government was at that point rather annoyed with the
                    U.S. because we had cut off military training and had said a number of critical
                    things about them. This was still the Bush administration that just became more
                    pronounced during the presidential campaign. The relationship with the U.S. had
                    always been a close one particularly with U.S. business. In addition to Mobile's
                    big LNG operation and this mining operation, the copper mine in Irian Jaya and
                    another big oil operation in Sumatra. We just had a very active business
                    community, probably 10,000 American businessmen living there at the time. What
                    was the rest of the question?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I was just wondering, Suharto's role was firm, I
                        mean, awe saw it at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>BARRY: It was very authoritarian. There was no crack in the facade. There was an
                    opposition lead by Megawati Sukharoputri, the current president, but it had no
                    traction and periodically her headquarters were burned down or something like
                    that because the Suharto's forces were not allowing any opposition to take
                    place. I mean this was a period of prosperity for Indonesia and certainly the
                    positive part for Suharto period was although there was a lot of corruption and
                    businesses had to do some unpleasant things, it was quite profitable for
                    American businesses to be there, so the business community was happy with things
                    as they stood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any at that time because we're very close to
                        the time, it wasn't just Indonesia, but Thailand and other places, I mean,
                        there had been too many cozy loans, I mean the economy was not on firm
                        ground. I'm talking about throughout Asia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: That was later. In '92 none of that had appeared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, was anybody I mean your economic counselor was saying,
                        “Boy,we may have a problem here” or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: There were problems with the banking system as there always are in
                    countries like that, but the income was going up. Essentially a lot of the work
                    that was being done was for investment coming in businesses, which had migrated
                    south. In other words, you started out with having a lot of labor intensive
                    stuff done in Japan and then it moves to Thailand or Southeast Asia and then
                    labor becomes too expensive there and it moves south to Indonesia or China. A
                    lot of the controversy about Indonesia at that time was about outfits like Nike
                    and what they did for their workers, or were going to do for their workers and
                    controversy about then human rights. We did investigate some of those issues at
                    the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about what was the impression you gained both through
                        meetinand dealing with and your embassy with Suharto at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>BARRY: Suharto was a typical Javanese prince, that is his whole aura was, he
                    didn't say very much, it was hard to draw him out on any subject. You had to
                    deal with him through the foreign minister or his great prot�g�, B.J. Habibi,
                    who later became president. Habibi was treated by Suharto like a son. He was
                    unpopular with the military. There was no question that he was a charismatic
                    person and a modernizer in the sense that he set up an Islamic organization
                    which was a modernizing outfit called the Association of Muslim Intellectuals. A
                    lot of my dealings with Suharto were through Habibi and I would make a
                    suggestion about something they ought to do and he would go see Suharto and come
                    back and tell me the decision. Even though I did spend a number of times in
                    conversation with Suharto I seldom got anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, he wasn't in a way the man to see really, I mean, he
                        might bthe man to make his decisions, but you dealt with others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: The vice president was a former commander of the army, the minister of
                    defense when I got there was Benny Moerdani who had close ties with the U.S.,
                    but was strongly nationalist. The state secretary was the sort of path of
                    communications witSuharto himself and Habibi was then the minister of science
                    and technology. Those were the people to see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: It was a good embassy. Many of the people there were repeaters. One of the
                    things about Indonesia is it is sort of addictive. People who go there usually
                    come back again a second or a third time. My predecessor as ambassador had had
                    three assignments in Indonesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: John Monjo. He spoke fluent Indonesian. The DCM was on his second tour,
                    the political counselor was on his second tour, the defense attach� was on his
                    third tour and that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you have to spend a bit of time sort of
                        establishinyourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I did have to spend a lot of time traveling when I first got there.
                    One of the first trips I made was from one end of Indonesia to the other. I was
                    in Aceh first because it was the key place both in terms of the longstanding
                    separatist trends in Aceh, but it was also where we had a major oil company
                    interest. Then with Habibi on one of his airplanes I flew from Aceh all the way
                    to Irion Jaya. A distance of some 4,000 miles. We had an attach� aircraft there
                    we used that liberally to get around the country to get to know as many people
                    as possible and to take with the embassy with you on all those trips.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention Aceh, was there a rebellion going on at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: There has been a constant state of rebellion going on in Aceh since the
                    time of the Dutch. The Dutch lost more soldiers in Aceh than any other war the
                    Dutch ever fought. So, all of those centrifugal forces were present then, but
                    kept under control by Suharto.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our thinking, were we concerned that some of
                        these centrifugal forces might actually take place, in other words in
                        Sumatra or at least part of Sumatra might peel off or something or was
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I think it was a worry because of the example of Yugoslavia. When I
                    came there it was known to Indonesians that I had previously been destined to go
                    to Yugoslavia and so the press was saying oh well the Americans think we are
                    going the way of Yugoslavia, that's why they're sending this guy here. Of
                    course, later on we sent Bob Gelbard there after he had been the czar of the
                    Balkans and that sort of underlined that idea. It wasn't anything we
                    particularly wanted to see happen. We could foresee if there were such an event
                    that would take place, it would be very bloody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, we didn't see it, I mean when you look at Yugoslavia,
                        you know this is going to be a very destabilizing within that part of Europe
                        all over, at least that's the potential. Did we see if Indonesia fell apart,
                        this would cause problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, we certainly saw it that way, but the Australians saw it a lot more
                    clearly because if there were an event in that country ten times as large as
                    Yugoslavia, the nearest place for the refugees to end up would be Australia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, the concern was really more refugees?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, no, the concern was, I mean, we knew that it would be very bloody.
                    There would be lots of killing that would take place. You go back to 1965 the
                    “Year of Living Dangerously,” the word amok is the loan word that we have from
                    Bahasa Indonesia and you'd still go around to the villages and you'd find
                    somebody in a wooden cage in the middle of the village and the explanation was
                    this was somebody who had run amok. Once an Indonesia runs amok he reaches for
                    his machete and goes after the neighbors. As we saw and as we see now in places
                    like Mallaca.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about the business community. What did
                        thewant from the embassy and what could the embassy do for them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, concretely we could give them lots of advice, we could intervene on
                    their behalf with the key players to get permission for various things to be
                    done. For example, the idea of private electric power generation was just
                    getting started and there was an American company called Mission Energy that
                    wanted to build a very large combined cycle power plant. When it came to getting
                    permission to do that kind of thing there was potentially a lot of corruption
                    involved. There was potentially the idea that you had to get one of Suharto's
                    children involved in the thing so we were called on in that case to try to run
                    interference for them. This was GE who was ready to put some capital into this,
                    but they wanted some assurances that this was going to work out all right, so
                    Jack Welch came to Indonesia and asked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the CEO of General Electric?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: CEO of General Electric. He wanted my advice about whether he ought to go
                    ahead with this thing or not. This was the inception of Asia Pacific Economic
                    Cooperation, APEC and the first APEC summit had been held I think in Malaysia,
                    but the APEC summit was scheduled for Indonesia in 1993 and Clinton came to that
                    summit. We were active in trying to promote APEC and trying to insure that the
                    climate for business was improved and the corruption was kept under control and
                    so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did American business particularly at the top level
                        deal with the fact that Suharto's family, the sons and daughters were seen
                        to be involved in everything? I mean it was a form of, it was corruption, I
                        mean, but.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, they dealt with it very carefully because of the foreign corrupt
                    practices legislation. Take for example, Mission Energy, they would not allow
                    any Suharto relatives to get in on the deal, but their coal contract was with a
                    company which had Suharto's children's involvement in it. Probably they paid an
                    excessive price for the coal, but it was that kind of arm's length relationship.
                    One of the biggest interests was the Freeport Macmoran copper and gold mine in
                    Irion Jaya, truly remarkable thing. Irion Jaya is very mountainous and this
                    particular copper mine was about 3,500 meters. There was even a glacier there
                    almost on the equator. The CEO of Freeport Macmoran was sort of a remarkable
                    figure from Louisiana, best known for his Elvis interpretations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Elvis Presley, yes, deceased star, rock and roll
                        star.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Anyhow, he would periodically come out in his private 767 and distribute
                    liberal gifts around to everybody, but not of the kind that was sort of an
                    envelope full of money, but he was sort of skating along the edge of foreign
                    corrupt practices act I suspect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For one thing, we're talking about the foreign corrupt
                        practices act which we were the first to put this sort of thing in and it
                        was considered to make us operate at a considerable disadvantage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Oh, well, that's quite true, it did because none of our major competitors
                    were under the same kind of constraints. The OECD finally did put into place a
                    requirement that bribing be criminalized, but that was well after I left, so say
                    the French Total Oil Company or the Siemens which also had many interests in the
                    country, they were certainly actively into corruption.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, say the Indonesians and this probably worked in
                        other countries, sort of understand the rules we operated in, I'm talking
                        about at the bigger level and we were still getting contracts because we
                        could come up with a pretty good deal or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, I mean, when we told them several times that yes, you can get a deal
                    from Siemens, for example, and there will be some payback for you, but the deal
                    will be much more expensive because there is no free lunch. The money for the
                    bribes gets added onto the contract price. Also, I think for political reasons
                    the Indonesians felt it was desirable to have the Americans involved as much as

                <p>BARRY: I stayed away from them. I did know the son-in-law Prabowo who was a
                    general in the army and had been the commander in East Timor for some time and
                    we did run into some of the children at social occasions, but I never

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the East Timor situation? What was it when you
                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: There had been an outbreak of violence in East Timor occasioned by a visit
                    by an American ambassador a couple or three years before. Ambassadors had not
                    visited East Timor for the last couple of years before I arrived and I thought
                    it was important to get out there and see it for myself. I went there early in
                    my tour of duty and went back several times, three or four times. I traveled
                    around the country and got to know the bishop and some of the missionaries that
                    were working there. Of course I got to know the military commander both in East
                    Timor and in Denpasar because the regional military command was there in Bali.
                    Actually one of the things that I was proudest of during my tour of duty was the
                    project we got started in East Timor which had been under the Portuguese. They
                    had a lot of coffee plantations, but these coffee plantations had been
                    neglected. The army was in charge of the Timorese economy, that's how they
                    supplemented their income and they paid very little to the coffee growers for
                    coffee and then sold it on the world market for much higher prices. Somebody who
                    was a long term resident of Indonesia gave us the idea of organic coffee growing
                    because they hadn't had fertilizers because they were too poor and the kind of
                    coffee grown there was a high value coffee so in fact with some funding from AID
                    we got this thing started and it grew very fast. We bypassed the army for
                    marketing. Eventually Starbucks, for example, began to buy some of this
                    organically grown Timorese coffee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for the record, Starbucks being an American
                        coffeehouse chain, extensive coffeehouse chain.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>BARRY: Anyhow, several thousand people eventually got involved in this and I
                    understand that it is thriving today in independent East Timor. So, we were
                    looking around for things like that, projects that were going to generate income
                    for the Timorese and loosen the grip of the army on the economy out there. Also,
                    we were constantly on the backs of the army about excessive force being used in
                    trying to deal with the Timorese insurgency. The head of that insurgency Xanana
                    Gusmao was captured or surrendered to the Indonesian military in '94 I guess it
                    was and jailed. Eventually with a visiting congressman we went to see him in
                    prison to insure that he was being well treated. Of course, he is now the
                    president of East Timor. One of the highlights of my time there was just on the
                    eve of Clinton's arrival for the APEC summit when a whole bunch of Timorese
                    jumped over the fence of the embassy and set up camp on the embassy grounds. We
                    had to intervene quite vigorously to keep the army from trying to come into the
                    embassy grounds and haul these guys out. Eventually when Clinton came they were
                    still on embassy territory and they were demanding to meet with Clinton and talk
                    about East Timor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were East Timorese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes. Then after Clinton left we had the issue of trying to make sure that
                    they did not leave the embassy grounds and go directly to jail. Eventually, they
                    were allowed to leave and many of them went to Portugal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were we getting news? Did we get much news about what
                        wahappening in East Timor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, this was the age of the Internet so a lot of the information came
                    through the Timorese emigres, some of them from Australia and some from
                    Portugal. We had embassy people there quite often. The Australians had somebody
                    in residence there who worked on aid issues. Of course we had the largest
                    intelligence organization in the world there, the Catholic church and spent a
                    lot of time talking to the papal nuncio, who traveled back and forth fairly
                    often. Of course Bishop Belo was one of the leading pro-independence people in
                    East Timor and we had a lot of contacts with him. I knew the governor pretty
                    well and when the governor would come to Jakarta he would call on me and when I
                    went there I would talk to him. He had been educated under the Portuguese, the
                    first governor, and the second governor, and came from more proletarian class. I
                    guess he had been a truck driver before, but in time he became sort of a
                    confidant and would come to me despite what he had to say publicly about the
                    magnificent Indonesia rule and would talk about what needed to be done to give
                    them more running room.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were there, where did you see East Timor
                        going?Independence, war, sovereignty, get the army out, I mean what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I tried to persuade the Indonesians that it was much in their
                    interest to let East Timor go, that it was clearly a drain on the economy that
                    was damaging their reputation internationally and the foreign minister certainly
                    agreed with that and periodically would try to intervene with Suharto to try to
                    make that case to him, but the military felt very differently about it partly
                    because they were so much involved in the economy. The military budget of
                    Indonesia is about 30% of the cost of the military and so the military
                    commanders were required to make up the rest of their expenses from the local
                    economy. East Timor was a leading source of income. The army argued and Suharto
                    believed that once you let one province of Indonesia go, the rest of them were
                    going to want to break away, too. This goes back to the 1950s when the CIA was
                    involved with an operation in support of Mallacan independence and a federated
                    Indonesia. In fact, we got caught with a CIA person flying a bombing mission a
                    la the Bay of Pigs and that whole episode was still fresh in the minds of many.
                    Q: Which brings up a topic, how well do you feel you were served by your
                    station?</p>
                <p>BARRY: Quite fine. We didn't have any kind of major operation going on there. We
                    were involved in some intelligence collection, but there was no policy
                    difference of any kind. The defense attache was a very experienced person with
                    lots of ties. One of the most respected Americans in Indonesia had been a three
                    time defense attache named George Benson who had very, very close ties with all
                    of the military. He was at that point a retired colonel and he was involved in
                    advising oil companies and other businesses. He came all the time to see the
                    generals. He would come and talk to me and talk to John Hazeman who was the
                    defense attache then at my time. When it came time to try to get a message
                    across to the military it was often most effective to send our defense attache
                    over and say, “Look, now I'm on your side. I've been trying to get military
                    training restarted, I've been trying to improve ties with the defense
                    department, but you've got to understand that if you do this, the reaction is
                    going to be that” and I think that restraining the military, for example, from
                    trying to break into the embassy and seize the East Timorese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the training issue? You've mentioned this a
                        number otimes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, ever since 1948 we've been involved in a close relationship with the
                    Indonesian military. We were of course in 1946 or '47 leading advocates of
                    Indonesian independence from the Netherlands. Then because of the domino theory,
                    we were involved in the strengthening of the Indonesian military, sending them
                    equipment such as C-130s and training many of their officers here in both
                    military and political military issues. It was the so-called International
                    Military Education and Training, IMET. The year before I got there we had
                    canceled IMET because of the human rights issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The human rights issue being focused on East Timor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>BARRY: No, in general the military was involved in governments at the provincial
                    level and they were heavy handed, not only in East Timor, but also in Aceh and
                    Sumatra and anyplace where there was sort of rumbling of dissent, the military
                    often went in with excessive force. This caused a great deal of unhappiness
                    especially among outfits like Amnesty and in the congress there was a move to
                    cut this off and by the time I got there it had been cut off and there was a lot
                    of resentment on the Indonesian side. The U.S. military was unhappy about it,
                    too. Of course, that was the age of the CINCs and CINCPAC, commander-in-chief,
                    Pacific came frequently to Indonesia. The right of passage of U.S. war ships
                    through Indonesian waters was very important to us and of course we had our
                    special forces that came and trained in Indonesia and so trying to restart the
                    relationship was a priority of mine. One of my predecessors twice removed was
                    Paul Wolfowitz who was at that point Under Secretary of Defense in the Bush
                    administration and of course he had an active interest in this whole thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, while you were there in the '92 to '95 period were

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Partly. We got something called expanded IMET, which concentrated, on
                    training in human rights. So, they would come to a war college or something like
                    that, but they would take a curriculum that had a lot of international military
                    law and stuff like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see while you were there the Indonesian military

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Several of them did. The younger generation of people I think were
                    beginning to reform, but there was a category of people around Moerdani who had
                    been the previous head of the army who were very nationalist and they were very
                    afraid that any kind of loosening of the ties would end up in the disintegration
                    of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Australia? It was the other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, the Australians and the Japanese were the two other major countries
                    involved. Japan had, as you can imagine, very extensive investments and the
                    Japanese sent some of their most able diplomats there. Their ambassadors there
                    were top notch and likewise the Australians. Of course, they were all knit
                    together in APEC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would imagine that the Japanese would be
                        completely,almost completely focused on trade?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, of course they were interested in protecting their investments and
                    the Indonesians were heavily in debt to Japan so they wanted to make sure that
                    the debt service was taken care of. But, in order to do that they had to be
                    interested in the politics of the situation in order to make sure and there was
                    really no difference in outlook between say myself and the Japanese ambassadors
                    there about need of some kind of reform process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Australians, how did you see their role in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Australia unlike the United States recognized the incorporation of East
                    Timor into Indonesia back in '75 and so they were inclined to downplay the
                    Timorese issue although quite conscious of the fact that it was something that
                    might come an issue in the longer term. I don't think their outlook was much
                    different from our own.</p>

                        beforehand of the Clinton administration approach? Was there a different
                        one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, initially of course the issue of human rights was greater than it
                    had been, Clinton had said some things during the campaign about independence
                    for East Timor and things like that, but there was an interesting sidebar here
                    because when Clinton had been governor of Arkansas, one of the leading
                    Indonesian business banking families (I should say Indonesian Chinese because
                    they were like many of the rich people in Indonesia a Chinese family), the
                    Riadys had bought a bank in Little Rock and became quite close to Clinton. So,
                    James Riady went to the inauguration and I remember seeing a film clip of
                    himself with Clinton. He emerged as a channel to the Clinton White House which
                    later turned into a scandal because the Riadys contributed money to the
                    campaign. That was one of the things that was investigated during one of the
                    many investigations going on in the Clinton period. The Riadys, being Chinese,
                    were critical of a lot of the things that Suharto and the military did, but they
                    were critical quietly and they were in the meantime doing deals for example with
                    Wal-Mart to open a big retail outlet in Indonesia and building big housing
                    developments and things like that. I guess when Clinton was there for the summit
                    he had an unpublicized side meeting with the Riadys, went to their house and so
                    forth. It caused the Suharto government to treat the Riadys more leniently than
                    they might have otherwise.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, he did, but he was I think never quite pleased with his own role in
                    Indonesia. He had been on the trip that Ford made to Indonesia in 1975 and Henry
                    Kissinger had been on the same trip when Lord was Kissinger's executive
                    assistant. It was widely rumored, but never admitted, that in 1975 the
                    Indonesians had given Ford and Kissinger and Lord advance notice of their
                    intention to move into East Timor. They had gotten if not a green light at least
                    a yellow light. Now it has come out as some of the papers from that period have
                    been released that the response of Kissinger or Ford was, “Well, if you're going
                    to do it, do it quickly and get it over with.” Of course, subsequently, Lord and
                    his wife in particular had become major human rights activists and so the issue
                    of what had transpired then was a sensitive one and I think colored some of his
                    approach to Indonesia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: There weren't really any big geopolitical issues at the time that would
                    have required this. It was kind of as I would say off the beaten track in terms
                    of congress and things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Islamic fundamentalism. Was that a concern or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: No, not much. This is a very syncretic form of Islam. Much of Indonesia
                    has got Islam late, in its period of decline. Much of Islam came to Indonesia
                    from China, not from Saudi Arabia or places like that. One of my good friends at
                    the time was Abdurahman Wahid, who later became president of Indonesia. He was
                    the head of the largest Islamic organization. He was a graduate of the
                    University in Cairo and so forth, but a very moderate person. I remember once
                    that he and I were meeting with a bunch of Islamic youth and they were going on
                    about the terrible things in Israel and how awful the Jews were and he took out
                    after them in no uncertain terms and called them all stupid and said, “If you
                    people were half as creative and well educated as the people your age in Israel,
                    this country would be a lot better off.” There had been a period back in the
                    '50s when the Islamic political parties wanted to do things like bring in sharia
                    law, but that was stopped by both Sukarno and later Suharto. The military was a
                    very secular organization and was very cautious about political power of the
                    Islamic parties. In Aceh there was some movement in the direction of
                    fundamentalist Islam, but again it was suppressed by the military.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I remember in '65 when 500,000 of them were killed. Most people
                    think of overseas Chinese as being the rich businessmen and indeed among the
                    rich businessmen most of them were Chinese, but there are also poor Chinese and
                    you can go to any of the provinces around the country and find, the Chinese may
                    be involved in trade, but they certainly weren't doing well by it. They ran the
                    kiosks and things like that. So, there was a lot of resentment and periodically
                    when I was there, there was a big riot in Sumatra where the people went out and
                    burned the Chinese stores and houses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Chinese important politically, the rich Chinese
                        or dithey keep out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Only behind the scenes. They were important because they were closely tied
                    to the Suharto family and most of the things that were done with the Chinese was
                    in partnership with somebody in the Suharto clan, but they couldn't pretend to
                    any kind of public political position because it was too unpopular.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: It came up occasionally from one source or another, but you know, I had it
                    on good advice that even by a person who was primarily accused of this, Bob
                    Martens, that there was no truth to this. There are some people in the U.S. who
                    still held that view.</p>

                        while afterwards, Cornell was one of the major intellectual centers
                        regarding Indonesia and the United States, the university and usually cast a
                        very critical eye on what we were doing and all. Was the Cornell syndrome
                        still going or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, my Deputy Barbara Harvey was a product of Cornell. She had studied
                    at Cornell and later taught in Australia and she was somebody I particularly
                    selected as somebody who really knew her way around. She'd done a lot of
                    research on that period.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, no, by this time the graduates of Cornell had spread out around the
                    country I guess there was an important center at Northwestern. There were of
                    course the people in Indonesia, the technocrats, who were in charge of the
                    economy were known as the Berkeley mafia because they had studied at Berkeley
                    and the leading people of academics who came out were, yes, there were Cornell
                    people among them, but they were not predominant.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, they weren't clashing, they were in APEC together, but, well you
                    have to understand that Suharto he felt his role as the senior person of the
                    largest country in the region gave him the right to be the leader of Asan in
                    which he often clashed with Mahatir in particular.</p>

                    the period of confrontation between Malaysia and Indonesia, Mahatir was on the
                    verge of boycotting the APEC summit in Indonesia and there was a lot of
                    criticism flying back and forth between the two. As far as the Philippines were
                    concerned, there wasn't much going on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, we had withdrawn and that was one of the reasons why over flight and
                    naval port visits and so forth in Indonesia were important to the U.S. military.
                    We had some ships that used to come into Indonesian shipyards for repair, mostly
                    to keep the Indonesian shipyards busy. On one occasion we had a carrier in the
                    area so we flew a lot of the senior Indonesians to the carrier and they got to
                    watch our carrier flight operations and so forth. That kind of military to
                    military and political military contact was important.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Oh yes, that had been a consistent factor of our relationship with
                    Indonesia for 50 years and it occupied a huge piece of real estate and it was
                    very important to us to be able to use that for innocent passage at least.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: There was a period there soon after the Clinton administration when
                    Clinton had the idea of appointing the ex-governor of Hawaii to my job and they
                    had even asked for agreement from him and then it turned out to be politically
                    undoable because he had gotten into a big fuss with Jesse Helms before about
                    flying the Hawaiin flag above the American flag at the capital and there were
                    issues about the money and so forth. So, that all went away, but there was a
                    period when I thought my term of duty was going to be cut short.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's nothing more satisfying than being an ambassador

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, in the event one of my old colleagues and friends, Stape Roy was
                    ambassador in China at the time. He had been scheduled to go on to Thailand, but
                    as my tour of duty came to an end they decided to send him to Indonesia instead,
                    so it was a very amicable turnover.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, and by that time I had been career minister for something like 12
                    years so failing another appointment that I had to retire and so I did and got
                    involved in some business operations with Ivan Selin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who had been the former?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>BARRY: Under Secretary for Management and head of the Nuclear Regulatory
                    Commission, but he wanted to do some power projects in Indonesia and so I got
                    involved in that. I got involved in some consulting work and became a member of
                    the board of directors of an oil company, Union, Texas Petroleum and was sort of
                    going along happily involved in these things when I got a call in the end of '97
                    from Bob Gelbard who ended up being the ambassador to Indonesia saying, “How
                    would you like to take over the OSCE Mission in Sarajevo?” Well, my initial
                    reaction was, “Well, no I wouldn't thank you because I've got a lot of other
                    things I have to do and I'd have to give them up if I went off and did this.”
                    But eventually they found a way where I could maintain my directorship and so
                    forth and be on a personal services contract to go out and do the OSCE thing. I
                    was reluctant to do it because I didn't anticipate that Peggy would want to come
                    with me, but in the event she did. I was only asked to do it for six months
                    until we had the 1998 elections. So, I said all right I'll do it and when I got
                    out there I found it to be a fascinating job and the final analysis stayed there
                    for three and a half years. The OSCE of course, started out as the Conference on
                    Security and Cooperation in Europe, and produced the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.
                    My friend and mentor George Vest told me the other day that Kissinger kept
                    saying, “Well, what do you want to be involved in the CSCE thing for? It's just
                    a nuisance.” George always felt that it had a lot of potential for various
                    things and felt certainly justified by the role that OSCE has taken and put into
                    the field these very large field missions. My mission was the first large field
                    mission and of course, its role was specified in the Dayton Peace Agreement. The
                    UN had fallen into very bad odor at that time after the UNPROFOR mission in
                    Bosnia which failed to protect any so-called safe areas including Srebrenica so
                    they wanted to put another organization in there. So, a lot of the civilian
                    implementation was assigned to OSCE including the administration of elections,
                    the drafting of election regulations, the protection of human rights, military
                    restructuring and military verification and the effort to try to democratize
                    political parties. So, it was a mission when I arrived of about 1,000 people, 27
                    offices around the country, headquarters in Sarajevo, some 30 countries involved
                    in the staff of the mission; my deputy was German and the political director was
                    Russian. The heads of the regional offices were variously Italian, German and
                    French and so forth, so it was a very multinational operation. Each country
                    seconded its own personnel to this. The U.S. had the largest contingent. This
                    had been a huge dispute at the Dayton Agreement period because the U.S. and
                    France both wanted the job of head of mission this and finally it came to a
                    discussion between Clinton and Chirac that decided that the issue in favor of
                    the Americans, but then we did live with some resentment about that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Okay, today is the 8th of January, 2002. Bob could you tell me whayour job was
                    and how it was created?</p>
                <p>BARRY: The OSCE Mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina was created by the Dayton
                    Agreement and the Mission was launched in December of 1995. Bob Frowick was the
                    first head of the Mission and this was the first large overseas field mission
                    that OSCE ever put in place. You will recall that the UN was not in very good
                    odor at that time particularly because of the problems with UNPROFOR and so
                    these duties which had in other cases been assigned to the UN, were assigned to
                    OSCE by the Dayton negotiators. It was quite a large mission. We had about 250
                    internationals and about 750 nationals; we had 27 offices around the country,
                    headquarters in Sarajevo, regional centers in places like Banja Luka, Mostar,
                    and Brcko.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Pale?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>BARRY: No, Pale was a stone's throw from Sarajevo, so you could easily go up and
                    see Mr. Karadzic when you needed to, but Banja Luka was really what later became
                    the center of Republic of Srpska, the capital of it. The task assigned to OSCE
                    by the Dayton Agreement was first and foremost the conduct of elections and by
                    conduct I mean everything connected with elections. The regulations, employing
                    and training the people who ran the election, administering the election,
                    counting the votes, implementing the election afterwards and so forth. We also
                    had the responsibility of implementing human rights. We were responsible for
                    human rights institutions like the Ombudsmen. We had a quite large field staff
                    that dealt with getting people back their property, implementing property laws.
                    We had a democratization department, which was training people how to operate in
                    a democratic society, working with political parties. We had a section that
                    dealt with military stabilization, that is inspecting to make sure that the
                    requirements of the Dayton Agreement in terms of demilitarization were kept.
                    Later on that turned into an effort to reduce the size of the armed forces and
                    the expense of the armed forces. We had a department that dealt with
                    implementing the elections after they were carried out, that is trying to
                    enforce some power sharing. So, it was quite a large operation. The Swiss who
                    were then the OSCE chairman in office in 1996 provided a Swiss military support
                    unit that did logistics, provided an airplane and all in all it was a big
                    operation. The deputy was traditionally German, the head of the political
                    department was traditionally Russian, we had 30 nationalities represented on the
                    staff and I'm pleased to say we had quite a large representation of women- about
                    half of the senior staff were women and one thing that I put in place when I
                    arrived there was the process of converting international positions,
                    professional positions to national positions, that is to let Bosnians be in
                    positions that previously had been filled by internationals thereby taking
                    people like the drivers who also had law degrees and putting them in instead as
                    national lawyers and so forth. So, that was the institutional arrangement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, just to get a clip, had the UN, did the UN have any
                        morrole there or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: The UN was assigned one role in Bosnia and that was international civilian
                    policing. There is a UN mission there, but the role was limited to training and
                    patrolling with the police. The police were a real problem institution, still
                    are today I might add, but that was the role of the UN. The senior civilian
                    representative was the high representative. This was a post created by the
                    Dayton Agreement also. He was given coordinating responsibility. The first high
                    representative was the ex-Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt and that turned into
                    a large office with ever increasing powers as civil implementation lagged behind
                    the military implementation. The military force was there by the time I got
                    there had been reduced from 60,000 to some 30,000 and it was called SFOR, the
                    stabilization force, traditionally headed by an American four star now a three
                    star general and their task was to enforce the local military provisions of
                    Dayton which was not very difficult to do because the military was
                    exhausted.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>BARRY: The Serb military and the Bosnian military. Under Dayton they were divided
                    into two armed forces, two entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
                    predominantly Muslim, but also the Croat minority and Republika Srpska (RS).
                    Serb entity, which pretended to full sovereignty, although this was not provided
                    for in Dayton. There was always a struggle between the central authority and the
                    council of ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the entities, particularly
                    with the RS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, could you comment a bit on the name which
                        struck me right from the beginning which really shouldn't have happened.
                        They called it something like the Republic of Serbska in the middle of
                        something because it sounds like it gives it much more of an identity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, that was in fact a big problem of the original Dayton Agreement.
                    This was however what emerged with the bargaining with Milosevic. Indeed the RS
                    has a constitution, which provides for sovereignty of the country. It had what
                    pretended to be a foreign minister. It tried to carry out its own relationships
                    as an independent state with others and that was a constant struggle between the
                    central authority, the international civilian administrators and the NATO
                    military to try to keep that in place. In fact, when I arrived there, the day I
                    arrived there, was a good example of that because we had been trying to
                    implement election results in Srebrenica. You will recall this is the place
                    where the great slaughter of Muslim men in particular took place, some 7,000
                    were killed. People were allowed to vote where they were before the war. Now
                    Srebrenica had been a majority Muslim area, but of course after the war and
                    after the ethnic cleansing, it was now almost entirely Serb. In the election of
                    1997 which was a municipal election, the Muslim refugees had come out in large
                    numbers and had voted heavily for Muslim candidates so the election result
                    dictated that the Srebrenica government would be 80% Muslim. Now there was a
                    huge struggle in trying to implement this because the Serbs would not allow the
                    Muslim councilors or anybody else back into the town so on the day before I had
                    arrived my deputy was at that point the acting head of the OSCE Mission had
                    tried to go to Srebrenica.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>BARRY: His name was Richard Ellerkman. He was a German and he had driven there in
                    a convoy protected by the military and but then there had been a big
                    demonstration to prevent them from entering the town. They had attempted to pull
                    him out of his armored car. Who knows what would have happened afterwards? There
                    was a helicopter that was accompanying the convoy that crashed because of the
                    weather. Anyhow it was a very nasty incident. That was just on the day I had
                    arrived there so from that point onward one of the key tasks was to try to push
                    the government of the RS into line. There had been an extraordinary election for
                    the RS parliament that had been held in November of 1997 and as a result of that
                    and then as a result of a vote in the new RS parliament which the international
                    community had certainly attempted to influence. Mrs. Plavsic, a Serb woman was
                    elected president of RS and she opted for cooperation with the international
                    community, leaving the SDS and forming her own political party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The SDS being what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: This is the Serb Democratic Union, the party of Radovan Karadzic, the
                    people who were the main aggressors of the war. Karadzic himself was in hiding
                    at that point. He was and still is sought by the international community because
                    he was indicted by the international criminal tribunal for the former
                    Yugoslavia, the UN organization set up to try people for war crimes. But he
                    still had a heavy influence on the party exercised through the Serb members of
                    the tripartite presidency, one Serb, one Croat, one Bosniac. The Serb was
                    Krajisnik, now in the Hague, where he still awaits trial together with Plavsic
                    who was indicted later. They were all in Pale at that time although when Plavsic
                    took over as president she moved the capital of the RS from Pale on the
                    outskirts of Sarajevo to Banja Luka which helped to civilize or urbanize the
                    Serb politicians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sort of get a feeling as I did from just reading
                        accounts of the war that it was a little bit, the war with the Serbs a
                        little bit like the hillbillies versus the flatlanders and Pale being sort
                        of the hillbilly capital?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, that's certainly true. In addition the people who came and who were
                    its worst participants in the war were not from Bosnia at all. These were gangs
                    of paramilitaries from Serbia itself who were involved in ethnic cleansing and
                    some of the worst atrocities of the war. These were people who had fought in the
                    early stages of the war in places like Vukovar to drive the Croats out of Serb
                    areas in Croatia. People like Arkan and that crowd, were the worst participants.
                    Serbs had had a large population in Sarajevo in fact the leaders of the parties
                    were not hillbillies at all. Karadzic was a professor of psychiatry from
                    Sarajevo University, Plavsic was a professor of biology from Sarajevo
                    University. Many of the leaders on all three sides were university professors.
                    Being a professor or a doctor of something gets you further in politics in the
                    former Yugoslavia than it does in most other countries in the world.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, in the first place, what did the
                        State Department or government or anybody tell you before you took over this
                        job. I mean, here you're taking the president's shilling in a way, I mean at
                        least to begin with. Somebody is saying, “Bob we want you to go out and make
                        sure this happens” or do this or that or did you get much instruction? Were
                        you sort of tossed into it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I spent some time in Washington before going out, not very long in fact,
                    only about two or three weeks because I agreed to take the job on the 15th of
                    December and I left on the 8th of January as it was necessary to get somebody
                    out there right away. But I spent some of that time with Bob Gelbard who was
                    then the sort of Balkan czar and his office of Balkan implementation. This was
                    an organization set up in 1995 to be directly responsible to the secretary
                    outside the bureau of European affairs. It was Gelbard who recruited me for this
                    thing. The main task was to prepare for and hold the first set of countrywide
                    elections which were set for November of 1998 and so I was sent there with the
                    idea that I would conduct these elections and that would be it since I did not
                    want to commit myself for a longer period. But of course, I knew something about
                    the country to begin with. I read into the intelligence material and about what
                    was going on. A central task that we saw for ourselves was taming the
                    nationalists and this was an uphill struggle. We made a serious mistake in 1995
                    by thinking that early elections were going to solve the problem and be the exit
                    strategy for the military. In fact, early elections of course simply confirmed
                    the legitimacy of the nationalist parties who had led the country through the
                    war. The three nationalist parties were the Croatian National Union, the HDZ
                    which was made up largely of Croat nationalists under the protection of Tudjman
                    in Croatia, the SDS led by Krajisnik but under the sponsorship of Milosevic in
                    Belgrade and the SDA led by Izetbegovic, arguably the victim during the war, but
                    also, a strongly nationalist devout believer in Islam who really wanted to
                    create a state under Bosniac that is Bosnian Muslim dominance. These three
                    parties were the victors; all of the elections that we held except for the last
                    election in 2000 where finally we did manage to break the monopoly of the
                    nationalist parties. But all elections were marked by an effort to stir up
                    racial ethnic distrust because that was the way of driving the people back to
                    their political base. So, the election campaign periods were marked by the use
                    of hate language and worse sometimes- assassinations of people campaigning for
                    the wrong party and corruption and things like that and so that was part of our
                    task to control that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that most of us in the Foreign Service
                        or in government really never think about are elections. I mean elections
                        are kind of held and yet there is a major infrastructure in any country that
                        have had these things of people who know how to do it. I mean, when you
                        arrived there, what sort of cadre did you have to put together
                        elections?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>BARRY: We had had two elections before I arrived, three actually, so it was under
                    my predecessor Bob Frowick that we built this up. In the first place we created
                    an election commission responsible for organizing all aspects of the election.
                    It was made up of both nationals and internationals. As head of the OSCE Mission
                    I was the chairman of that commission and the rules dictated that if the
                    chairman decided differently than all the other members of the commission, the
                    chairman's word carried. So, we had representatives of the three national groups
                    represented on the commission. When I came I expanded the commission to bring in
                    independent figures from the Bosnian community who were noted for being
                    anti-nationalist. The best known of them probably was Zlatko Dizdarevics who
                    wrote books about the war he was a correspondent for the newspaper,
                    Oslobozhdenija. We altered the balance of that commission. But in on the field
                    on election day it takes about 35,000 people to run an election. The people who
                    sit in the polling places were organized by our various field offices. We tried
                    to find people who had had previous experience in elections, but as you know
                    Yugoslav elections were noted for 99% pro-Tito votes so we had to find people
                    who were prepared to look at this as an exercise in building democracy. The
                    incentive was that we paid them well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was one of the 30,000 for the I guess the '97 vote.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, these were the international supervisors. I'm talking about the
                    35,000 Bosnians who ran the polling stations. Whenever we had these elections in
                    the early days we brought in international supervisors in every polling station
                    and that amounted to about 2,500 people. In later days those numbers were
                    reduced, but the international supervisors were theoretically in charge. They
                    could overturn a decision by the local polling station committee if required and
                    they were responsible for making sure that all the rules were observed, as they
                    should have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were going on this, did you, was there sort of a
                        feeling on the American side was this different from other ones, that
                        somehow if you get people to vote, you know, democracy, then all of a sudden
                        good things would happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, that was certainly the view in '95, but we learned that this
                    wouldn't necessarily happen because the bad guys were voted into office and they
                    remained bad guys. At the point that I arrived we recognized that our task was
                    to try to organize the nationalists out of office. That meant changing the rules
                    under which the elections were held. We had to draft an election law. In fact
                    the idea originally had been that that law would be drafted by the Bosnians
                    themselves, but no progress was made on that. One of the things that we worked
                    on was trying to put into the election law reform elements that would favor the
                    parties that were democratic. Most parties believed in the principle of
                    democratic centralism, as all of these parties were left over from the days of
                    Tito.</p>

                <p>BARRY: So, as we were organizing the elections we were also trying to produce
                    elements of reform. For example, we required by fiat that one-third of all
                    candidates for political office had to be women. Not a natural tendency among
                    Balkan political parties, but we insisted that any party that did not produce
                    one third female its candidates would not be allowed to run in the election. We
                    also had the power to dismiss candidates, forbid them from running for office,
                    to remove people after they were elected for noncompliance with rules and
                    regulations which we didn't use too often, but when it came to some of the worst
                    nationalists who were using hate language and things like that we did not
                    hesitate to remove them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find as you were doing this, I mean somehow I
                        think in this field the term often for Americans when we start getting
                        involved in these things is well, “How naive you are” and Europeans tend to
                        feel they are much more sophisticated. Sometimes I question this, but did
                        you run across this sort of attitude among your international staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I don't think so. I think the international staff was rather idealistic to
                    start with or they wouldn't have been there. The people who came, initially were
                    seconded to the OSCE by foreign ministries. But by the time I got there most of
                    those people had gone and the people who were coming were people who'd been in
                    non-governmental organizations before. Many of them had been election
                    supervisors who liked what they were doing and wanted to stay. The Americans in
                    the mission were obviously a minority. Of the senior staff of about 30, only
                    about seven or eight were Americans. The Europeans were motivated by something
                    very important. They wanted to do something for the Bosnians, but they wanted to
                    do something for the Bosnians in Bosnia and not have them become refugees and
                    come to Norway or Sweden or Germany or wherever. So, the idea that you could
                    produce a real working political and economic body there that would create or
                    allow economic development to take place, allow the 40% unemployment rate to be
                    reduced to give people a sense that there was a future in this country was a
                    motivating force for the people there. A lot of the people were young. We called
                    them Danube groupies at first. But they were also highly motivated. They were
                    not jaded, foreign office types.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. They'd seen it all and you know, which is I think one
                        of the problems often we have come with a little fresher look. It may be
                        naive, but it's fresher than, but you weren't suffering from that over
                        sophistication?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>BARRY: Oh, I don't think so. We believed it could be done or else people like
                    myself wouldn't have spent three and a half years there. I'm not sure how much
                    it was done, it certainly ended up better as I left as I left than it did when I
                    arrived. There still remains a lot to be done. I think the worst problem was the
                    lack of any feeling about what a market economy was about. The initial breakup
                    of Yugoslavia was not about nationalism, it was about the economy. Markovich was
                    trying to reform the economy, trying to get rid of the idea of social ownership,
                    trying to privatize and that was a challenge to all of the local satraps,
                    resisted very strongly especially by Milosevic and Tudjman. They used the
                    rallying cry of nationalism, but the purpose was to maintain control over the
                    commanding heights of the economy, as the communists used to call it. That
                    stayed in peoples' minds after the war no matter how much lip service was paid
                    to the idea of private ownership and market economy and so forth. Political
                    party leaders were mainly interested not in being elected to office, but being
                    on the managing boards of the state owned companies. Unfortunately I think it is
                    equally true of the opposition that later came into office, the social
                    democrats. Those were the things that were fought about most strongly and the
                    big cash cows, the state companies like the PTT or electric power generation
                    were also sources of large amounts of money for political parties. Wse fought
                    that throughout the period without a great deal of success. The World Bank and
                    the IMF were interested in macro economic stabilization. In that sense they
                    wanted to make sure that they set up a currency board, they tied the convertible
                    mark to the German mark and they did a good job with dealing with inflation and
                    making sure that the currency was sound, but they didn't succeed in breaking the
                    barriers to foreign direct investment and that meant that the unemployment rate
                    remained in the area of 40% throughout the whole time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you look at Bosnia and you see a thin line to the
                        coast, guess they had it, did they make the coast, I can't remember
                        now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, they did as they did before the war as well. Bosnia had had a small
                    strip of coast at Neum. Actually this goes back to the period of the Ottomans
                    and the Venetians because that piece of coast was designed to be a buffer zone
                    between Dubrovnik and the Ottoman Empire. But there was a rail line, which ended
                    up in Ploce which, was in Croatia and the other exit was on the Danube at Brcko.
                    But both the rail lines were cut off, first because the Croats were very
                    reluctant to allow access to Ploce and because Brcko was a problem area and the
                    Danube was all silted up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A number of questions here. One, there was this problem
                        that I recall reading about where it was found that an awful lot of the
                        money that went into enterprises there that was given by international funds
                        or loans or whatever it is ended up being siphoned off for corruption and
                        all that sort of thing. Was this a major problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>BARRY: That was a news item, but it was not accurate. Yes, there was and is a
                    great deal of corruption, but it was not money that had been channeled in by the
                    international community. The real corruption was in the revenues that came to
                    the government, whether through turnover tax or whether it was through
                    state-owned companies. A lot of that money was diverted for illegal purposes. Of
                    course there was a huge organized crime faction that operated there, smuggling
                    was a huge business and the evasion of customs duties, the payment of bribes to
                    people for favors done by the government was a real issue. The money that came
                    in was largely reconstruction money and like most international aid money it
                    didn't really flow to people in Bosnia at all, it flowed to companies in the
                    countries that provided the aid who came in and built the new housing. We tried
                    very hard to go after corruption. We in fact, the OSCE, developed a bill of
                    particulars against the Prime Minister of the federation, Mr. Bickacic who was
                    guilty of all kinds of fraudulent activities as Prime Minister. We presented
                    this in hopes that there would be a criminal prosecution. We finally had to
                    dismiss him because he was carrying these things on, the attitude of
                    Izetbogovic's political party was that this is a tradition that we have. He
                    wasn't doing it for himself, he was doing it for the good of the party. The old
                    story was that we in the Balkans never had our own state, so it was okay to
                    steal from the government. Now the government is us, but we haven't really
                    learned that so we're still stealing from the government, but we're stealing
                    from ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that, how did you deal with say the various
                        sections, I mean with Izetbegovic or with Pompavich or others, is it
                        Plavsic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Plavsic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And others. How did you deal with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>BARRY: Well, they were always compliant. In other words, you'd go to see them and
                    you'd say, “Look this is wrong, you've got to fix it” and they would always say,
                    “Yes,” but then they wouldn't do it. I remember my first interview with
                    Krajisnik, the Serb member of the presidency. Of course he would always begin
                    with this lecture about Serbian history. We got about ten minutes into this and
                    I said, “Wait a minute. Now I know about this because I did my dissertation at
                    the university on the empire of Stephan Dushan in the 14th century, so I might
                    know more about this than you do.” You would always go to see them and they
                    would say, yes, yes, yes, and then they would go on and do the same old thing.
                    Often the only way of affecting these things would be to punish them for their
                    activities by removing some of their candidates, as eventually hauling Krajisnik
                    off to the Hague. In those cases the party affected always presented themselves
                    as an injured party. Their constituents would generally support them. Some of
                    the things we did were quite successful in public relations terms. For example,
                    there's a huge problem of people living illegally in other peoples' houses
                    they'd occupied after the war. Many of these people were politicians so we
                    passed a rule saying if you're illegally in somebody else's house you can't hold
                    office, you can't run for office. That was generally very well received by the
                    public.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find Bob, that there was a new generation coming
                        along, not necessarily in age, but people beginning to look at things a
                        little differently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Oh there were, but they were leaving. UNDP took a poll and the poll
                    discovered that 60% of the people below 25 planned to leave the country. We
                    brought some people back, attracted them back for example to work for us because
                    we paid them more than domestic employers, but the young people were turned off
                    by politics and the job opportunities for graduates of Sarajevo University were
                    very slim indeed. There are some promising people on the horizon, but Sarajevo
                    itself is not the same kind of multicultural place that it once was. To get
                    anyplace in politics you have to make peace with the nationalists. I remember a
                    person I knew that had been in England during the war, had gotten a medical
                    degree and gone to work in a teaching hospital in England and came back and went
                    to the main hospital in Sarajevo to look for a job. The first question they
                    asked was what political party do you belong to. His answer was, “Well, I don't
                    belong to any.” They said, “Well, unless you want to join the SDA, Izetbegovic's
                    party, there is no job for you in this hospital or anyplace else in the medical
                    profession in Bosnia.” That was kind of a carryover from Tito's days when you
                    had to be a member of the communist party. Even then the medical profession and
                    judiciary were not as politicized as they are today.</p>

                        back in the '60s who would come back on the academic or medical side and
                        find it wasn't party as much as they hadn't, they didn't belong to the old
                        boys' club, I mean they had gone to some place out there like Harvard or
                        Yale and what the hell was this. They hadn't graduated from Belgrade U and
                        so they weren't going to get anywhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, cronyism is part of the issue and was certainly part othe issue in
                    the judiciary or police.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did foreign companies come in and start asking what are
                        the opportunities for going here? I'm talking about companies that could
                        come in and perhaps generate jobs and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, yes, and they did come and we encouraged them to come. I had an idea
                    when I first arrived there that you could bring software companies in and of
                    course there are a very large number of well-educated engineers in Bosnia. The
                    information technology people that we had were very good. They could do software
                    writing, but the whole atmosphere was anti-foreign investment. It took 16
                    separate authorizations for a foreigner to start a company and of course in each
                    place you had to pay somebody a bribe. One of the things that you had to get was
                    a certificate from the ministry of defense saying that the formation of this
                    company be it a bakery or whatever would not undermine the national defense of
                    Bosnia and Herzegovina. The attitude toward foreign investment was give us your
                    money, do not participate in management and we will take care of it for you and
                    provide you with some minimal return on that money. They would invite Japanese
                    industrialists to come and talk about investing and of course, when they heard
                    this sort of routine, they would laugh. Although Turkey of course was very eager
                    to support a Muslim entity in Europe. The Turkish ambassador finally said, “I'm
                    not inviting anymore people here to talk about investments because you people
                    are simply unreal about what you expect.” Of course, the old economy was already
                    decaying or decayed in 1991. Under Tito's regime, the Yugoslav economy subsisted
                    basically on the theory of nonalignment which meant let's say that Libya would
                    get a Yugoslav construction company to come there and do something, but then
                    they wouldn't pay them for it. Big industrial firms like Energoinvest had died
                    already on the vine and there was no hope of restoring them although the
                    government kept hoping they would. Peggy, my wife, was involved in small
                    business because she was working with a group that had been started by the
                    Norwegians called Bosnian Handicrafts which took refugee women and their
                    knitting and marketed these things largely to foreigners. But the tax collectors
                    came every week to make sure that all the taxes were paid. Nobody pays taxes
                    except for small business who don't have any alternative and banking
                    transactions were terrifically expensive. So, it was a real struggle.</p>

                        mean this sounds terribly discouraging I mean how did you and your staff get
                        yourself up to continue because you know if the economy doesn't work and if
                        you can get the unemployment below 40%, I mean really start to make the
                        economy work, if you can't get to that because of attitudes and other areas
                        like resources and all that. How did you gear yourself up to you know, just

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, the main responsibility for the economy was with the office of the
                    high representative. They were not terribly effective with everything that was
                    done. Clinton appointed a special ambassador initially to deal with trying to
                    straighten out the economy in Bosnia and Herzegovina, later he worked all around
                    the Balkans. He was quite effective.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Oh, I've forgotten his name. We pressed hard on privatization trying to
                    get the big cash cows privatized. The theory that had been developed was voucher
                    privatization. Not a very effective way of doing it. Of course it was fought all
                    the way along by political vested interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is voucher?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Because it had been social ownership before, workers got vouchers
                    whiccould be turned into stock. An individual private company could be sold on
                    the open market, but this was fought by the vested interests because they wanted
                    Russian style privatization whereby the assets of the company are stolen, the
                    company is reduced to a shell and it is then sold to its current managers for a
                    song and then the company is restored afterwards and the managers get rich. So,
                    we tried to fight that. We removed some of the people who had been in charge of
                    privatization. We passed a regulation saying that if you are on the managing
                    board of the state company, you can't hold political office. That created great
                    gnashing of teeth, but we got rid of several thousands of people who were both
                    elected officials and on managing boards. We preached the idea of private
                    enterprise to the opposition parties, the social democrats in particular. The
                    idea was that when they came to power they would truly change the way they dealt
                    with the economy. In the event they were pretty much like the rest of them, when
                    they did finally come to power.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, you had a Russian deputy. How did that work?
                        Wherwas he coming from?</hi>

                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>BARRY: Oh, I went through three of them I guess during my time there and they
                    were all very different. None of them were particularly trying to push the
                    Russian point of view. In fact the first one turned out to be a really excellent
                    political officer who knew what was going on in the country, but the Russians
                    wouldn't extend him I suppose because he wasn't giving them inside information.
                    He stayed on in his private capacity. Actually I got along well with all of
                    them. They were not very good managers. The sections that they presided over
                    generally let everybody do what whatever they want to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of managing and all this, I just finished an
                        interview with Bill Farrand, who was in Brcko. I never quite understood. He
                        explained it to me, but I never quite got the feeling. He seemed to be under
                        almost separate orders of some sort of amorphous European entity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, he was under the Office of the High Representative (OHR). The job of
                    the Brcko administrator was created at the Bonn summit of 1997, by the steering
                    board of the peace implementation council. The administrator of Brcko was under
                    the office of the high representative, but with very wide latitude as to what he
                    could do in Brcko. Bill and Gary Matthews who then followed him in that job and
                    Henry Clark who's there now were subject to some degree of guidance from OHR,
                    but basically this was an American enclave where the American military was
                    stationed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean did you get involved with that or was that
                        something sorof over the horizon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: We got involved in it in terms of elections and in terms of knowing it was
                    there, but it was not within the end of OSCE, the office of the high
                    representative. The principals of the international community were the commander
                    of SFOR, the American general, the high representative himself, who by the time
                    I got there was a former Spanish foreigminister and later became Petritsch, the
                    Austrian. The head of the UN mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina started out to be
                    a Finn, Elizabeth Rhen, then it became Jacques Kline, and American and the head
                    of OSCE. Plus, the representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. So
                    that was the international steering board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, again I feel for this community working, the
                        international community because as an observer I was on a main road, I can't
                        think of the name of the town now, but it was between Sarajevo and Tuzla. It
                        was a good size town and we kept getting visited by people wearing white
                        suits and military, I mean I've never seen so many observers. It was going
                        fine, there was no problem there, but my God we spent all of our time sort
                        of entertaining these people who came through. But anyway I was just saying
                        there were so many observers and this must have gotten in your way didn't it
                        in things or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>BARRY: At election time in particular, these people were out there to keep an eye
                    on whether there was any sign of violence or effort to interfere with people.
                    Yes, there were probably too many of practically everybody. When I first arrived
                    there I called for a streamlining of the international community so there was a
                    clear distinction of roles, an idea whose time was probably still not come
                    although they're talking now about ways of reducing the number of people
                    involved and making the responsibilities clearer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the elections? I mean the two
                        places I did one in a Muslim area and another one in outside of Dervantar,
                        which was essentially Serbian, and I was impressed. There was a certain
                        variety of votes. I mean it wasn't all just for one person, obviously Serbs
                        got the most in Serb areas and Muslims got it the most in others, but the
                        election itself seem to go fairly well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, I think they went well, the only trouble was the outcome. The idea
                    that you'd get people to vote for parties that supported the concept of
                    multiethnicity that is of sharing power with the other group in your town never
                    got very far. It went progressively further each time to the point where in the
                    last election in 2000 the parties were able to put together coalitions that
                    excluded all the nationalists, but the tendency was at election time to remember
                    all the bad things your Serb, Muslim or Croat neighbor had done wrong and try to
                    elect a strong figure who would be able to protect your national interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking about the nationalists, you have Karadzic and a
                        Mladec who was the general and both of these are indicted war criminals and
                        all. Did you get involved in trying to get them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: If the 30,000 or 60,000 strong military was not able to get them, I don't
                    think the unarmed OSCE was in a position to get them. We certainly tried to urge
                    the military to take a more active role in all of this. The trouble with the
                    SFOR or IFOR military command structure was that the control of the forces on
                    the ground still rested with the sending government, despite the fact that there
                    was a four star general in charge of this thing. He could tell the French to do
                    something and the French would turn back to Paris and the French would say,
                    “Well, screw you, we're not going to do it.” The areas where Mladic and Karadzic
                    were reported to be were under French control. Now I think Karadzic and Mladic
                    both went back and forth a lot. Mladic spent most of his time in Belgrade,
                    Karadzic slipped back and forth across the border with Montenegro, but the
                    military intelligence would deny that they knew where he was. That's because
                    they didn't want to know where he was. The marching orders were, well, if you
                    run into him somewhere all right, well, we'll take him, but he had a body guard,
                    150 people, heavily armed and SFOR was not particularly eager to do this. There
                    were various attempts that were made including the insertion of some U.S.
                    special forces with the task of doing this, but for one reason or another it
                    never came to pass.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>We insisted and finally it happened, but only recently, that the SDS the Serb
                    nationalist party, had to expel indicted war criminals from the party. We
                    threatened even to forbid the SDS from running unless they did this. Now finally
                    it's been done, but I don't really expect Karadzic to end up in The Hague any
                    time soon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of sort of the military side, I recall when I was
                        in Derventa that we were briefed by a British army captain who was quite
                        bitter about you Americans, talking to me about training the Bosnian army
                        and we wanted, his idea was don't train anybody and keep it disarmed and we
                        were. Could you explain about the issue of training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, this goes back to the idea of “lift and strike.” If you remember in
                    the early days of the Bosnian war the idea that came from the Democratic party
                    in the campaign of 1992 was that we should lift the arms embargo against the
                    Bosnians and use NATO air to strike the Serbs. After the war, the code word
                    became train and equip. This was heavily sponsored in the U.S. Congress. Before
                    the war, the Yugoslav army was essentially Serb, so the people who were
                    officers, the people who had military training, were Serbs and the army of the
                    Republika Srpska was closely tied to the JNA, the Yugoslav National Army. So,
                    the idea was you had to deal with this problem by training and equipping the
                    armed forces of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This all got started
                    in 1994 and '95 when a private company made up of retired U.S. military called
                    MPRI played a very heavy role in advising the Croatian military in their
                    offensive against the Serbs which ended up driving the Serbs out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a sort of CIA type sponsored private
                        company?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: No, it was not CIA sponsored, but it was funded by the U.S. Congress. It
                    was overt and not covert. But then after the war we continued that. I had my own
                    misgivings about it because I felt that this was creating an imbalance and was
                    also creating an armed force that was much too large for any legitimate purpose
                    other than going to war with each other again. But it still had a lot of support
                    in the U.S. The Brits and the rest of NATO generally didn't like the program,
                    but it was something that we stuck with and the Pentagon was keen on it and it
                    was a big money maker for the people involved. The Brits were the most competent
                    among the military there and they made a lot of fun of us about our force
                    protection requirements. All of our people went along in armed convoys, on
                    patrols and armored vehicles and so forth.</p>

                <p>BARRY: Their people of course having spent all this time in Northern Ireland were
                    pretty good of getting out among the people and talking to them. Ours have
                    progressed over the years, but it was still a much too heavy, armored force for
                    what was really required.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern about Islamic fundamentalists? You know
                        there were reports that a lot of these people were coming from Middle
                        Eastern countries during the war and then they settled in and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, there was concern about it. It was not a very large-scale phenomenon.
                    There were a number of mujahedeen who had come and formed a special unit in the
                    Bosnian army and these carried out a lot of activities not approved under the
                    laws of war. Some people have been indicted for it since. Some of these people
                    stayed and they lived in a former Serb village in the federation where they
                    really controlled the village. Some of these people were connected with al
                    Qaeda; one of them was arrested in Turkey carrying a Bosnian passport where he
                    was recruiting people to go fight in Chechnya. We insisted on several occasions
                    that these people had to leave. It was part of the Dayton Agreement. In fact,
                    Izetbegovic in particular was not at all eager to drive these people out. He
                    felt he owed them a debt of gratitude for working with them during the war. They
                    were finally moved out of the village that they were in last year and scattered
                    around. We continue to find people who have Bosnian passports who have no real
                    claim to Bosnian citizenship and in fact some of them were found in Afghanistan,
                    the passports at least of people who had been involved in this. Of course, as
                    you know this is not very firm ground for fundamentalism although there are some
                    people in Bosnia who are Islamists in that sense. There was wing within
                    Izetbegovic's party which always wanted and still wants an Islamic state under
                    Sharia law which would involve the creation within the federation of a strictly
                    Islamic state in the expulsion of Croats and Serbs and so forth. These people
                    have become stronger within the SDA as time was going on, but as they have
                    gotten stronger, the party has gotten weaker.</p>

                        thing together and the threat that has been there God knows how long of
                        Kosovo all of a sudden the Serbs making a move on to Kosovo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: No, it didn't loom very large unit of course the war came. At that point
                    it certainly was overhead in the sense that we had continual noise of warplanes
                    going overhead all the time. I think that the primary goal of everybody
                    concerned including the Bosnian Serbs was not to get drawn in. We spent a lot of
                    time talking to the Bosnian Serbs about distancing themselves from all this.
                    There is among the Bosnian Serbs a group that would like to see the RS become
                    part of Yugoslavia or Serbia. There are three separatists factions. There are
                    the Croats who would like to see Bosnian Croats become part of Croatia, there
                    are the Serbs who would like to see it become part of Serbia and then there are
                    the Islamists in Bosnia who would like to see an Islamic state created there.
                    This is what people were fighting about during the war, but we had taken a very
                    hard line saying that you all signed up for this deal, you can't get out of it
                    by holding a referendum or something like that, so live with it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes, I think it did, not as much as the final departure of Milosevic and
                    the departure of Tudjman from the scene. When they both left and new governments
                    came in which at least paid lip service to the idea of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
                    as an independent state, that decreased the attractive power of separatism. But
                    every time the Kosovo Albanians say we've got to have an independent Kosovo,
                    this causes people in both Belgrade and Banja Luka to say well if that's the

                        becoming independent. Did this have any effect on what you all were
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: The international community's position is that redrawing the map of the
                    Balkans would have serious consequences in terms of independence for those
                    entities within Bosnia which feel that they should be independent. So, our
                    advice to Montenegro was autonomy, not independence and of course now that
                    Milosevic is gone, pressure on Montenegro to stick with the federation has
                    increased I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You haven't mentioned dealing with the Croatians. How did
                        thaplay out while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, I suppose that was in some ways the most difficult problem that we
                    had. The Croatians felt themselves a threatened minority. The HDZ was a highly
                    centralized, highly paramilitary party especially after a coup within the party
                    in 1999 in which a military wing of the party took over with the sponsorship of
                    Tudjman. They felt cheated by the Dayton Agreement. They felt they needed to
                    have their own entity and many of them felt that they ought to secede and join
                    Croatia, which Tudjman welcomed, but of course, the post-Tudjman government just
                    hated the idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they hate the idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>BARRY: The Croats and Bosnia are known as sort of hillbillies of Croatia,
                    hardheaded, stubborn, involved in all kinds of criminal activities and it would
                    be sort of like inviting the Mafia to dinner. The Social Democrats in particular
                    in Croatia can't stand the sight of them. It would also shift the balance in
                    favor of the old HDZ in Croatia which was a party on the way out. There were
                    very many people in political life down there who deserved to be indicted and
                    some of them probably still will be. The Croatian generals, Tudjman's generals
                    were heavily involved in Croat politics there in Bosnia. The foreign minister,
                    for example, was widely suspected to be among the list of people about to be
                    indicted for war crimes. We tried hard to root out some of these people and some
                    of the rules for elections were designed to undermine the monopoly rule of the
                    HDZ in Croatian politics. In fact, in the 2000 election we did something that I
                    at the time had reservations about, but the high representative was in favor of
                    it and the steering board was in favor of it. We changed one rule that the
                    Croats were very fond of which gave essentially the HDZ a monopoly in the upper
                    house of the federation parliament and the ability to block everything that went
                    through. They then called for a referendum on election day, which would, be a
                    referendum sponsoring the idea of independence for Bosnian Croats. We said they
                    couldn't do it on election day and they went ahead and did it anyhow. We then
                    removed a number of people from office and removed some mandates from the HDZ,
                    which caused a big dustup with the international community. We tried hard to
                    work with moderates and of course, you could divide Croats by where they lived.
                    If they lived in exclusively Croat areas which were largely in what used to be
                    called Herzegovina, a coast area, they were pretty much all hardliners even the
                    Franciscan priests down there had been hardliners and were from the day of Ante
                    Pavelic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh God yes, I mean you know the burning the church at
                        Gleena anall that. The little brown brothers were not nice people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Now they're all through that area, there are monuments to the freedom
                    fighters of Ante Pavelic. But the people who lived in mixed areas were much more
                    moderate including the Cardinal and the priests that lived there and so forth.
                    So the moderates created a new political party, the NHI, but it never has gotten
                    any traction in the majority Croat areas which are still heavily hardline.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the situation on Mostar? I mean it's sort of a
                        nastthing with a cross on one side and the Bosniacs on the other?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>BARRY: We spent a lot of time on that. We had Americans running the OSCE in
                    Mostar like Gary Matthews. It's gotten better over time, but of course, you go
                    to Mostar, this is like Gallipoli. They fought each other from across the street
                    for two and a half years and the destruction was huge. So, for a very long time
                    it was considered worth your life if you were a Bosniac across the river to come
                    onto the Croat side. We did sponsor and support a moderate Croat Neven Tomich
                    who worked with a moderate Bosnian who tried to unify the administration in the
                    city and so forth. But Tomich was eventually expelled from the HDZ because he
                    was too moderate and the Bosniac was at odds with the rest of the SDA, so in a
                    way keeping that division going was in the interest of both nationalist
                    parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the big problem of resettlement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: It's going faster now in the last two years than ever. I think there were
                    70,000 minority returnees last year and this year it is projected to be 100,000.
                    You often wonder why these people want to go back. If you are a Muslim refugee
                    from Srebrenica do you really want to go back and live among these people again?
                    But they do and they are, roots run very deep in this part of the world. So, we
                    concentrated on trying to get people's property back for them. We intervened.
                    We'd go and fire the municipal authorities who were not promoting this. We would
                    write legal briefs for them. We would help them file the applications and over
                    time we've had some considerable success in getting people back their homes, but
                    of course, you can imagine, the local politicians had moved into the houses that
                    were vacated by the minorities, so we fired the politicians. I think that the
                    return process is coming to an end. People who have stayed out, are going to
                    stay out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know you look at, when I was in Dervantar which is
                        close to the Croatian border, there are houses that have just been blown up
                        all along the way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Oh, well that's what they did including after the war so thpeople wouldn't
                    return.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course, they blow up the mosques there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Now these places are being rebuilt. In the Serb majority areas in the RS,
                    Muslims are returning. There are Croats returning to the RS from Croatia. There
                    are communities being restarted, but this is coming at a time when there is not
                    nearly as much money as there used to be for reconstruction and housing. The
                    demand now for minority return exceeds the supply of houses for them to come
                    back into. Then you have to fight all these trivial things like how do you get
                    an i.d. card, how do you get your electricity reconnected, and how do you get
                    water because the local authorities don't want to provide these things for these
                    people in these areas.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Well, finally in July of 2001. I had planned to leave in the fall of 2000,
                    but at that point the U.S. didn't have a candidate to succeed me and I was asked
                    to stay on, so I stayed on for the implementation of the 2000 elections. I left
                    in July. Well, I left initially in May because that was the time I had planned
                    to, but I was asked to formally maintain the job as head of the mission and
                    until an appointment of a successor was arranged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: Bob Beecroft. There was a fight between the British and the Americans
                    about who would get the thing. The British finally withdrew the name of the
                    ex-general who was a candidate. So, Beecroft came in July. I went back in June
                    to turn the thing over and left then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling about whither Bosnia when you left
                        in '01?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARRY: It depends on what happens at the next election because the next election
                    is going to be in the hands of the Bosnians. The OSCE is not going to fund it;
                    it is not going to supervise it. They finally did pass an election law. The
                    nationalists badly want to get back in power. The SDA and HDZ are conspiring
                    with one another to return to the status quo ante, which was that we will
                    support you in anything you, the Bosnian nationalists want to do as long as you
                    let us the Croatian nationalists do whatever we want to do. If that happens, if
                    the nationalists win again and if the effort to contain the SDS and the RS
                    fails, then I think the international community is going to give up on Bosnia.
                    If on the other hand the so-called alliance parties, the alliance for progress,
                    the social democrats, the non-nationalist Croats, the current prime minister of
                    the Republic of Serbska, Mladen Ivanic, who was a moderate economist. If they
                    succeed in holding onto power, then I think the country has a future. The future
                    would be determined by what the citizens of the place are going to want to do.
                    Most of my friends, and I have a lot of friends there that say, well if this
                    thing goes back to the nationalists we want out of it. Most of the people who
                    worked for us are saving up their money so that if the time came when they
                    wanted to get out they had enough money to be an immigrant and a candidate and
                    all that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARRY: I think I'm going to go out and be an examiner for the board of examiners.
                    I volunteered, well, I went out to Kosovo and thought about taking a job in
                    Kosovo, but I found Pristina forbidding and I found the SRSG Hans Haekerup
                    forbidding, too. Haekerup has now quit after only a year. I announced my
                    availability to the OSCE if the U.S. wants to take the position of head of
                    mission of OSCE in Georgia, I would be happy to go there, otherwise.</p>

                <p>BARRY: She loved it. She has founded a U.S. NGO to support this Bosnia
                    handicrafts outfit. She is deeply involved in that still and she got very much
                    involved with women's groups there. I think it was as fascinating an experience
                    for her, of course, it had been our first post in the Foreign Service. She spoke
                    the language and enjoyed it immensely.</p>
