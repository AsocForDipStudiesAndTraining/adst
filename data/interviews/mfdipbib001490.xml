                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 30, 1996. This is an interview with Colonel
                        Richard R. Wyrough. This is being done on behalf of The Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If we can start a bit about when and where you were born,
                        and a little about your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: I was born in Trenton, New Jersey in 1927. I have an older sister who
                    presently lives in Balesville, New Jersey. My parents are both dead. My father
                    was associated with the Pennsylvania railroad. I grew up in New Jersey and went
                    to the local schools there, was appointed to West Point just at the end of the
                    Second World War — entered West Point in July of 1946, graduated in June of
                    1950.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I graduated in June of 1950. I assume your patron saint is
                        Eisenhower?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: That's true. With our class the Army changed the policy a little bit at
                    the academy. In contrast to earlier classes, they assigned us directly to units
                    on graduation on the theory that we had had enough of school. So quite a number
                    of the class went directly from graduation leave to Pusan in Korea, and as a
                    result we lost quite a few of the class. In fact, if you have an association
                    with Korea, you would be interested, this September a number of my classmates
                    are having a reunion in Seoul. We are to be guests for a week of the Korean
                    Veterans Association. That will launch for me a seven and a half week tour of
                    places in East Asia where I've not been.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I came here first to Washington on graduation in 1950, was assigned to the Third
                    Infantry Regiment as a platoon leader, later as the company commander. While I
                    was here, I enrolled in Georgetown graduate school. I thought of taking an
                    advanced degree in international relations. Coming into the library today, marks
                    the first time I've been in this building; first time in many, many years that
                    I've been on the campus. I served also as a White House aide, being a bachelor
                    at the time.</p>
                <p>In early '52 I went to Korea where I served as company commander of a heavy
                    mortar company with the Seventh Infantry Division, and upon returning from Korea
                    in November of that year...in those days it took a long time to be reassigned,
                    to go from unit to unit. I was crossing the Pacific by troop ship headed for
                    Seattle, President-elect Eisenhower was flying to Korea to fulfill his campaign
                    promise to end the war. Well, I got my assignment in the middle of the Pacific.
                    I was assigned as an infantry tactics instructor, at the medical replacement
                    training center in Camp Picket, Virginia, which sounded like a God-forsaken
                    spot. I visited there on leave before actually reporting. It was one street,
                    adjacent to Blackstone, Virginia. One street, next to a dirt covered town. I
                    went to the Pentagon and got my orders changed to Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, the
                    home of the signal corps which was rife with activity. Those were the days in
                    the Army - McCarthy hearings, and the Rosenberg problem.</p>
                <p>While I was at Forth Monmouth I was selected to complete my graduate studies in
                    Georgetown, preparatory to going back to West Point to teach in the area of
                    social sciences. So I graduated from Georgetown in 1955, and was married later
                    that year having met my wife here at Georgetown. She was the first woman to
                    graduate from the daytime Foreign Service school. We went to West Point and
                    served there for four years. I was assistant professor of U.S. Diplomatic
                    History.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a bit about this since diplomatic history is sort
                        of our bag here. As a career Foreign Service officer myself I found,
                        particularly with the older generations, kind of a gap in the military
                        knowledge of what the Foreign Service does of diplomacy. Whereas, at least
                        in my generation in the Foreign Service, almost all of us had time in the
                        military service. The Department had a knowledge of military service. Were
                        you able to get Foreign Service people to talk to your class?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: The professor at head of department when I was there...well, I was
                    selected by a man named Henry [last name unknown], he was perhaps the founder of
                    the department sometime right at the end of the Second World War. He retired the
                    year I arrived, and his successor was a man named George Lincoln who was a
                    prot�g�, I guess, of George Marshall's. I don't know how many people there
                    were...but from his position at West Point he was, my recollection during the
                    four years that we were there, he was frequently absent for assignments here in
                    Washington working on various commissions. As a cadet, and then later as an
                    instructor, my recollection was that the social science department at West Point
                    sponsored a range of activities and invited some very prominent people, both
                    diplomatic and military, senior positions in the government to speak to the
                    cadets. It was just a little bit like the War College here is able to tap
                    various senior people in the government. So there was a good flow back and
                    forth, I suppose, of diplomatic and military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left West Point when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: I left West Point in the summer of 1959 having just been promoted to
                    major, and went to Germany where I was an infantry officer assigned to an armor
                    division. My principal assignment there, in the course of a year, was the S-3,
                    or operations officer of a tank battalion, and then later battalion commander.
                    Do you have a military background, before your Foreign Service?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in the Air Force as an enlisted man but military
                        history has always been my bag.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: While I was with this tank battalion...in those days in Germany, there
                    was a fierce competition among armor units, tank battalions, for something
                    called the Seventh Army Tank Gunnery Trophy. As an infantry officer, my
                    battalion won it. I used to take great glee in goading over my armor friends. In
                    any event, after a year there, I was assigned as the senior aide to the Seventh
                    Army commander and served in that capacity for a couple of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Seventh Army commander when you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: His name was Garrison Davidson. His wife was a sister of Al Grunther. It
                    was from that perspective that we watched the developments leading up to the
                    construction of the Berlin Wall. During the summer of '61, I was assigned to the
                    job in the summer of '60, actually all through the spring and the summer of '61,
                    we would get these daily briefings by the staff about the influx of East Germans
                    into West Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As refugees.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: It was a tense moment. So I must say, like so many people having lived
                    through all of that, it was with great surprise that we watched the wall come
                    down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude within the Seventh Army about when
                        the wall went up? In the first place, did it come as a surprise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: I think as the summer wore on there was a sense that something had to
                    happen. Something had to be done to stop the flow. But it's been so long ago
                    that I'm not one of these people that have great instant recall. But I know that
                    my wife will tell stories now that we had to keep rations in the trunk of our
                    car. We had to periodically go on little exercises, to evacuate if necessary.
                    What kind of a mobilization there was? I just don't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously it was a time of tenseness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: Oh, it was certainly a time of tenseness, and I was really very
                    fortunate given my vantage point. I was able to accompany the Army commander as
                    he visited the units throughout the Army. We went into Berlin before the wall
                    went up. I was in Berlin after the wall was up, just before I came home. The
                    change was really quite dramatic. We visited units of the Seventh Army that were
                    very close to the East German border, the Czech border. There was a high state
                    of readiness and, I suppose, certainly some uncertainty as to just what was
                    going to happen.</p>
                <p>I came home from Germany in the spring of '62, after our youngest son had been
                    born in Germany. By then we had three sons. We came home on the USS
                    Independence. It was an interesting time. I accompanied General Davidson who was
                    then assigned to command the First Army in New York, Governor's Island, and I
                    had been selected before I came home to go to the Army Command Staff College. We
                    were at the Army's Command Staff College during the Cuban missile crisis.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>My first visit to Berlin, incidentally, backing up a little bit, was part of a
                    trip to Copenhagen and to the Netherlands. That was in April of '61 during the
                    Bay of Pigs.A year at the Leavenworth Command &amp; General Staff College, then
                    I came to Washington for my first three year assignment in the Pentagon. In the
                    military your assignments are certainly influenced by your networking and
                    previous assignments. So having had the four years at West Point I was assigned
                    to something called the Office of International Policy Plans, or something like
                    that, in the Army Staff Strategic Plans. That was very short lived, because I
                    was assigned as the Military Assistant to the Army General Council in his
                    capacity as special assistant to Cy Vance, who was then the Secretary of the
                    Army, but also the Defense member of an ad hoc group that was overseeing the
                    aftermath of the Bay of Pigs. The ransoming of all the brigade people. When I
                    joined the group, it was Al Haig and myself, and Joe Califano who was the
                    general counsel. We worked for Cy Vance.</p>
                <p>The Cuban exiles captured by Castro at the Bay of Pigs had been ransomed and they
                    were scattered in a series of small military posts around the country: Ft. Knox,
                    Ft. Benning, Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: The military was giving them a series of special courses, but shortly
                    after I arrived, they concluded that the troops were getting a bit restless and
                    something had to be done in order to terminate their special status, either by
                    easing them into civilian life, or by absorbing them in the military, but in an
                    ordinary way.</p>
                <p>Within weeks of my assignment, which was a month after Kennedy died, Cy Vance was
                    sworn is as the deputy secretary of Defense on January 28, 1964. He decided to
                    take the function of special representative for Cuban affairs up to the Defense
                    level. The other three people on his committee, as I recall, were John Hugh
                    Crimmins from State if you remember him, and Desmond Fitzgerald from the CIA,
                    and they met almost on a weekly basis.</p>
                <p>In any event, when he was named deputy secretary of Defense, because you have to
                    maintain parity among the military services as far as staff for senior civilian
                    positions in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, our group broke up. Al
                    Haig, who was senior to me and had been in the job a few months longer, went
                    with Vance and Califano. I was left to handle the Cuban brigade problem. After
                    six months, I went to the Office of the Army Chief of Staff in the summer of
                    '64.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Cuban brigade, these were Cubans?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: These were Cubans who had participated in the Bay of Pigs who had been
                    captured. There were several hundred, and I had, in effect, an employment office
                    working with the agencies of the preferred states, Texas, Florida, California,
                    New York. We developed a program in which we offered the Cubans employment
                    assistance if they wanted to leave the military and relocate. Or reviewing their
                    records, putting them into appropriate assignments in the military. That worked
                    quite satisfactorily and the program ended in about six months. In my later
                    military assignments I came across a number of these people who had opted to
                    stay in the military. I had not known much about the Cuban business before that,
                    but it was interesting. The number two man, somebody named Ole, I think, had an
                    obvious high degree of respect among his colleagues. Whereas, the number one
                    man, I think his name was Sam Mar, was not well respected. I think Ole may have
                    settled here in Washington eventually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Army chief of Staff position like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WROUGH: For the next two years, which coincided with President Johnson's gradual
                    build-up in the Vietnam War, McNamara was the Secretary of Defense. Anyway, we
                    had a half a dozen young officers who were in the Chief of Staff office, and
                    their responsibility was to monitor the actions of the large Army staff, and to
                    move the papers in and out. Creighton Abrams was the vice chief of staff. That
                    was my first close exposure to him. No, it was not. He was probably the finest
                    military officer with whom I came in contact over the years. He had been in
                    Germany in a senior assignment when I was there as the aide to the Army
                    commander.</p>
                <p>Looking back on Vietnam, I remember the trauma, and the misgivings, with which
                    the senior Army people viewed the build-up. And I remember hearing one of them
                    focus the dilemma: what do you do when you're in a senior position and your boss
                    is doing something that you don't think is quite right. Do you stick with it in
                    hopes of guiding it? Or do you resign and speak out in protest. A very difficult
                    position.</p>
                <p>From the Pentagon in the summer of '66, I was assigned as a student at the
                    Industrial College of the Armed Forces, a year at Ft. McNair. The theory being
                    that having been at West Point as an instructor in political science it would
                    have been a waste to go to the National War College. Instead, the Industrial
                    College at the time was regarded as the senior management school of the
                    military. That was a good year. Again, as we spoke earlier, exposure to lots of
                    very senior people, both at State and Defense, in the government, in the
                    academia. It was a good year.</p>
                <p>From there I went to Vietnam for three and a half years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you serve in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: I had been promoted to Lt. Colonel early in my Pentagon assignment, and
                    so my first assignment in Vietnam was command of a forward base about 5 or 10
                    miles from the Cambodian border due north of Saigon, in a province called Bin
                    Hoa. Our headquarters was in the middle of an old French rubber plantation. When
                    I arrived, the French still had their families living in these homes. The first
                    Sunday I was there, as the senior person, I was the guest for lunch at the home
                    of some French administrator, whatever his exact title was I don't remember, but
                    it was a very colonial setting. And within days the VC [Viet Cong] attacked our
                    base, the children and the families were all evacuated, and periodically on
                    weekends the wives would come back, leave the children in Saigon. It was a
                    relatively unreal, or surrealistic kind of situation.</p>
                <p>About a month after I arrived I was selected for promotion to Colonel, a full
                    colonel. And about that time General Westmoreland — one of his pet projects was
                    to expand and upgrade, from our perspective at least, the Vietnamese National
                    Military Academy, remaking it from a two-year technical school modeled after the
                    French style into a four year academic degree year awarding institution modeled
                    after West Point. I was selected to go there. I left my assignment up near the
                    Cambodian border on New Year's Day of 1968, headed for a series of briefings in
                    Saigon. By that time General Abrams was the deputy commander under Westmoreland.
                    In my interview with Westmoreland he said, now, tell me about yourself. You have
                    a good Army wife, I may want you to stay up there longer than...at that time
                    people were in and out in a year's time if they weren't carried out. That came
                    as something of a surprise. Young officers in those days, you don't have much
                    choice.</p>
                <p>So, General Abrams that night at dinner said, Well, Dick, you go on up there and
                    if you think it's worthwhile, then bring your wife and the boys to safe haven in
                    Baguio.</p>

                <p>WYROUGH: I arrived in Dalat, which was the home of the military academy, the
                    summer capital...</p>

                    out unless they were there for legitimate business. I arrived there in the
                    middle of January of '68. I was the senior American, was met by the deputy
                    province advisor, an American Army Lieutenant Colonel, and he took me to where I
                    would live for two years. I said, tell me about your defense plan. In effect, my
                    recollection was, he said, we don't have too much of a defense plan because this
                    is R&amp;R up here for both sides.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was sort of the story that went around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: So, I said, well, you present me with a contingency plan because your
                    responsibility is to advise the mayor, the province chief, my responsibility is
                    to see that the American community here is secure. You present me with an
                    up-dated plan. Which he did a week later, and I approved it and about a week
                    after that Dalat was one of the cities hit during Tet. It was an interesting
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about, as long I've got you on the
                        microphone, a little about what happened in Dalat during Tet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: Well, my team was in the process of being greatly expanded in size. We
                    had just rented a villa on top of a hill, across the street from the villa
                    occupied by the U.S. Military Police detachment in the city, who were there to
                    guard the airfield as I mentioned. And I had put four of my new officers into
                    this villa. One night the Vietnamese guards, military guards, didn't show up. We
                    must have gotten some sort of intelligence to put us on a little bit of alert.
                    But I ordered the men into my villa in a little better part of town, I guess.
                    And that night that villa, which was empty, as it turned out was the first
                    building hit in the city. It was on a ridge line, and the VC came down the ridge
                    line through the outskirts of the city, attacked that villa, went across the
                    street, attacked the military police villa, which happened to be on the high
                    ground immediately over the market place. The VC held the market place, as I
                    recall, for a couple of days, but we mobilized forces, both Vietnamese and U.S.,
                    and drove them out. The cadets at the academy were assigned rear guard, local
                    security missions, freeing up the regular Vietnamese military to join their
                    units in the counter against the VC. A Lt. General, First Field Forces
                    commander, would come in from time to time, set up his headquarters...if you're
                    familiar with Dalat, that grand hotel overlooking the city. And they established
                    something operating directly of First Field Forces Headquarters called Task
                    Force South. It was a combined military operation, U.S. units and working in
                    close coordination with ARVN [Army of the Republic of Vietnam] units of the 23rd
                    division. But over a period of ten days the Vietcong were driven out of the
                    city. There was some loss of life, but very little. And things returned to
                    normal. It came as a great shock to me as one of the military in the country, to
                    learn of the domestic reaction here. But that's another story, I don't want to
                    get into that.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>A month later, I took the first of a series of visits to all the U.S. supported
                    military institutions in the region, military academies, naval academies, air
                    force academies, Korean, Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia. Even
                    went down to Canberra in Australia to visit the Royal Military College to get a
                    feeling for their experiences and their efforts. The first one was to the
                    Philippine Military Academy. I checked out Baguio, decided that Baguio was not
                    the right place for my family. It was remotely located, it would have been
                    difficult to get to. But decided to bring them to Clark Air Base, they were
                    given a safe haven program such as the Foreign Service had in Bangkok and
                    Taiwan. At that time there were only three-four-five, six at the most, military
                    families of officers with special assignments in Vietnam whose presence was
                    necessary beyond the ordinary twelve months. By the time my wife left in the
                    summer of '70, that program had grown to about sixty families at that particular
                    location, and there were comparable increases, I think, in Bangkok and
                    elsewhere.</p>
                <p>We graduated the first four year class in December of 1969. It was an optimistic
                    moment. Ellsworth Bunker, as the ambassador, came up for the ceremony. I met him
                    then. General Abrams had come up a couple of times. I had been selected to
                    command this separate brigade that operated directly out of the First Field
                    Forces, called Task Force South, its headquarters by that time was in a small
                    town on the coast, but north of Saigon, south of Cameron Bay. I had three U.S.
                    battalions under my direct control, and my headquarters was co-located with the
                    headquarters of the assistant division commander of the 23rd ARVN, and he had
                    usually under his control four ARVN battalions. So we had a sizeable force. Our
                    responsibility was what the military calls an economy of force effort. Our area
                    of responsibility was the southern four provinces of First Field Forces. That
                    included Dalat, the two coastal provinces, and the province in which Dalat was
                    located.</p>
                <p>I turned over my command, in those days those brigade commands were six months
                    only. I turned over my brigade in June of 1970, having served almost three years
                    in country. Came back to the Pentagon for my second assignment. There I was
                    assigned to Latin American affairs. Except for the six months with Cuban
                    affairs, I had no background but there was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of
                    Defense for Latin American affairs who had remembered me from those days, and
                    although I really didn't want the assignment, I got it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to get just a little feel about this. In the

                        separate thing, and considered by many in the Foreign Service kind of second
                        rate because...</hi>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: Years later when I retired from the Army and joined the Foreign Service
                    (1974), I was assigned to Inter-American affairs. That was the understanding
                    that I had of how the Foreign Service viewed assignments in Inter-American
                    affairs. Yet, in retrospect, people in that area were more likely to get
                    embassies...and the fact that so many of the political appointees don't want
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling of the military toward this when you
                        went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: Brent Scowcroft had been in my office. I arrived in August of 1970, and
                    Brent had left that June for an assignment in the White House as...whatever jobs
                    he eventually had. Brent, incidentally, was one of the group of people who had
                    been at West Point teaching social sciences.</p>
                <p>I didn't want the assignment, but not so much because it was Latin America, as
                    much as because it was taking me out of the Army environment at a key time. I
                    don't really recall any particular view as far as never wanting to be assigned
                    to Panama. SOUTHCOM I regarded distinctly as a backwater compared to Seventh
                    Army, or the Asian assignments in Korea and Vietnam. But that's where I ended
                    up. I tried to get out of it but without any success in contrast to my
                    successful effort to be relocated from Camp Picket to Fort Monmouth.
                    Incidentally, I went to the Pentagon and I went through a series of people way
                    back in those days saying I had personal reasons for wanting to be reassigned.
                    Eventually got to the chief of infantry officer assignments. And he said, what's
                    your personal reason? I said, if you must know, I'm a bachelor, I've just come
                    from ten months in Korea, send me back to Korea.</p>
                <p>I used to tell that story to my cadets at West Point as evidence that the Army
                    really does have heart. But they had no heart by the time I got to ISA
                    [International Security Affairs], the Office of Inter-American Affairs. My first
                    assignment was, I was responsible for Panama, Central America and Mexico. And in
                    that capacity the first State Department country director for Panama with whom I
                    came in contact with was Brandon Grove. Mike Skol who just returned from a
                    Vietnam tour was a brand new desk officer for Costa Rica. And an AID officer,
                    named Dick Breen, I think, was the country director for Central America, his
                    deputy was a man named Morey Bell. I forget who some of the other people
                    were.</p>
                <p>In any event, after about six months in that area, I guess for personal
                    interests, and with the tolerance by the director in office who was an Army
                    Major General, later Lieutenant General, and the Assistant Secretary, who by
                    that time was a man named John Leddy, a career Foreign Service officer, I sort
                    of shifted my responsibilities and got out of the geographic short-term focus
                    and began to deal with region-wide, longer-term planning and policy. In those
                    days Henry Kissinger...</p>

                <p>WYROUGH: We're talking about the late 1970 and the first half of '71. Kissinger
                    was still at the NSC, and they were looking at the strength of the military
                    groups that were scattered around. So for the next two and a half years I had
                    essentially no responsibilities with respect to Panama or Central America, or
                    Mexico, but I did have these military policy responsibilities for the region as

                        concerns about it? We're talking about around 1970-'71.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: I don't remember that there was any serious concerns about the Mexican
                    military. I only visited Mexico once in that time, and I remember visiting the
                    embassy, and the city. It was in December of 1970 because it happened that there
                    was snow, and the palm trees in the La Reforma area were covered with snow that
                    night and the following morning. But I have no recollection of any serious
                    concerns arising in the brief time that I was involved with that area. I have a
                    home in Mexico, and I have tried to stay in touch with the people in the embassy
                    — not so much anymore, but up until maybe about three years ago, when John
                    Negroponte left. And I had a deputy who served with the number two man in the
                    political section up until about '92. And Bob Pastorino, who was the deputy
                    there, DCM, before he went to be ambassador in Santo Domingo. He was a close
                    friend. Now the Mexican military...I sense they are well paid, and well housed
                    relatively, they're kept happy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were dealing with group management, the various
                        military groups scattered around North America, did you start moving off
                        anywhere with that group? I mean, looking at all of Latin America, what sort
                        of responsibilities did that cover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: We were concerned about the relationship between the U.S. military
                    presence, the so-called mil-groups, and the larger diplomatic presence on the
                    one hand. And then the relationship between the U.S. military and the host
                    military. We wanted to be sure that we were not speaking with two voices, that
                    the military effort was carefully integrated. That it was not contributing to an
                    overly military influence on the governments in the area. At that time, there
                    were lots of military dictatorships. It was right at the beginning of the time
                    when our military groups were rather substantially reduced. They were reduced
                    down to less than 200, if I remember correctly. Also, I was responsible within
                    the office, for providing the views of the office to the Secretary of Defense
                    with regard to our military presence as reflected by SOUTHCOM [Southern
                    Command]. I remember that we really tried unsuccessfully to have SOUTHCOM
                    disestablished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: SOUTHCOM waxes and wanes but it's really a very important
                        command and I was wondering what would trigger...I mean, you'd have to have
                        something to put in its place in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: Nothing really comes to mind quickly, and my views on that subject have
                    evolved over the years. I would not want to ascribe to myself, or to the office,
                    views that I really don't remember. In any event, the fortunes of the military
                    in general...I'm not talking about Latin America, but the reputation of our
                    military was plummeting in those early years of the '70s because of the
                    anti-Vietnam feelings. I would come in and out of the Pentagon, and you'd never
                    know who it was that you would have to walk by, or what demonstration was going
                    on. I decided that with three young sons rapidly approaching college age, and
                    with no particular financial resources, that I would retire and go into civilian
                    life. So in order to prepare for that at the end of my three years in the
                    Pentagon, I took an assignment on the faculty at the Industrial College of the
                    Armed Forces [ICAF].</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>I had just been selected to become what they called the Dean of Students in late
                    January of '74 when I got a call from this Foreign Service officer whose name I
                    mentioned, Morey Bell, who explained that he was then the office director for
                    Panama Affairs, and at the same time wore a hat as the deputy to Ellsworth
                    Bunker who had been named the previous summer by President Nixon as our chief
                    negotiator for a new Canal Treaty. He thereupon put Ambassador Bunker on the
                    line, who explained that he had been given this portfolio by President Nixon,
                    and he had spent the last six months reviewing the situation. He continued that
                    he had come to the conclusion that he needed somebody with a military background
                    to assist him in winning over the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs, and was I
                    interested. Well, given my particular situation, and given my career-long
                    interest in political-military affairs, that seemed like a happy confluence of
                    things, and I accepted, retired from the Army, joined the Foreign Service with a
                    reserve commission, what they then called...they hadn't yet gone to the senior
                    Foreign Service, but I had a FS-2 appointment for five years. And I joined
                    Ambassador Bunker's staff as a senior advisor. I was physically located in the
                    office of Panamanian Affairs and given the title of Special Advisor for Treaty
                    Negotiation Affairs. Brandon Grove had left, I don't know whether Morey
                    succeeded him directly or not but he was the office director. In those days
                    Inter-American Affairs offices were integrated with the AID offices to a much
                    greater degree, I think, than most of the other regional bureaus. The custom was
                    that either the office director was an AID officer, or the deputy. In my case
                    there was an AID officer who was the deputy, Pat Morris, I think.</p>
                <p>A year later Morris was reassigned and replaced by Ed Nadeau as the AID deputy.
                    In addition to carrying out my negotiating responsibilities, since the office of
                    Panamanian Affairs doubled also as the staff for the negotiator, I was also
                    given a title of deputy director and continued in that capacity until early
                    1980. In August of 1977, within days of the public announcement that we had
                    reached agreement with Panama on the terms of a new treaty, Morey Bell was
                    reassigned. There was a man who came in eventually, a man named Jim Haahr, a
                    senior Foreign Service officer. About the time Haahr arrived, Nadeau moved on
                    and I became the sole deputy. He served as the office director from the fall of
                    1977 until he either was retired or was reassigned in January or February of
                    1980, where-upon I became the acting director. And through a series of
                    organizational changes remained as the director of Panama Affairs until I
                    retired in September of 1990.</p>
                <p>That essentially is my personal career. I'll stop at that point and let you

                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: I was on the staff of the faculty of the Industrial College of the Armed
                    Forces, which is the senior management school for the military located at Fort
                    McNair. I had just been designated as the Dean of Administration when I got a
                    call asking me to join Ellsworth Bunker's team to help negotiate, or try to
                    negotiate a new treaty with Panama to replace the then existing treaty of 1902.
                    So I retired from the Army, accepted a Foreign Service reserve appointment, and
                    actually began work on the first of May of 1974. The state of play of the
                    negotiations at that point were basically...Ambassador Bunker had returned to
                    Washington from Saigon the previous summer, had been named by President Nixon as
                    our chief negotiator for a new Panama treaty. Ambassador Bunker had had some
                    exploratory talks with the Panamanians which led to a visit to Panama in
                    February of 1974, by then Secretary of State Kissinger. And out of that trip
                    came something called the {Panamanian Foreign Minister Juan) Tack-Kissinger
                    Principles which was essentially the conceptual framework for a new treaty that
                    was to guide the negotiators in their efforts to reach a mutually acceptable
                    treaty, or treaties, instead of agreements to replace the then existing treaty
                    which had governed our relationship and our activities with regard to Panama
                    since its inception in 1902.</p>

                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: Way back in January of 1964, President Johnson had been in office just a
                    couple of months, and there were some riots in Panama in opposition to the then
                    treaty, particularly to the two features which the Panamanians found so
                    objectionable, the in perpetuity, and the rights as if sovereign. Our interests
                    then, as it had been for some time, and as it continues today I suppose, our
                    principal interest was to be able to use the canal. President Johnson sent then
                    Secretary of the Army Vance to Panama to head up a team to look at the
                    situation. He came back and sometime in '64, again the details escape me, the
                    President announced his decision to enter into negotiations with Panama to
                    up-grade, or modernize the then relationship. And thus began in 1964 an extended
                    period of negotiations which went on until the treaties were concluded in
                    1977.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The first couple of efforts on the U.S. side were headed by Robert Anderson who
                    had been Eisenhower's Secretary of the Treasury. He put together a team drawn
                    from State and Defense, and the Army because it was the Army that had the
                    responsibility for governing the canal zone. And those first negotiations
                    resulted in a series of draft treaties that were leaked prematurely, I think by
                    the Chicago Tribune, sometime in 1967. But the manner in which the treaties were
                    revealed in effect killed them, they were stillborn. The Panamanians rejected
                    them, and for domestic-political reasons I think we professed to be not terribly
                    happy with the product of three years of negotiations.</p>
                <p>The election of 1968 brought President Nixon to office. He reappointed Robert
                    Anderson as the chief U.S. negotiator in 1970. By that time there had been a
                    revolution in Panama. Omar Torrijos, a young national guard officer with a
                    couple of cohorts threw out the elected civilian government. And negotiations
                    began a second time in 1970 or very early '71. But they really went nowhere.
                    Both sides sort of went through the motions but without significant
                    progress.</p>

                        not the public thing, what were the things that, say in the Chicago

                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: The Panama Canal...Let's talk first on the U.S. side. The Panama
                    canal...20th century America grew up with the canal. They had an enormous pride
                    of accomplishment. There was in the mid-'70s a movie about Theodore Roosevelt
                    and there was a diplomatic incident in Morocco...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. The Wind and the Lion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: The Wind and the Lion was the name of the movie, and in actual history
                    the American consul general in Tangier, I think, was a man named Pedecaris. In
                    the movie Pedecaris became a very attractive female, Candice Bergen, who was
                    kidnapped at some point in the movie by Sean Connery, who played a bigger than
                    life Moroccan sheik, Mulay Achmed Mohammed el-Raisuli the Magnificent. Pedecaris
                    alive, or Raisuli dead, was Roosevelt's theme. At one scene in that movie, the
                    first family had gathered in the White House for a birthday party honoring the
                    President. He got out his saber and prepared to cut the cake, and the camera
                    zeroed in on the cake and it was a map of the western hemisphere with the Panama
                    Canal prominently pictured. The sword went through the canal and the audience
                    cheered widely in support of the president. There was a lot of old fashioned
                    nationalistic feeling within the United States that limited the flexibility of
                    the U.S. negotiators, that required an educational campaign to convince people
                    that sovereignty, or rights as if sovereign in perpetuity were not really the
                    U.S. national interests, but only use of the canal.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>On the Panamanian side, Panama grew up with this foreign presence in its middle.
                    I've come to think of Panama in some ways as an abused child. It had never known
                    anything other than an overwhelming American presence. And it was a natural
                    issue designed to arouse the nationalistic feelings against the Yankees for
                    anybody who wanted to make a few domestic political points. They objected most
                    strenuously to this foreign presence, heavily militarized, going down the middle
                    of the country. And they regarded this presence as denying them their just use
                    of their location which they regarded as their greatest natural resource.</p>
                <p>In any event, the riots of 1964 were simply the culmination of a series of
                    incidents over a number of years prior to that time. That made uncertain our
                    continued peaceful use of the canal short of turning it into an armed camp.
                    Therefore, President Nixon, like his predecessor, concluded that it was in our
                    interest to negotiate a new relationship. To modernize the relationship that
                    governed our activities there. The treaty of 1902 was a lopsided treaty. It gave
                    us lots of rights, and gave Panama very little. It was in tune with the times in
                    which it was established, but it became some 60 or 70 years later, quite out of
                    date with international norms of behavior. It was a constant thorn in the side
                    of efforts by the United States to improve our relations with many of the Latin
                    American countries. So those were the principal issues.</p>
                <p>And in the meantime, of course, from the moment that the canal opened I think in
                    1913, to the time in which we're talking about, the negotiating period from '64
                    through '77, the nature of the canal's contribution changed rather significantly
                    from the U.S. perceptive. In its early days it was an important artery
                    economically and also militarily. It remained an important military artery
                    through the first World War, the Second World War, even into the period of the
                    Korean War and the Vietnam War. But by the time of the Vietnam War, the nature
                    of our Navy had changed significantly. Our major ships were no longer
                    battleships, they were the aircraft carriers, and nuclear submarines were a
                    major element of our Navy. None of our aircraft carriers could use the canal,
                    and our nuclear subs, for operational reasons, would not use it. So the military
                    value of the canal dropped significantly during that period. It remained in the
                    early '70s, the Joint Chiefs of Staff regarded it as an important military
                    asset, not what they called a vital asset. Nothing that required, in effect,
                    going to war over. So the public opinion about the canal's value inflated it
                    above its real value. Economically it was an important carrier, particularly of
                    commodities. But as the '70s wore on, it became clear that with the advent of
                    containerization, that more and more alternatives were developing that offered a
                    partial substitute at least for the canal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Containerization being...could you explain that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: Well, containerization cargoes, today for example, in the mid-1990's, we
                    have something called the land bridge by which cargoes cross the Pacific from
                    East Asia, are unloaded in Los Angeles or Long Beach, or in Seattle-Tacoma, and
                    they are transported in containers suitable for offloading onto railway cars.
                    The railway cars move these containers piggy-back across the country, and then
                    at selected points on these rail routes the individual containers are offloaded
                    and carried by truck to their final destinations. For a transporter who wants to
                    move something from East Asia to Amsterdam, if it goes by container it can be
                    transported faster, and at less cost today by this so-called land bridge than by
                    moving on the all water route through the Panama Canal. There has been in the
                    last 15 years a dramatic increase in the volume of traffic moving on the land
                    bridge as distinct from volumes moving through the canal. In any event, that's
                    getting a little bit ahead of the story.</p>
                <p>The principal U.S. interest which we wanted to protect and serve was our
                    continued and uninterrupted peaceful use of the Panama Canal. In addition, we
                    had a series of military bases there. Bases principally established to protect
                    the canal, to secure the canal, but also to display the flag, I suppose, in that
                    southern region. And over the years some of those bases seemed to have outlived
                    their usefulness. But nevertheless we wanted to maintain a military presence.
                    From the Panama's point of view, we were giving them in 1970 something like two
                    million dollars a year annuity. They had long ago sold the annuity to a New York
                    bank, so they really got very little, but they felt that they should be getting
                    much more than two million dollars. So there were economic issues. There had
                    developed within the Canal Zone...there was some measure of discrimination.
                    There was a practice, not dissimilar I suppose, to the separate but equal
                    doctrine of the United States at the time. There was something called the Gold
                    and Silver. You had one set of water fountains and public toilets for
                    Panamanians, and another for Americans. All of the senior management decisions
                    within the Panama Canal, companies that ran the Panama Canal were American.
                    There were no Panamanians. A vast number of employees were Panamanian, but the
                    managers were American. So the Tack-Kissinger principles announced in February
                    of 1974, after a period of several months negotiating by Ambassador Bunker,
                    these were broadly stated principles, both sides agreed to them. They were
                    designed to provide the framework for this new modern relationship, this new
                    treaty that would replace the old, and that would deal with the problems of
                    perpetuity, military presence, economic benefits, citizen rights, what to do
                    about a new canal. In 1967, one of the treaties that had been negotiated, and
                    that was prematurely publicized, was a treaty to build a sea level canal. Both
                    sides wanted to examine the situation and reach mutually agreed judgment as to
                    what should be done over the longer term as far as best utilizing for the
                    benefit of both countries, and international commerce at that location.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The statement of principles represented a departure from the previous negotiating
                    efforts, particularly of the first set of treaties. Both sides negotiated
                    specific texts almost from the beginning. Ambassador Bunker felt that it was
                    important to agree in broad terms on a comprehensive framework, and then to take
                    those individual principles and to convert them into more finite conceptual
                    agreements. And once we were able to deal satisfactorily in that manner with
                    each of the issues relating to the seven or eight principles, we could then, and
                    only then, go into the actual negotiating of treaty language. And that is what
                    guided our efforts from 1974 until 1977 when the treaties were concluded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to what your role was, you're a professional
                        Army officer, Industrial War College, what were you getting in your own
                        heart, but also from the officers that you knew about the Panama Canal up to
                        this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: Well, there are two or three questions there. Let's take my involvement
                    first from Ambassador Bunker's point of view.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Bunker, having returned from a number of years in Saigon as our
                    ambassador, and having developed many very close personal relationships with a
                    series of high military officers, having analyzed where we appeared to be as far
                    as this task that President Nixon had given him, concluded that he could not
                    hope to solve his problem, accomplish his task without strong support by the
                    Pentagon. He had to have the backing of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint
                    Chiefs of Staff, if he could hope to succeed in convincing the American public
                    that any treaty that he was personally comfortable with was truly in the
                    interest of the United States. Therefore, he wanted on his team someone with a
                    military background who could help to build bridges. And he picked me. The
                    reason that he picked me principally, I had known his civilian deputy in my
                    three years on Inter-American Affairs in the office of the Secretary of Defense,
                    in what is called ISA, International Security Affairs. And I had met Ambassador
                    Bunker briefly in Vietnam during that part of my tour when I was the senior
                    adviser at the military academy which was a project of some interest to him.</p>
                <p>From my point of view, the offer which was quite unexpected occurred at a time
                    when my personal interest had begun to shift from the Army. The offer was to
                    become involved in something that I had known a bit about before. When Secretary
                    Vance was sent to Panama in January of 1964, I had just been appointed to his
                    staff. As I recounted earlier, with my involvement in Cuban affairs. In graduate
                    school my principal professor here at Georgetown was a diplomatic historian,
                    Charles Hansel, who helped to excite me about the Panama Canal, and Theodore
                    Roosevelt's role in that particular episode in our diplomatic history. It
                    occurred to me that Ambassador Bunker was doing absolutely the right thing. He
                    was taking the right approach in trying to modernize our relationship, and it
                    seemed to me personally that it was an effort that was fruitful and beneficial
                    to the country and deserved active involvement and work.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>My military colleagues in the Pentagon at the time had a somewhat different view.
                    My decision to retire in order to join in this effort was generally speaking
                    viewed with surprise and suspicion. I was able to maintain contacts, to develop
                    contacts, strengthen relationships, but the difference between the common
                    military view of our interest in Panama, and that held by Ambassador Bunker, and
                    myself, and others at State was quite different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting people coming up to you throwing their
                        arm over your shoulder at the officer's club and saying, Dick don't give
                        away the store.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: Oh, I still get friends who jokingly introduce me as the man who helped
                    give away the Panama Canal. And indeed, when the treaties were concluded some
                    three years later, and almost immediately sent to the Senate for its advice and
                    consent, the negotiating team and others embarked on a major educational effort
                    to build support. We never really were successful at the time in persuading a
                    majority of the American public that the treaties were in our interest.</p>
                <p>I'll just say, while I'm thinking about it. I always felt, and I still feel, that
                    we really were engaged in three negotiations simultaneously. There was the
                    obvious negotiation between Panama and the United States. There was a
                    negotiation between State and Defense. And there was negotiation with the
                    American public. In some respects the negotiation with Panama was easier than
                    the other two. But I guess that's not uncommon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a matter of fact, I've talked to people who have been
                        engaged in dealing with treaty negotiations, status of forces and all, and
                        they say it's difficult with Turkey or Greece, but the real problem is with
                        the Pentagon lawyers. This is from a State perspective. I'm talking about
                        the military. Was this a visceral reaction, it's ours, we got it, and what
                        the hell are we doing giving it up. Or were they saying, we bought it, we
                        paid for it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: There was some in the early days of my involvement some measure of that,
                    but as time wore on, you got less and less of that among the military. But you
                    got a lot of it by the public at large. I spoke in half of the states in the
                    union in the course of about six months, to Rotary groups, college groups, civic
                    groups, world affairs councils. Only in a small minority of cases did you find
                    groups of citizens who were sympathetic. I would often take a poll at the
                    beginning and at the end, a show of hands. With some measure we succeeded. We
                    wanted to convert as many of the uncertains as possible, and neutralize the
                    rabid opponents. The treaties, of course, were ratified by the narrowest of
                    margins in the Senate. But that's again moving ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the Panama Canal Zone people...I'm
                        talking about right at the beginning, had they an effective lobby? Because
                        I'd always heard that they were a breed apart who were a little bit like
                        anti-bellum plantation owners, and they weren't a very sympathetic crew as
                        far as most Americans were concerned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: I think they were holier than the Pope. They had a colonial mentality.
                    They're like the Northern Ireland, the Ulsterites of today. The Malvinas
                    residents of the Argentine-British war of whenever it was. It was their life
                    that was substantially changed, and they remained opponents from the beginning.
                    They remained opponents from the beginning to the end. It's worthy, I think, to
                    provide this brief background.U.S. affairs in Panama were managed somewhat
                    differently from most places in the world. The Ambassador's authority ceased at
                    the boundaries of the Canal Zone. Within the Canal Zone the governor was king.
                    His principal tenant was a senior military officer called the CINCSOUTH, the
                    commander of U.S. forces southern command, which had responsibility for all of
                    our military activities throughout South America and Central America. The
                    Caribbean was the responsibility of CINCLANT [Commander in Chief, Atlantic] a
                    naval commander headquartered in Norfolk. But southern command headed by an Army
                    general was resident in the Canal Zone. So you had something called, partly as a
                    result of the disturbances of '64, I think, and simply as a means of
                    coordinating internal government activities in relationships with the host
                    country, with Panama. There was established by President Johnson, as I recall,
                    in the mid-'60s, something called the Panama Review Committee, the PRC, composed
                    of the ambassador, the CINC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about Ambassador...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: The United States Ambassador to Panama. Normally, as you know, the
                    ambassador is the head of the country team, and while that was so in Panama, his
                    authority was substantially limited by the existence of the Panama Canal Zone. I
                    can remember, while I was still in the Army, in ISA in 1970 and '71, attending
                    meetings called by the then office director of Panama Affairs to meet with the
                    then U.S. ambassador to Panama, Bob Sayre. I can remember so vividly Bob Sayre
                    expressing great frustration over the limits on his authority posed by the
                    existence of the Canal Zone, and by the role of the governor, and by the role of
                    the CINC. The ambassador was nominally the senior person as far as the
                    allocation of U.S. resources, but in fact you have all of the military, and the
                    largest single U.S. resource in Panama was, of course, the Canal. That was a
                    source of constant irritation, and if my recollection serves me correctly, there
                    had been a history of differences among strong personalities, the CINC, the
                    governor, the ambassador, over a period of years. In my experience the several
                    ambassadors, beginning with Bill Jordan, who was our ambassador in 1974, and the
                    several ambassadors who succeeded him, the relationships within the PRC were
                    highly cordial except perhaps for a brief period at the height of the Noriega
                    crisis in 1989.</p>
                <p>You had the ambassador, you had the CINC who was either a three or four star
                    general...</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can I ask you a question about the CINC? Looking at it
                        from both your perspective within the Army, and looking back on it, this is
                        a highly political position this CINC because of the importance of traveling
                        around. What is your impression of the care that was taken in choosing CINC
                        Southern Command? Here they were having to deal with the Latin
                        Americans...it's a highly political job. I have the feeling that at the time
                        of the Noriega crisis that they didn't have a politically sensitive person
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: As a matter of fact I think it they had a CINC who regarded himself, and
                    who had been probably trained extensively in the politics and in the culture of
                    Latin America...he was married to a Latin American. I don't know what
                    nationality. There were certainly some problems there, but again that's getting
                    way ahead of the story.</p>
                <p>Generally I think that the CINC's had perhaps more sensitivity to the Latin
                    American scene than you might think. As time passed that became a more obvious
                    characteristic. It may be that in the '60s there were a couple who were chosen
                    primarily perhaps for their military background because they had the right
                    seniority. I don't have a lot of knowledge about that but later on the last CINC
                    of the pre-treaty period, General Dennis McAuliffe, retired on the last day that
                    the old treaties remained in effect. He became a civilian and as a civilian, was
                    given the title of Administrator of the Panama Canal Commission. He was
                    extremely sensitive to the political nuances of the situation. He was the sole
                    American administrator from 1979 when the treaties entered into force, until
                    1988 when, under the terms of the treaty Panama proposed, and our president
                    appointed, a Panamanian national as the number one man of the U.S. agency known
                    as the Panama Canal Commission which succeeded the Panama Canal Company in
                    having the mission of operating the canal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the governors? What was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: I started to say that, in contrast to the CINC, the governors did not
                    have as strong a record, I would say, of sensitivity to Panamanian feelings.
                    They had the difficult task, I suppose, of representing the Zonians, and of not
                    appearing to be hostile to their interest. I mean to the extent they were
                    perceived by the Zonians as hostile to their interest. Their job was
                    considerably more difficult. So often the governor would serve as a mouthpiece
                    for Zonian concerns. It's interesting that the governor, and he was always
                    called The Governor, had two hats. He was the president of the Panama Canal
                    Company charged by U.S. law with operating the canal, and then he was also the
                    governor charged with governing the Canal Zone territory of the United
                    States.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>In visits to the offices, I guess, of the last governor during the negotiating
                    years, I remember one incident where clearly he saw himself first, as the
                    governor, second, as the president of the Canal Company.</p>
                <p>To answer your question, I would give CINC by and large pretty good grades, the
                    governors, some were good, others had to strike a balance in their own minds in
                    discharging their responsibilities which sometimes were in conflict.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also of this triumvirate, the ambassadors weren't
                        always of the top. Sometimes they were just sort of political patronage
                        types too, weren't they? One ambassador during a critical time who just up
                        and left. He never bothered to resign, he just left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: I don't remember that. But Panama, our representation there in my
                    experience, had a mix both of political and career appointees. I think,
                    especially as my time wore on at State, my natural bias was in favor of the
                    career appointee. I have to say, based upon my 16 years there, that there were
                    some things that political appointees could do much better than career. Given
                    the peculiar nature of Panama in the domestic-political scene, that was
                    extremely important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A political appointee can often reach out, both one, to
                        the president, or to those in power, if they really have political
                        connections. Some really are just money, but other ones have real power of
                        their own which they can bring in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: As you know, the State Department Foreign Service assignment policies
                    are such that it's unusual, I believe, for someone to spend as much time with
                    one country as I did with Panama. From '74 until '90. So I got to know rather
                    well all the U.S. ambassadors, and all the Panamanian ambassadors here, so it
                    was an interesting time, as well as the CINCs and the governors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're sort of setting the stage for this thing. What was
                        your impression of the Panamanian representation here in Washington? Both on
                        the ground, and also maybe any delegations they sent.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: The ambassadors got distinctly mixed grades in terms of ability and
                    influence. That could be a subject if you want to go into it at a later time, I
                    could evaluate the different ones. They generally tried to put topnotch people
                    here. They did not always succeed. The man who is presently Panama's Foreign
                    Minister was their ambassador in the climatic months of the negotiation in the
                    first months of Carter's administration, from January of '77 until August or
                    September. As soon as the treaties were concluded, he returned to Panama. He was
                    a businessman, a political appointee, a confidant of General Torrijos, a leading
                    oppositionist to the Noriega government, was very active from Washington in
                    leading efforts against that. Indeed, now that the party of Noriega is back in
                    power, here he is the Foreign Minister. A pragmatist, a wheeler-dealer, a
                    capable person. Others have different characteristics. Usually the ambassadors
                    here were close to the president or the senior persons in the Panamanian
                    government, as you would expect. The United States is the big brother, the big
                    enchilada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the estimation. What were you getting from the
                        team Bunker had, and from Bunker. Torrijos was the person who was going to
                        call the shots, and where did they figure he was coming from? Or who were
                        some of the players?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: Clearly General Omar Torrijos Herrera was the strong man in Panama.
                    Nothing happened without his okay. He was not a front man. He was the strong
                    man, he was the person in control. He had a group around him, a mixed group,
                    civilians and generally leftists, I suppose, some more than others who kept the
                    extreme left in line. Torrijos' chief negotiator, and Bunker's counterpart, was
                    a man named Romulo Escobar Bethancourt, a man who died here a year or so ago. At
                    the time he was the rector of the University of Panama, and a prominent leftist
                    intellectual within Panama. He was the senior person. There were...I haven't
                    thought about the composition of their team in some time. There was another
                    international lawyer, relatively conservative who later became Panama's
                    ambassador. There was Panama's senior diplomat, a man who is presently Panama's
                    ambassador in London, Aquilino Boyd. He had been Foreign Minister a couple of
                    times, had an extended period as his country's ambassador to the United Nations.
                    Nicolas Ardito Barletta, who later became vice president of the World Bank for
                    Latin America, at the time was Torrijos' Minister of Planning, who later was
                    elected president of Panama in the spring of 1984, who was sworn in in October
                    of '84, and then ousted by Noriega in September of '85. The ambassador from
                    Panama to the United States then was a young 20-something Torrijos in order to
                    deal with the Oligarchy people, which traditionally had held the political power
                    as well as the economic power in the country, recruited some young Oligarchs to
                    his cause. He was basically a populist. One of those young Oligarchies was the
                    ambassador here at the time, Nicholas Gonzales [last name unknown]. It was a
                    balanced team. There was a black lawyer, who years later and who today, who was
                    not in the government, but who is an elder statesman of the government, and who
                    during the years of the Noriega crisis, I regarded as one of the most sensible
                    Panamanians to whom I could always go if there were problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Panama's president today was one of these young Oligarchs, who sort of floated
                    around the negotiating scene. The negotiations as I first encountered them, were
                    conducted in a rather informal way. The manners of the negotiation that Bunker
                    chose with the concurrence of his Panamanian counterpart reflected the political
                    sensitivities domestically on both sides of the issue. At a negotiating session
                    would be Ambassador Bunker and his deputy, and a lawyer, and Bunker would have a
                    staff assistant. They were the ones that came down in March or April of 1974
                    before I joined the team in order to reach agreement with Panama over the major
                    issues that needed to be addressed under each of the Tack-Kissinger principles.
                    Tack having been Kissinger's counterpart, Foreign Minister of Panama.</p>
                <p>My first visit to Panama as a member of the negotiating team was in August of
                    1974. At the time Ambassador Bunker was receiving guidance from the White House,
                    go slow in '74, but expedite in '75. We're talking about elections, and of
                    course in '74 we're talking about the weakened position of the president because
                    of Watergate. I came down to Panama with President Nixon in office, and I
                    listened to his resignation speech on the balcony of the Lieutenant Governor
                    overlooking the canal with the foghorns in the background, came home with
                    President Ford having been sworn in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling on your team that the Panamanians
                        were watching our political scene, and figuring out how to play it, and
                        maybe taking advantage of what they considered might be a weakening
                        situation. Or did they see this weakening of Nixon as perhaps being harder
                        to get some things...when you're in a weak position, you sound tough on
                        something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: I don't think I really have any hard idea about that. That was just as I
                    was beginning. The Panamanians clearly were probing all of us trying to
                    ascertain what was the best possible deal, as any negotiating group would
                    attempt to do. After many years of negotiating there comes a time where both
                    sides want something, and recognize that to delay further is to lose the
                    opportunity. I think I happened along at a time when both sides were disposed to
                    agree, and both sides recognized that the moment, if lost, would fail to yield
                    an agreement any time soon thereafter.</p>
                <p>Jumping ahead from the summer of '74 to the election of 1976, which brought
                    President Carter to power, the first whatever it was called then, NSDM-1
                    [National Security Decision Memorandum] concerned Panama. He was able to wrap up
                    the Panama negotiations in that period from January of '77 to August of '77,
                    because he accepted all that had gone before in the process initiated by
                    Ambassador Bunker. And he, President Carter, named Sol Linowitz as co-negotiator
                    with Bunker. But Linowitz never was ratified in his appointment by the Senate.
                    He took a six month job. The Panamanians realized that if they were going to
                    have something, it had to be done in that period of time.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came on board, as this is oral history, was there
                        a good historical or documentary record of how the negotiations had gone on.
                        Sometimes you start these things and it's a new team and they almost start
                        from the beginning. Did you have a feeling of historic sense what points had
                        been worked out? I'm talking about both your team and the Panamanian
                        team.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: On the U.S. team I should say that there had been a retired colonel at
                    State whose position really I took. He was a member of the Anderson team, and
                    before joining the Anderson team he had been involved on the staff here in
                    Washington of the Secretary of the Army in his capacity of overseeing the
                    activities of the governor. And this man had also been the executive secretary
                    of a presidential commission established by President Johnson in 1964 to study
                    with Panama where to build a sea level canal. Johnson essentially decided there
                    was going to be a sea level canal, the only question was how much is it going to
                    cost, and where were we going to build it. Well, this man whose place I took,
                    had held that job. There were extensive records of those various activities
                    available. This particular man though his personal contacts, I guess, and his
                    personal philosophy were somewhat out of synch with the thoughts of Ambassador
                    Bunker and Ambassador Bunker's deputy, so he chose after many years to return to
                    private life. And his departure created this opening which they filled by
                    bringing me in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't want to push this, but out of synch, was there a
                        real philosophical problem about what we're going to do. Could you
                        explain?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: He was a personal friend. He is now dead. I think it's a case of someone
                    being used to one way of doing things, and not quite adjusting to the new way.
                    And sometimes, I certainly have experienced it, and I think you probably have,
                    where there's a hold over sometimes they're somebody else's appointee. And that
                    works not always fairly to their disadvantage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically you were starting from the platform that already
                        had been built by previous negotiations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: Ambassador Bunker felt that it was a mistake, and it proved to be the
                    undoing of the earlier efforts to try to be too specific in some issues while
                    there were major conceptual differences outstanding in anything. And there was
                    always the problem of confidentiality, premature leaks. He tried to identify
                    these areas of common agreement, and then selectively to expand those areas of
                    agreement built around individual principles until we had a complete package.
                    The principles had been enunciated when I arrived, but it was the process of
                    identifying the issues, and then examining those issues and reaching conceptual
                    agreement on ways of addressing the issues. That process dominated the
                    negotiations from the spring of 1974 until President Carter was elected in
                    November of 1976. By that time we had conceptual agreement on maybe half of the
                    principles that had been identified by Kissinger and his Panamanian
                    counterpart.</p>
                <p>What was still outstanding was the whole problem of perpetuity, and duration. How
                    long is this treaty going to run? How are we going to provide for, if the
                    Panamanians don't like perpetuity, how are we going to guarantee protection of
                    U.S. interests for the indefinite future? And then what about the U.S. military
                    presence? What's the nature of the entity that's going to operate the Panama
                    Canal? And what is the economic area? We had discussed a lot of those things but
                    hadn't really agreed on those tough issues, particularly the problem of security
                    and duration. Sol Linowitz came in and took to himself primarily the issue of
                    perpetuity, I guess. He solved it by having two treaties, not one treaty, but
                    defining the near term in which the United States would first operate the canal
                    and then cease to operate it and turn it over to Panama lock, stock and barrel.
                    But concurrently have what came to be called the Neutrality Treaty, under which
                    we would have rights to protect the canal unilaterally, if ever we decided
                    unilaterally, that its security was threatened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Linowitz didn't get in until '77.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: That's right. Linowitz joined the effort in January of '77. He had a six
                    month assignment because his six months expired, maybe it was 180 days, the end
                    of January until early August. Linowitz is an international lawyer, very dynamic
                    person, very sure of his own thoughts, effective speaker, a good partner for
                    Ambassador Bunker, who by that time was 83 years old. He had high credibility,
                    high prestige, lots of integrity, and was very well respected by the
                    Panamanians. But they recognized that Linowitz had more of something than Bunker
                    had, which was political contact with the president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your role during this negotiation period work? You
                        said you were there more or less to keep the Pentagon on board. How did this
                        work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: My official position, I suppose, was as senior advisor to the
                    ambassador. After a year I also became the deputy director of the Office of
                    Panamanian Affairs replacing this AID officer. As I said earlier, some of my
                    military colleagues were skeptical. I retired as a colonel. Unlike some of my
                    military colleagues, when I took off my uniform, I became a member of the
                    Foreign Service. I was a member of State so my effectiveness had limits.</p>
                <p>Sometime, I think it was in the late summer of '75, George Brown, who by that
                    time was an Air Force general, was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He had been
                    the senior Air Force officer in Vietnam when Bunker was ambassador. Bunker had
                    close personal ties with most of the then members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
                    Zumwalt, chief of naval operations was the senior Navy person in Vietnam, Brown,
                    I forget who the Marine was, but I'm sure Ambassador Bunker had had an
                    association with him, and I forget when General Abrams came back from Vietnam,
                    but Ambassador Bunker and he were extremely close. Anyway, General Brown was
                    invited to Panama, he went down to visit the CINC or something, and he came back
                    having decided that he wanted his own person as a member of Ambassador Bunker's
                    team. He named a retired Army Lieutenant General, a three star general, who was
                    appointed as the co-deputy. So Bunker had from the fall of '75 until the end a
                    team in which he was the negotiator, he had a civilian deputy, he had a military
                    deputy, and I was the military advisor. My job, I would say, evolved to the
                    point where I became the executive secretary of the delegation, as well as an
                    advisor. But the Office of Panamanian Affairs served as the negotiating staff.
                    Position papers were prepared by our staff, and I worked very closely with the
                    deputy negotiator who also was the director of Panama affairs.</p>
                <p>We established something called the negotiators think tank that mirrored a little
                    bit the structure of the Panama Review Committee. People from the military,
                    people from the Army, the Canal Company, people from State, lawyers from both
                    sides. We would hash out issues and prepare issue papers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we stop at this point and I'd like to put on the
                        end where we are. When we come back we'll talk about the end of the treaty
                        negotiation. We'll talk about what were some of the sticking points just
                        before the end, any problems within our own delegation, and with the
                        Panamanians, any particular things. And then we will talk about the fight to
                        get it ratified, plus slightly back, but the role of Henry Kissinger after
                        he set down his general principles. Did he come into this or not? And then
                        also was the Cuban factor at all something that came up as we went through
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the 8th of August 1996. You want to do Kissinger, Cuba, sticking
                    points?</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: Yes, let's dispose of some of the issues that can be disposed of rather
                    quickly. I don't recall that Kissinger played any direct personal role after he
                    went to Panama in February of '74, the principal result of which was the
                    so-called Joint Statement of Principles which provided guidance for the treaty
                    negotiations through to their completion in '77. He certainly had an interest in
                    the course of the negotiations for as long as he remained in the government, and
                    Ambassador Bunker always had direct access and generally, my recollection is, he
                    could get from the Secretary what he wanted or needed at a particular moment.
                    But having set the stage for a reinvigorated negotiation, I think Secretary
                    Kissinger turned to other matters. At the time he was also quite involved in the
                    mid-East negotiations. Ambassador Bunker, besides being the chief negotiator for
                    the Panama business, was involved with Kissinger in the mid-East. And, in fact,
                    later in '74 it seems to me, Ambassador Bunker celebrated his 80th birthday as a
                    member of Kissinger's delegation during Kissinger's Tel Aviv-Cairo shuttle, or a
                    series of shuttles back and forth.</p>
                <p>Cuba was always a factor. We knew that Noriega, as the head of Torrijos's
                    intelligence effort, was a major intermediary, or liaison with Cuba, but my
                    recollection is that Cuba throughout the negotiations never really played any
                    direct role. In the final weeks of the negotiations in '77, after Sol Linowitz
                    joined the negotiating effort as a co-negotiator with Ellsworth Bunker under
                    Carter, there was a major effort to bring the major Latin American country
                    governments aboard — I guess we paid attention. But nothing really stands out in
                    my memory of Cuban involvement.</p>
                <p>The negotiations were concluded in '77 under President Carter within six months
                    of Carter taking office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it sort of generally agreed when Carter came in to
                        continue the course of not to mess around. This is such a domestic issue I
                        was wondering whether he let us get in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: We were able to conclude the negotiations because President Carter
                    bought everything that had gone before. I forget exactly how much we went into
                    this in earlier sessions, but the negotiations had been begun by Johnson back in
                    '64 with the support of the then living Presidents Hoover, Eisenhower, Truman,
                    and they were continued by Nixon, and then by Ford. They were able to be
                    concluded by Carter because he took everything that had gone before, and he
                    added at that point a vital impulse, perhaps, in the person of Sol Linowitz.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>The inaugural day, the first NSDM, this is in January of 1977, the first National
                    Security Decision Memorandum, the acronym for that administration, NSDM-1
                    concerned Panama, and it said go forward expeditiously, conclude a treaty if a
                    treaty can be concluded, as quickly as possible. In the period following the
                    election, and before the inaugural, there was a major internal effort to permit
                    that NSDM-1 to come into being. The shape of the negotiating team, the major
                    adjustment was that Ambassador Sol Linowitz who had been U.S. ambassador to the
                    OAS, and who was a major Democratic party figure, and with a fairly
                    long-standing interest in Latin America, prominent international lawyer, was
                    brought aboard as a co-negotiator with Ambassador Bunker. Ambassador Bunker by
                    that time was approaching his 84th birthday, 83rd birthday I guess. Although he
                    was a political appointee, had been a political appointee to numerous
                    presidents, he was not a career person but in fact he probably had spent longer
                    time at the State Department, and indeed as an ambassador, than almost any other
                    then living ambassador dealing with difficult matters. And he brought to his job
                    as chief negotiator from the time he was appointed by President Nixon in 1973,
                    his great measure of integrity, fair mindedness, evenhandedness. He always said
                    that he had to get the confidence of the Panamanians. Earlier, I think, I did
                    talk about his understanding early on of the absolute necessity to have U.S.
                    military support and I think I also talked about the trilateral nature of this
                    negotiation, negotiation with Panama obviously. A negotiation between State and
                    the military in a sense, and perhaps the most difficult negotiation of the
                    three, the negotiation in a sense with the American public, and particularly
                    after '77 the negotiation between the executive and the Congress, particularly
                    the Senate, in order to gain the Senate's approval.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Bunker brought great credentials to each of those efforts. But by
                    January 20th of 1977, the immediate crisis concerned the negotiation with
                    Panama, and particularly the then remaining issues of perpetuity, that
                    translated into duration — how long was the treaty going to run for — given the
                    opposing views by Panama and the United States. Panama wanting to recover its
                    sovereignty, self respect. And the American need for a measure of security
                    stretching beyond whatever period the treaty was to end. We were not prepared to
                    substitute no security for perpetuity. The issue of duration and the issue
                    especially of longer term security were the two major issues, I guess. Then we
                    had to decide who or what was going to operate the canal. Ambassador Linowitz
                    had a lot of political opposition. He declined to have his name submitted for
                    Senate confirmation. Instead he came aboard for six months. In effect, he was a
                    temporary government employee. That, however, created the impulse to fish or cut
                    bait. To conclude the treaties expeditiously.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>And he took to himself the whole problem of duration and security. And out of his
                    efforts primarily, emerged the final shape of the treaty package. Whereas until
                    then we had been thinking, I think, primarily about one treaty. We split it into
                    two parts and we developed what came to be the Panama Canal Treaty, which it was
                    agreed, would expire on December 31, 1999, now just slightly more than three
                    years away. And a companion treaty, a treaty covering the permanent neutrality
                    of the canal which gave to both parties the right, as subsequently elaborated
                    and indeed expanded on during the Senate debate on the treaty, the unilateral
                    right of the two parties to take whatever actions they deemed individually
                    appropriate, should they in their individual judgments conclude that the
                    neutrality of the canal, that is to say its security, were threatened.</p>
                <p>Those issues preoccupied the attention of the negotiating teams during the months
                    of February, March, April, May, early June. By early June those issues had been
                    pretty well resolved. What was also being addressed concurrently was a
                    so-called, form of the agency. Would it be a U.S. government agency? Would it be
                    an international agency? Would it be a bilateral agency? Would it be public?
                    Would it be private? The United States essentially having agreed with Panama on
                    the limited duration of the treaty governing the operation of the canal, namely,
                    that we would turn the canal over to Panama at the end of this century, the end
                    of 1999, predominated, and Panama agreed, that in the period from '77 until '99
                    that there would be established a United States government agency with corporate
                    form called the Panama Canal Commission that would have a full-time
                    administrator whose nationality would be U.S. until 1989, but thereafter whose
                    nationality would be Panamanian. Both individuals designated by the U.S.
                    president for confirmation by the U.S. Senate. But in the case of the Panamanian
                    administrator, he would be proposed by the government of Panama. The performance
                    of the administrator would be watched over by a bi-national board of directors
                    which would have a permanent, for the duration of the treaty, U.S. majority and
                    a Panamanian minority. And so by such compromises and blends we were able to put
                    together a treaty package. We assembled in Panama for a final major negotiating
                    session in early August of '77. It seems to me we made our announcement that we
                    had reached agreement on a treaty, that we would sign in early September of '77,
                    either on the 7th or 8th of August 1977.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say you came up with this formula for the
                        commission and how to do it. How was this arrived at?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: The manner of the negotiation underwent a significant change in those
                    final six months. I don't think I talked particularly in earlier sessions about
                    the way the negotiations were conducted from the time that I came aboard. I came
                    aboard first as a military advisor to Ambassador Bunker. By the end of the first
                    year certainly, I had in effect become the — using a military term — chief of
                    staff of the negotiating team, working under the chief negotiator, Ambassador
                    Bunker, and his civilian deputy, a man named Maury Bell, who was the director of
                    Panama Affairs. I was the deputy director. At the last session I also spoke
                    about after a year or so of my joining, the Defense Department insisting that
                    they bring in their own military deputy negotiator, a man named General Welborn
                    Dolvin, who is now dead unfortunately. He would have been a good person for you
                    to have gotten.</p>
                <p>In those early years, starting in '74, the negotiations typically were conducted
                    in a very informal manner. Most often in the early times they were conducted on
                    the island of Contadora, a small island in the Bay of Panama out 15-20 minutes
                    by air from Panama City, a part of the Pearl Island chain. It was an island that
                    was in the process of being developed as a resort for wealthy members of
                    Panamanian society. When we would land there sometimes at night we would be
                    guided in by flashlight. It was a gravel strip. We lived in trailers, another
                    time we used a small house. I can still remember one of the first times that I
                    went there. The outside of the house right along the living room there was a
                    small space between a walkway and the wall, they had put in plastic flowers. The
                    gardener each morning would water the plastic flowers.</p>
                <p>In any event, the sessions were very informal. Small in number, the chief
                    negotiator, the deputy negotiator, a lawyer from each side, just a half a dozen
                    and we would have a relatively formal session across a table such as we're
                    sitting at here. And then other conversations would take place informally over
                    lunch, or over cocktails, or in the evening. But we did this in order to be able
                    to talk in privacy, and be able to talk reasonably frankly away from the focus
                    of the media. And again given the nature of the negotiations that the domestic
                    influences on both sides were so strong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you ever sit together with some of your Panamanian
                        colleagues and say, we've got a mutual problem because the people we
                        represent, the public, won't buy this or that. And say, what if we try this?
                        I'm talking about the equivalent of a bull session. Sitting around and say,
                        do you think this might work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: We would, but in very small groupings. We would have the more or less
                    formal sessions which were, in comparison to later years, relatively informal.
                    Their chief negotiator was the former rector of their university, a man named
                    Rob [Panamanian name], prominent, leftist, lawyer now deceased. But he would
                    talk on at great length about Panama being so small, and so poor, and the United
                    States so large and powerful, and therefore we had the flexibility to change. We
                    had to understand that really they just couldn't...we had to put up with all
                    this. He would say that for the formal negotiating session and then privately he
                    would be much open. So there was a constant searching for ways of dealing with
                    really a common problem, but in ways that would solve the individual problems of
                    the two sides. Ambassador Bunker, to risk repeating myself but to do it
                    quickly...Ambassador Bunker's predecessor was Robert Anderson, Eisenhower's
                    Secretary of the Treasury, named by Johnson and then continued by Nixon. His
                    effort, as I understand it, was to work on individual issues, and to translate
                    whatever agreements we could reach into actual treaty language, and building a
                    treaty that way. Ambassador Bunker refused to allow any treaty language to be
                    negotiated, but instead we took the statement of principles, identified issues,
                    and then began to tackle those issues searching for common agreement deferring
                    the obvious sticking points until later, but gradually expanding these areas of
                    agreement into a common framework. It was only after we got fairly close that we
                    began to turn to actual treaty language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Sol Linowitz came in, did you catch a breath of the
                        political world? I'm not talking about maneuvering, but saying, that's fine
                        but I know the Senate, and I have to worry about Senator X, or something
                        like this. Did he bring more of a touch of the world where much of the
                        battle is going to have to be fought, than before or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: I said earlier that President Johnson, when he began the negotiations,
                    got the support of his predecessors, and that Nixon continued the negotiations.
                    And they moved forward, and President Carter when he came aboard accepted what
                    they had done, and then concluded with the difficult issues. Whether or not
                    President Carter's decisions with regard to duration and neutrality would have
                    received the acceptance of all those people who had been involved
                    before...whether he was able to conclude agreements not just by accepting what
                    had gone before, but by altering the U.S. position, I'm not able to say. We
                    wanted to use the canal. That was sort of the bedrock of our rationale. We
                    didn't care whether we owned the canal, or whether we did it in perpetuity, we
                    wanted to use the canal. And our use of the canal had evolved considerably over
                    the years to the point where in the '70s our naval ships were not using it,
                    aircraft carriers were too big, nuclear submarines not surfacing. So the canal's
                    importance had dwindled, still very important, but no longer vital. That kind of
                    debate, I guess, that's important in military terms. I don't remember that there
                    was any significantly changed emphasis after Ambassador Linowitz came aboard.
                    Ambassador Bunker always maintained close contacts on the Hill, as they both did
                    once Ambassador Linowitz came aboard.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it go when all of a sudden you started to put
                        treaty language in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: In addition to all those key issues, there was one issue we generally
                    called, the lands and waters. That is, who keeps what, and under what
                    conditions. Not only was there the canal treaty which will expire in '99, and
                    the neutrality treaty which goes on in perpetuity so to speak, but there were a
                    whole host of side agreements. The most important probably being the SOFA,
                    status of forces agreement. That, of course, like other SOFAs around the world
                    establishes the conditions and the rules for our military continuing to be in
                    Panama. That figured prominently later in the crisis with Noriega. But an
                    attachment, or an appendix, a major part of that agreement was a map of the then
                    Canal Zone which under the terms of the treaty disappeared, and was replaced by
                    a series of military facilities, and a series of Panama Canal Commission
                    controlled facilities. In one respect, we gave away our rights as if we were the
                    sovereign, but at the same time, with the other hand, we got, either through a
                    SOFA or through a companion agreement, consensus governing the Canal
                    Commission's control of its facilities. The same fundamental rights but dressed
                    in language that was more acceptable to an age concerned with nationalism.</p>
                <p>One of the major items of unfinished business at the beginning of August of 1977
                    was the identification of the lines and boundaries for the various previously
                    solely U.S. controlled facilities, be they military or Canal Commission. Again,
                    I don't remember all the details of those final hectic days, but we sort of
                    patched an agreement together, and the chief negotiators, Bunker and Linowitz
                    and Escobar announced at a joint press conference that the two sides had reached
                    agreement and that there was going to be a signing. And we returned either that
                    same day or the next day to the United States. The President at the White House
                    had sent down an airplane for us. The date for the signing of the treaties was
                    eventually placed, I think, September 6th or 7th, in Washington at the
                    Organization of American States before all the presidents assembled there.</p>
                <p>But we quickly learned that there was a lot of unfinished business and in those
                    three weeks, or three and a half weeks, we really had to take the maps and
                    completely go over them block by block, street by street, facility by facility.
                    We had to put together an agreement outlining the disposition of military
                    facilities. The key part of the agreement was that the U.S. military forces
                    would leave at the end of the treaty period, December 31, 1999, unless otherwise
                    agreed. There is a strong popular sentiment in Panama today for a continued U.S.
                    military presence in Panama. There's a very vocal politically important group
                    which is opposing the withdrawal we negotiated. As we speak in the summer of '96
                    and in the midst of a time when our military is significantly drawing down in
                    size, and when our military plans are in five year increments, our military
                    planners are already beyond the point where they are expecting to keep any
                    military in Panama. Not that if there were to be a political agreement, they
                    could not make adjustment. But that all had to be worked out in the period after
                    agreement was announced.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Up until the spring of '77 we had no draft treaty language. We had two young
                    lawyers who were very involved in the negotiating efforts, a man named Michael
                    Kozak who just left last week to be our number one person in Havana; and a young
                    Harvard educated woman lawyer named Geraldine [last name unknown]. They began
                    work on a draft treaty and it happened that Gerry was expecting. Her
                    instructions were, don't have this baby until you've concluded the draft treaty.
                    She finished the draft treaty about 5:00 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon,
                    delivered her baby girl less than 12 hours later. But that was in keeping with
                    Ambassador Bunker's approach to concentrate on conceptual agreement, and than
                    gradually to expand that agreement and only when we thought we were reasonably
                    close should we go to the treaty negotiations.</p>
                <p>In contrast to the informal sessions primarily held on Contadora Island, '74,
                    '75, '76, a period that began with President Nixon and followed through under
                    President Ford. The pace of the negotiations was very much influenced by the
                    political debate back in the United States. When I first came aboard, Ambassador
                    Bunker, having been with both President Nixon and later President Ford, and
                    working with Secretary Kissinger, a theme in '74 was, go slow in '74, expedite
                    in '75, '74 Congressional elections. We worked pretty hard in '75. There was a
                    lot of hostility in the country to the negotiations back in those days.
                    Eventually in '77 it was front page news for quite a period of time. Typically
                    New Yorker had a cartoon, two men standing at a bar, a 19th hole man saying, I
                    had gone for so many years without thinking about the Panama Canal, and now
                    suddenly I find I cannot live without it. Time magazine had a cover, Uncle Sam
                    sitting in the middle of the canal waist deep, and the question, how did he get
                    out of it?</p>
                <p>The shape of the negotiations '74, very informal, very small, mostly Contadora.
                    '75 and '76 it somewhat expanded in size, but still rather informal, principally
                    held at Contadora, but occasionally in Washington, Airlie House. But then by
                    '77, six months to go, the clock is ticking, let's do it or get on to other
                    things. The first major negotiation was held on Contadora. It was pretty much of
                    a disaster. Large negotiating team on the Panamanian side, we were subjected to
                    a bit of Khrushchev-style shoe thumping, by one of their lawyers whose cousin
                    just left from here a couple of weeks ago, having served successfully as
                    Panama's ambassador to the United States, now Panama's foreign minister. A very
                    prominent lawyer in his own right.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Sol Linowitz, I think, said, I won't go back to Contadora, this is not the way to
                    finish the negotiations. There were some internal stresses developing within the
                    American team, generated, I guess, because of Linowitz's emergence as a dominant
                    player. And the negotiating team shifted primarily to Washington. There was a
                    major negotiating session which occurred in March, was held at the Panamanian
                    embassy, everything recorded. Nothing had been up until that point. It dealt
                    primarily with the neutrality issue that I've talked about, duration, a
                    relatively short duration. But then in early May we began a negotiating round
                    which went all week long, or two and a half-three weeks, and the Panamanians
                    adjourned to go to Panama City for instructions. That was conducted in the
                    Secretary's or the Deputy Secretary's conference room on the 7th floor just a
                    few steps from the Deputy Secretary's office with everything taped, and we have
                    in the State Department the transcripts of those negotiating sessions. I think
                    the negotiations were limited to six-seven people on a side, Ambassador Bunker,
                    Linowitz, Tom Dolvin, a military deputy, Morey Bell the State deputy, myself,
                    and probably at least one lawyer. We essentially broke the back of the
                    unresolved major issues at that point, and we agreed to have one final session
                    in Panama at the Holiday Inn in Panama City, and that was when the agreement was
                    announced. We came back to Washington, we had joint teams then working on the
                    treaties, and all the side agreements, and we put them together. I had to go
                    back to Panama for maybe two or three weeks to deal with some of these lands and
                    waters issues, that is what the treaty said about military structure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had Tom Dolvin, I would imagine lands and waters
                        would...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: That was an issue of major interest to him, a primary interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it what I would imagine that you might say the State
                        and civilian side was not as interested in some of the lands and waters, and
                        the Pentagon being much more interested, and was this a point of heavy
                        discussion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: I guess that on the State side there was periodic frustration at the
                    excessive focus on some of the details. Tom Dolvin, a credit to him and I think
                    a credit to Ellsworth Bunker, and his collective bosses, namely the Joint Chiefs
                    of State, Tom would periodically...you're familiar I suppose in a general sense
                    with how the Joint Chiefs conduct their business. Tom would go into what they
                    called the tank, and meet personally with the chiefs for a report on the course
                    of the negotiations. And during '77 he did that with some regularity. I don't
                    remember the language of the NSDM-1, but I don't think it came as a surprise. I
                    don't recall that it was a surprise to Defense. I would assume that they were
                    engaged before January 20 in its drafting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see a solid progression of all the work you'd done
                        to the final treaty? Or were there, you might say, surprise provisions or
                        anything else, things that had to be worked out at the very last.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: In 1967 one of the then three treaties dealt with a sea level canal
                    treaty. By 1977, even as early as '74 when I first came aboard, the whole idea
                    of the practicality of a sea level canal had been largely removed. We dealt with
                    that question by a short article in the treaty, and that article was negotiated.
                    One Saturday morning we assembled in Ambassador Bunker's office on the 7th
                    floor. Ambassador Linowitz had a small office adjacent to his, and there were
                    some overseas calls primarily with Linowitz on the line, talking, I think, to
                    Torrijos who was at that point visiting in Bogota, and with President Carter or
                    somebody in the White House with President Carter's ear. They wrote that article
                    of the treaty in the course of those telephone conversations that day. But it
                    wasn't important.</p>
                <p>As I say, aside from the question of whether some of President Carter's
                    predecessors would have judged the terms of the duration, and the security
                    provisions, to be too generous, instead of negotiations perpetually pursued. By
                    and large, I'm not aware that there were major differences institutionally as we
                    worked through the process. Not to say there were not differences, but no great
                    surprises. The Joint Chiefs, George Brown and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
                    having served as the head of the U.S. Air Force in Vietnam when Bunker was
                    ambassador, and Abrams who was in the Army Chiefs of Staff who had served with
                    Bunker, and Zumwalt. If Bunker said we needed a treaty, he had their support.
                    That was key.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't have the usual thing of the military, to use
                        diplomatic terms, pissing all over things after a treaty had been done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: We did not have the problems that we did develop with the military in
                    1988 during the Noriega crisis, when the then chairman, Admiral Crowe, didn't
                    like the policy being pursued by State, and as I recall, with the endorsement of
                    President Reagan, and you'd read about it in the New York Times. There was a lot
                    of unpleasantness and that whole matter didn't get resolved until President Bush
                    came into office and the military and the State Department mutually worked out
                    their differences diplomatically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The treaty was signed then in September of...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: The treaty was signed in early September of 1977 at a large formal
                    ceremony. President Carter, General Torrijos, and most of the Latin American
                    presidents. There was a Contadora group by that time, Mexico, Venezuela and
                    Columbia. Those presidents were present. Later in September the draft treaties
                    were submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent, and there followed a
                    period of six months in which we tried very hard to win the support of the
                    Senate, and we engaged in an extensive public affairs effort to blunt popular
                    opposition to the treaty package. I, for example, spoke in half of the states in
                    the union. I spoke in 26 different states over that period of time, giving
                    speeches, meeting with different groups. Ambassador Bunker would speak in
                    different places, Linowitz...there was a citizens group established under
                    typically the way those things work. Senator Gale McGee of Wyoming was involved,
                    and we sort of branched out; and citizens groups coming into the White House,
                    Panama would always be a part of their standard fare.</p>
                <p>I found that typically Rotary groups, college groups, differed in extent of
                    opposition. The local civic groups by and large were against it because their
                    generation grew up with the canal, and we really felt, it's ours by God. We
                    built it, we paid for it, why should we give it away. That was a popular theme.
                    Eventually President Reagan, then Governor Reagan, was a major opponent. Once
                    the treaties were concluded, as I recall, he didn't join in the opposition. He
                    was very much an opponent in the primary period when he was challenging
                    President Ford. He made it a bigger issue than it had been. But once the
                    treaties were concluded, he backed away, and the major opponents within the
                    Senate were Senators Strom Thurman and Senator Jesse Helms, and a group of very
                    hostile opposition within the House.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, the House wasn't key to the ratification of the treaty. The House
                    had to be assuaged the following year when we had to get implementing
                    legislation. But in late '77, early '78, the focus was on the Senate. The focus
                    was trying to win popular support. We never succeeded with the American public
                    at large in getting a preponderant of support. I'm not sure what the present
                    administration would do, although they would probably say they did it in case of
                    an accident. But we were successful by the narrowest of margins in the Senate.
                    The Senate voted its support for ratification of the treaties in April of '78 by
                    a one vote margin. That was after an extensive debate. Panama ratified the
                    treaties for its part in October of '77. There were various amendments designed
                    to clarify the terms of the neutrality treaty, and the rights of the United
                    States under the neutrality treaty to send military forces back in if we judged
                    that necessary.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>There was one issue I have not said anything about that did figure very
                    prominently in the spring '77 talks, and that dealt with how much money Panama
                    got. Under the then treaty the annuity that Panama was supposed to get had risen
                    in value, I think, to 2.3 or 2.7 million dollars, some really rather small
                    amount. Panama had long ago sold that to some bank so that every year when it
                    came due for us to pay it, we never sent it to Panama, we sent it to some New
                    York bank which had loaned the payment to Panama earlier. Panama started the
                    negotiations with some outrageous amount of money that they wanted. But we
                    eventually settled on a package the details of which dim in my memory today. But
                    at the time of the treaty ratification debate in the Senate we felt that we were
                    most vulnerable to attack on economic terms. But interestingly, in what is
                    essentially a political debate, the opponents never picked up on the economics.
                    I guess because economic issues are so hard to grasp, to understand, and to get
                    emotional about.</p>
                <p>Then after the victory in the Senate in the spring of '78, attention shifted to
                    steps necessary to implement the treaties which were scheduled to go into effect
                    on October 1, 1979. We then worked with congressional committees, both in the
                    Senate and the House, to fashion draft implementing legislation. The Carter
                    administration submitted that implementing legislation to the House Merchant
                    Marine and Fisheries Committee, controlled then I think by a West Point
                    classmate of mine, Jack Murphy, who subsequently had to resign during a scandal.
                    The House wrote its own legislative package. It was one of those dead on arrival
                    situations that have come into vogue in recent years. But we worked out those
                    details for over the period of a year and a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were full-time Panama. Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: During this period I was full-time Panama. I came in as an O-2 and was
                    promoted to O-1 [Foreign Service officer class 1], by the spring of '79.
                    Speaking out of a personal note, my five year appointment was due to expire, and
                    President Carter's SES, senior executive service, came into being so I shifted
                    from being an FS-1 into the Senior Executive Service. At that point I had no
                    expectation of staying on for as long as I did, but there was no expectation
                    that I was going to go abroad, so SES seemed to be a more appropriate area. I
                    was at that point the deputy. In August of '77, after the negotiations had been
                    concluded, the civilian deputy, the office director for Panama, Morey Bell,
                    left. There were differences between him and Sol Linowitz.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>By that time Linowitz's six months were up, and while he continued to testify
                    before the Senate, and worked sort of informally, his days in the government
                    were over. He went back to his private law practice. David Popper was named as
                    Ambassador Bunker's deputy. His focus turned to getting the treaties ratified,
                    and then to the implementing legislation. I forget just when it was that
                    Ambassador Bunker retired, probably the following spring right after the
                    treaties were ratified and signed. There was a big signing ceremony in Panama.
                    President Carter went down to sign the treaties, Ambassador Bunker, Ambassador
                    Linowitz, a group of people were there. Then Ambassador Bunker, as I recall,
                    left, and Ambassador Popper took on the title of special assistant to the
                    Secretary of State for Panama Treaty Affairs. This was in the summer of
                    '78...exactly when he got that, I'm not sure. But in any event, he worked
                    directly for the Secretary until probably the beginning of 1980, I would guess.
                    I was named as his deputy, and at the same time I was the acting director of
                    Panama affairs until the spring of 1978 when a career Foreign Service officer, a
                    man named Jim Haahr, I don't know where he had been, but he was named the
                    director of Panama affairs, and he stayed from 1978 until he retired in the
                    spring of 1980 at which point I then was in charge of Panama affairs until I
                    retired in 1990.</p>
                <p>There were some organizational shifts during that time. For a short time around
                    1982 Panama was folded into the Office of Central America Affairs, and then it
                    was separated again by late 1982. In any event, by 1984 we were back under the
                    Office of Central American Affairs, but popped back out again as the Office of
                    Panamanian Affairs in mid-1984 during which I was office director. I had the
                    unusual position, or opportunity to be involved with one country's affairs for
                    16 years, and the last ten years I was in charge of Panama affairs.</p>

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: Treaty implementation was really the name of the game from the moment
                    the treaties were ratified through the drafting and passage of implementing
                    legislation, and for the first several years after the treaties entered into
                    force. We had to put into place the machinery called for by the treaties and the
                    agreements. The Canal Zone ceased to exist on September 30th of 1979. In its
                    place we had this new structure, the legal instrument was the SOFA [Status of
                    Forces Agreement], and the corresponding agreement that provided for the
                    facilities needed by the Panama Canal Commission. We had to appoint an American
                    administrator, a Panamanian deputy. The two governments had to name their
                    members of the board of directors of the Panama Canal Commission. Those nine
                    members...their appointment had to be consented to by the Senate. There were a
                    couple of other committees that were called for by the treaties, the senior of
                    which was something called a Consultative Committee. The concept behind the
                    Consultative Committee was that it was to be a high level diplomatic body that
                    was to be concerned with the treaty implementation in general. Whereas the
                    Panama Canal Commission's board of directors was to be concerned with the
                    operation of the canal. In fact, the Department of Defense, and the Department
                    of the Army, and the Panama Canal Commission were very jealous of the role of
                    the board of directors of the Panama Canal Commission. The Consultative
                    Committee, which came into being, had members named by both parties. It never
                    realized its potential primarily because of Defense opposition, you might even
                    call it jealousy, to sharing its influence with the Consultative Committee. And
                    there was a lack of any high level political effort within the United States and
                    the State Department particularly to assert the latent role that it had in the
                    Consultative Committee.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, the senior Panamanian member of the first Consultative Committee
                    is today Panama's president. David Popper was the senior U.S. member of the
                    first Consultative Committee. Tom Dolvin was a member. Then we brought in some
                    Defense designated member. There was considerable bureaucratic maneuvering by
                    Defense to derail the Consultative Committee, or to cause it to be stillborn,
                    and they were largely successful, leaving the field to the board of directors.
                    One of the big fights in the passage of implementing legislation was who would
                    be the U.S. members. It was eventually decided that, of course, the Secretary of
                    the Army was designated the executive agent of the Secretary of Defense for the
                    operation of the Panama canal, continuing a tradition that had existed from its
                    beginning. So the law said the Secretary of the Army, or his designee. And then
                    the law said a labor representative, a ports representative, and an engineer or
                    somebody with an engineer's background, I think. Then it was sort of silent
                    about who the fifth member was going to be, but there was a footnote in the
                    implementing legislation that somehow suggested it probably was going to be
                    somebody from the State Department. That for many years proved to be a source of
                    dispute within the administration. But there was a State member of the board,
                    David Popper initially, I think. Then when he left, a principal deputy assistant
                    secretary for Inter-American affairs whose name happened to be John Bushnell and
                    who had a good economic background came to the Consultative Committee. He was
                    very good. Again, in my role, I was a backbencher and would always attend all
                    these board meetings, but was not a member of the board.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>In fact, since the treaties entered into force, indeed since the negotiations
                    began in 1964, we never had a problem. We never had a problem due to political
                    unrest as was so typically the case for the 10 or 15 years prior. So in that
                    regard the treaties have worked remarkably well. The treaties called for a joint
                    commission on the environment. Back in the '70s environmental issues were
                    becoming important, and the Sierra Club and similar groups, became
                    interested.</p>
                <p>So the joint commission on the environment was the third major committee with
                    members who required presidential appointment and Senatorial advice and consent.
                    Of the three committees the dominant one was the board of directors for the
                    Panama Canal Commission, and because you had a State member on the board, we
                    effected good coordination I would say within the executive branch, particularly
                    between State and Defense. At my level, I worked very closely with the Secretary
                    of the Panama Canal Commission who would put together the agenda and who was the
                    principal assistant to the chairman of the board.</p>
                <p>In Panama for many years, certainly going back to the time of President Johnson,
                    you had a U.S. group called the Panama Review Committee consisting of three
                    members: the Ambassador; the governor of the Canal Zone, president of the Canal
                    Commission as the second person; and then the senior military person, the
                    commander of the U.S. forces, Southern Command. They worked very closely in
                    Panama coordinating the range of issues of concern to the United States
                    government there. They would submit recommendations. And there was, in effect, a
                    group in Washington of comparable membership that existed from the time when I
                    joined State in '77. One of the first things that Ambassador Bunker did was to
                    establish what we termed a negotiators think tank. I chaired a group that
                    included the secretary of the Panama Canal Company. It was the predecessor to
                    the Canal Commission. Somebody from SOUTHCOM, and then other people from
                    agencies depending upon the issues. But we would sit down and we would take the
                    principles enunciated by the Tack-Kissinger agreement of February of '74, and
                    then the issues that emerged, and we would write position papers. But we didn't
                    have to submit them for inter-agency clearance. That process would come after
                    the ambassador decided that yes the product was worthy of formal coordination.
                    So we were able to escape the bureaucratic inertia that sometimes fixes itself
                    around existing positions. That kind of process continued in different forms all
                    through my experience. It proved to be effective.</p>

                    directors of the Panama Canal Commission. I'd like to describe a little bit the
                    Panamanian members. I'd like to talk a little bit about the interplay between
                    the U.S. administrator and the Panamanian deputy administrator. Some of the
                    things that were happening in the field of transportation that were affecting
                    our views of the relative importance of the canal, most particularly the
                    so-called land bridge which during the '80s had explosive growth while canal
                    traffic was relatively stable. And then the period of the political situation in
                    Panama, the U.S.-Panama relationship culminating particularly in the crisis that
                    began in '87, and resulted in the U.S. military action that ousted Noriega at
                    Christmas of 1989.</p>

                <p>WYROUGH: We want to look at implementation of the treaty beginning in October of
                    1979, up through the period in which I remained active, that is through
                    September of '90. And then briefly take a look at the political situation, the
                    broader bilateral relationship between U.S. and Panama in the '80s. The first
                    years of the decade were dominated by mutual efforts to implement the treaty,
                    and beginning really in 1984 and accelerating in '87 until we had the military
                    action in December of '89 which led to the removal of Noriega and the
                    establishment of a democratically elected civilian government free of the
                    military domination of the country which had existed from the late '60s.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>The activities of the Board of Directors of the Panama Canal Commission. The
                    Panama Canal Commission was, of course, a U.S. government agency established by
                    the treaties to oversee the operation of the canal through the life of the
                    treaty, that is, through December 31, 1999. The Board of Directors was a
                    bi-national body established to oversee the operation of a U.S. government
                    agency. It consisted at the establishment, and today and up until the end of the
                    treaty, of a nine member board, a permanent five member U.S. majority and a four
                    member Panamanian minority. All nine members appointed by the U.S. President
                    with the advice and consent of the Senate. In the case of the four Panamanians,
                    the nominations were to be on the recommendation of the government of Panama. By
                    law, the chairman was to be the Secretary of the Army, or his designee. Another
                    member was obligated to represent labor, a third to represent port activities,
                    and another to represent the maritime industry in general. The identity of the
                    fifth U.S. member was not specifically spelled out in the implementing
                    legislation, but the intent of the congress was mentioned in the legislative
                    history and it was clear to the State Department that the identity of the fifth
                    member was to be a diplomat, a representative of State.</p>
                <p>The Panamanian Canal Commission didn't fully buy on to that on the outset and it
                    required some effort by the White House in working by the Congress, but that was
                    the situation, that was the agreement. It was reached and it continued
                    throughout the decade of the '80s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem with the military to a State
                        Department representative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: I think it rested with the long history of essential autonomy of the
                    Army in the operation in the canal. They didn't really want their hands tied
                    anymore than custom mandated. We felt that the operation of the canal was the
                    center piece that affected the bilateral relationship, that it was absolutely
                    essential that the State Department have representation on this oversight body.
                    I forget whether in one of our earlier sessions whether I mentioned the concern
                    that Bob Sayre had when he was the United States ambassador to Panama. Back in
                    1970 I first was introduced to the Panama scene as a member of the staff of the
                    Secretary of Defense tasked with looking after that particular piece of real
                    estate, Mexico, Central America, of which Panama was a part. And I used to
                    attend inter-agency working group meetings where the ambassador would come up
                    and report. At that time Brandon Grove was the director of Panama affairs. He
                    was one of the more effective country directors among those I dealt with in
                    working with other agency representatives. He would get us together and Bob
                    Sayre would come into the room. Even though he was the president's personal
                    representative, responsible for bilateral relationship, the ambassador
                    complained that his authority effectively stopped at the border of the then
                    Canal Zone. He said that the governor of the Canal Zone, who was also president
                    of the Panama Canal Company, which was the precursor of the Panama Canal
                    Commission under the new treaty, effectively did pretty much as he wanted.</p>

                <p>There was established under the Johnson regime something called the Panama Review
                    Committee consisting of the ambassador, the governor, and the senior military
                    person, and they were charged with submitting recommendations to Washington as
                    to how the United States should conduct itself. So the ambassador never really
                    had the free hand, or never played as significant a role in Panama as was
                    customary in many other parts of the world. I think out of that recollection, we
                    at State were determined in the aftermath of the long period of negotiating the
                    treaty, and the difficult period of getting the treaty ratified, and then
                    getting the implementation legislation through the Congress, we wanted to be
                    sure that State's voice was considered in the policy that developed.</p>
                <p>That went well. The State Department representative was almost always, if not
                    always in my time, the principal deputy assistant secretary for Inter-American
                    affairs. Steve Bosworth, who retired relatively early in the 80s, I guess, to
                    take over the presidency of the Japan's Society was our first representative,
                    and then John Bushnell, who succeeded him, had it for a number of years. John
                    was particularly qualified because of his economic background. He was a very
                    good State representative.</p>
                <p>I attended throughout the period as essentially a back bencher. Our office
                    typically would prepare the briefing book for the State representative. The
                    chairman was attended by an individual who had the title of secretary of the
                    Panama Canal Commission, a full-time person, a retired Army colonel who had
                    offices here in Washington who had the job of preparing the agenda for each
                    board meeting. He worked closely on a continuing day-in and day-out basis with
                    the U.S. administrator, and his deputy, a Panamanian. He also worked very much
                    with the two committees of the congress who watched over Panama affairs; the
                    Armed Services Committee in the Senate, and the Panama Canal Subcommittee, a
                    part of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee in the House. He had an
                    extremely good relationship with both of those committees, and when the Panama
                    Canal Commission was interested in getting some small piece of legislation
                    through, he generally got what he, or the Canal Commission, wanted by working
                    with these two committees. He would prepare the briefing books for the U.S. and
                    the Panamanian members, and then with the two or three days that we would have
                    before the board would actually meet, my staff would prepare the State
                    Department view for the State Department representative, and then usually the
                    State Department representative and I would always caucus with the U.S. board
                    members, and brief them as they would get ready to enter the board meeting on
                    the state of the U.S. bilateral relationship. That became increasingly important
                    as the decade wore on, and as our bilateral relationship deteriorated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Initially within the first year or two after the
                        initiation of the treaty, was there the feeling that there was foot dragging
                        by, say, the American canal authorities. Was it being done with good
                        grace?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: I think that the U.S. members of the board carried out their mandate
                    within the spirit of the treaty. There was really no foot dragging. There were
                    significant doubts, and opposition, and some outright opposition I would say, in
                    some parts of what was known as the Zonian community. The American citizens who
                    operated the canal, who lived in Panama, and who had, many felt, a colonial
                    mentality, who were very much opposed to the effort to change the old canal
                    treaty. And when we actually concluded the negotiations in the summer of '77, we
                    went over and they were the first people to actually get a briefing, and there
                    was a lot of hostility. There was generally the thought that we had sold them
                    out. And that attitude never completely disappeared within that group, but they
                    were voted down and once the treaties entered into force, they did their very
                    best to...they acted in a professional matter, by and large. They did their job,
                    and we didn't really have any problem. I can say that we always defined the U.S.
                    interest in the canal as the interest in use of the canal, not in owning it, not
                    in operating it indefinitely, but in using it. From the time that Johnson first
                    entered into negotiations, right up until the present, to the best of my
                    knowledge, in contrast to the period prior to the mid-'60s, there was no
                    interference by the Panamanians, and no labor unrest that adversely affected the
                    operation of the canal, except for a brief time during the height of the Noriega
                    crisis in the late '80's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Panamanian board members? Were they
                        sensitive to the problems and obviously went through this of getting
                        accustomed to each other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: I would say that as far as the Panamanian board members, they were
                    always the minority. Some of them were extremely professional, completely
                    dedicated in a non-political way to providing the best possible canal operation.
                    There were others who were primarily political in their perception, and some of
                    them who had the bias , I suppose, of a highly nationalistic state approach to
                    affairs. Labor issues were important, became important in the early years of
                    treaty implementation.</p>
                <p>In a brief history, the canal employees, whether they were Panamanians or U.S.,
                    were paid a wage scale comparable to scales existing in the United States. There
                    was then a significant disparity as far as wage scales within the area that had
                    been the Panama Canal Zone in comparison to wage scales in the rest of Panama,
                    and in the rest of the Panamanian metropolitan area adjacent to the former Canal
                    Zone. The Panamanian board members were very vocal in defending this disparity
                    in the face of efforts, at least initially, to pay new hires a lower rate which
                    as you know in the United States today is an increasingly common practice. For
                    example, the paper today talks about labor negotiations in the auto industry.
                    The new hires are going to get a lot less, both in starting salary and in
                    pensions, and in all other benefits than the dwindling old timers have.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>The U.S. majority included a labor representative who was relatively sympathetic
                    to the views expressed by the Panamanian minority. In fact, he bought this
                    concept of a common salary scale, whether it be for new or old employees. That's
                    a situation that exists today, and it has reduced a little bit the relative
                    efficiency, the productivity, of the canal. I'll talk a little bit in a moment
                    about the land bridge, but I think it has affected relative efficiency. The
                    canal is efficient, but the productivity gains of the '80s and the '90s have
                    occurred more in the area of the land bridge, than they have with regard to
                    traffic moving through the canal.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, there was a U.S. majority, and while the Panamanian minority could
                    debate and delay, they really couldn't alter in any significant way a policy
                    direction if the U.S. majority decided in its individual private caucuses that
                    that was the way it wanted to go. Early on, the U.S. members decided that they
                    would vote pretty much as a block under the guidance established by the
                    chairman. They were not completely free. There was always the risk that one
                    member could break ranks and vote with the Panamanian minority, and so the
                    chairman of the Board, the Secretary of the Army's man, while he could direct
                    the vote, he chose not to exercise that prerogative in most cases. But it was
                    more a matter of discussion and consensual development of agreement within the
                    U.S. community that was the rule for the conduct of the Board meetings.</p>
                <p>The Board met, like most Boards, quarterly. Most often in Panama, usually once a
                    year in the United States. The meetings typically would take a couple of days,
                    maybe three days. The rest of the time the day to day operations were watched
                    over by the administrator and his deputy. The administrator for the first ten
                    years of the treaty was a U.S. official. His deputy was a Panamanian, again
                    proposed by Panama, nominated by our President, confirmed by the Senate. The
                    only American to hold the job as administrator was a man named Dennis McAuliffe
                    who was the last CINC of the U.S. Southern Command prior to the implementation
                    of the new treaty. That is to say, he was a three star general who retired on
                    September 30th of 1979, and was immediately appointed as the U.S. administrator
                    of the Panama Canal. So, while he wore civilian clothes, in fact the Canal
                    Commission maintained a semblance of his old Army flavoring. However, unlike his
                    predecessors who I believe were almost all Army Corps of Engineer officers, or
                    with an engineering background, McAuliffe, who was an artillery officer, had a
                    strong background in political-military affairs. By personality he was
                    thoughtful, and very reflective of the bilateral relationship. He was someone
                    with whom the Panamanians worked well, and who worked very well with the
                    ambassador, and with his own successor as the SOUTHCOM commander. He held that
                    job until, under the terms of the treaty, a Panamanian was named as the
                    administrator in 1989. His deputy was a political appointee, a popular
                    Panamanian by the name of Fernando Manfredo who remains active in Panamanian
                    politics today under the current Panamanian administration. Fernando Manfredo
                    was like his U.S. counterpart, McAuliffe, a person very attuned to the
                    viewpoints of the other members of the group, not just his Panamanian
                    colleagues. Highly respected by all U.S. officials with whom he came in contact.
                    Very well respected within the maritime community. Together they presented an
                    outstanding team for the period of the first ten years of the treaty.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A most crucial period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: They dealt well with labor problems within the Panama Canal Commission.
                    They worked well with the union leaders. One of the most influential Panamanians
                    to serve on the Board had a long background of working within the Panama canal
                    community. By the time the treaties entered into force, he was the president of
                    one of the two major canal unions, and I think shortly after that was elected as
                    the president of some international labor organization within the Latin America
                    area, a man named Lewis Anderson. He, like Manfredo, while he was a very
                    effective spokesman for his particular group, and for Panama, he also worked
                    very well with his American colleagues. I for one, whenever I would visit
                    Panama, and through that period I would usually visit Panama three-four-five
                    times a year, I would always make it a point to meet one-on-one both with Dennis
                    McAuliffe and with Lewis Anderson.</p>
                <p>The other Panamanian Board members I could describe at some length. Some of them
                    were purely political animals, some of them had no particular political
                    background, but were simply appointed for their various abilities, backgrounds.
                    They by and large presented a balanced team, and the two sides worked well most
                    of the time over that period of ten years. Except, again, when the relationship
                    between Panama under Noriega, and the United States deteriorated so badly,
                    particularly in the years and the months beginning with the firing by Noriega of
                    Panama's president Nicky Barletta in September of 1985. There was a period of
                    time where the Panamanian Board members simply chose not to attend the Board
                    meetings. That was a little rough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we tape the economic developments first and then
                        go into the story of Noriega, and what had happened before, and also any
                        reflections on Cuban activities, drug activities, or anything like
                        that.</hi>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: Economically, the canal continued to prosper during '80s. Traffic volume
                    measured in tonnage increased consistently over the period even when the number
                    of ships began to drop off in the early '80s as the economics of the auto
                    industry shifted from whole automobiles being imported into the United States in
                    favor of parts being shipped, and the Japanese developed their assembly lines
                    within the United States. The canal, by the time the treaties entered into
                    force, was no longer the vital artery that it had been perhaps during the First
                    and the Second World War. The military view was that it was an “important”
                    facility, not vital. The change in status reflected the change in composition of
                    our Navy. The fact that none of the carriers could go through the canal, the
                    fact that nuclear submarines would not go through the canal. More than anything
                    the canal has become a major maritime artery through which commodities move. In
                    the past 15 years or more, there has been an increasing move to containerization
                    as far as the global economy is concerned. The '80s saw a fantastic growth in
                    the so-called land bridge across the United States. While traffic through the
                    canal increased in a steady way, the increments were essentially small compared
                    to the growth in traffic of the land bridge which essentially was high value
                    containerized cargos moving from East Asia by a great circle route into the
                    major ports of the west coast, and then transshipped onto rail, and sent across
                    the United States stopping periodically to offload the containers that truck
                    traffic picked up. By the late '80s it was increasingly the norm that
                    containerized cargoes packed in East Asia bound for Amsterdam, let's say, could
                    move faster and more cheaply by way of the land bridge than through the canal.
                    This occurred because of technological developments on the rail lines within the
                    United States, double-decking the containers on the trains, and breakthroughs, I
                    suppose would be a fair term, as far as labor contracts that substantially
                    reduced, if not eliminated, feather-bedding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what feather-bedding is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: Feather-bedding being a reflection, I guess, of the time when you would
                    put a train crew on a train in Los Angeles eastward bound, and it would go 200
                    miles, or 300 miles, and be replaced by another crew. The technology had changed
                    so significantly that trains had the capacity to go much further without the
                    need for large crews or frequent changes to crews. So there were great savings
                    in labor costs, and there were technological developments that brought the cost
                    down of the land bridge in comparison to the more traditional all water route
                    through the canal which as I said a little while ago, were adversely affected in
                    my opinion by the high wage scales which the Panamanians insisted on
                    maintaining, and which the U.S. Board members went along with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had two more subjects you want to talk about with
                        regard to economic developments.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: I was talking just a moment ago about the land bridge and the fact that
                    technological developments were comparatively on the side of that traffic versus
                    canal traffic. On the U.S. side we were very conscious of this and tried
                    wherever we could to acquaint the Panamanians with these developments because
                    there appeared to us to be a tendency on their part to look at the canal as the
                    goose that lays the golden egg, and that the relative importance of the canal,
                    let's say in the '60s, would continue without substantial change. We warned them
                    wherever we could that, look at what else is happening in the world because
                    without change by the canal itself it could well be that you're going to end up
                    with something that is far less valuable than it was at one time, or that you
                    think it to be. So there developed the practice that whenever we would have a
                    Board meeting in the United States, instead of having it in Washington, we would
                    hold it in a major port city of the United States, both as a matter of public
                    relations between the Canal Commission and interested maritime groups within the
                    United States but also to afford the Panamanians the opportunity to be exposed
                    themselves to these developments. We would meet in Baltimore, Charleston, two or
                    three times in New Orleans, Houston, Los Angeles, we would go around the
                    country. It took the Panamanians a long time apparently to begin to focus on the
                    points that we were trying to make, with the exception of Fernando Manfredo, and
                    one or two other Panamanian Board members. There did not appear to be an
                    awareness or even a high interest in these developments.</p>
                <p>I, and others, encouraged them over the years of the '80s to begin to look ahead
                    to the end of the treaty, and to ask themselves how were they going to operate
                    the canal, what kind of institutions are they going to establish, what kind of
                    labor policies are they going to follow. What about modernization of the canal?
                    Broadly speaking, I guess, I was frustrated by a lack of real attention to those
                    longer term issues that we felt needed addressing. Now with only three years to
                    go before the transfer, I'm advised that finally the Panamanians are beginning
                    to look seriously at some of these issues which they have unfortunately, I
                    think, put off and procrastinated in favor of more immediate matters. There was,
                    of course, the delay in all of this caused by the Noriega business.</p>
                <p>The final economic subject concerns the alternatives to the Panama canal. The
                    treaties entered into force in October of 1979, and the canal treaty called for
                    the joint study by Panama and the United States of a...I don't know whether it
                    was alternatives to the canal, or the question of a sea level canal. This, in
                    contrast to the elaborately defined draft treaty that had been a package of the
                    aborted 1967 treaties that never went anywhere, reflecting the judgment reached
                    by a U.S. group called the Atlantic Pacific Inter-Oceanic Canal Study Commission
                    which published its findings I think in December of 1970, which in effect said a
                    sea level canal is simply too expensive, not economically feasible. Johnson, the
                    gregarious, optimistic soul that he was back in '64 when he had appointed this
                    commission concurrent with his decision to enter into negotiations, was
                    convinced that a sea level canal was going to happen, and it was just a question
                    of timing and cost, and where and such things. The attractiveness of that idea
                    had cooled and by the time we wrapped up our treaty it had fallen out of vogue,
                    and we simply agreed that we would study the issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>In March of 1980 President Carter, I guess, received the then Japanese foreign
                    minister, maybe the Japanese prime minister, I forget, but a high level Japanese
                    group, and one of the subjects that the Japanese wanted to talk about was a sea
                    level canal. And they were motivated apparently by a then elderly man, I think
                    his name was Nagano, who was an elder statesman industrialist. He was one of the
                    architects of the Japanese miracle, and he tended to look at economic issues in
                    global terms. A sea level canal across the Isthmus of Panama was one of a half
                    dozen projects that he felt were absolutely essential for the continuance of the
                    Japanese economic miracle. So he had sold the then Japanese government on that
                    idea, and they approached President Carter. We were still of the view based on
                    the 1970 study that it was impractical, not cost effective. We, however, began a
                    series of discussions that eventually led to our, we thought, satisfying our
                    treaty obligation with Panama to have a bilateral study and our interest in
                    maintaining a good relationship with Japan. We established a trilateral group
                    that beginning, I guess, in '82 and continuing into about mid-'84, drew up the
                    terms of reference for a trilateral study between the two major users of the
                    canal, Japan and the United States, and the territorial sovereign, Panama, to
                    study the relative merits of a sea level canal, or a third locks that would take
                    bigger ships than the existing locks, or a do nothing option, in effect
                    substituting the canal traffic with a transmission land bridge.</p>
                <p>We concluded those talks and the three governments signed an agreement in
                    September of '85 at the United Nations in New York. As a result there was a
                    commission established and that commission was supposed to be a five year
                    effort. By the time I left in September of '90 we had been interrupted because
                    of the Noriega crisis. The effort resumed and was concluded in the early '90s,
                    '93, '94, somewhat inconclusively because in the meantime traffic had not grown
                    through the canal at the rate that we had expected it would. Traffic projections
                    for the next 20 years, combined with channel widening efforts that the U.S.
                    began once the treaties entered into force in '79, supported the conclusion that
                    the existing canal could handle anticipated traffic up until the second decade
                    of the next century. In other words, I think the three parties agreed that we
                    would simply put off any decision.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting exercise though in trilateral efforts. Three different
                    approaches, melding three different points of view. An approach I'm sure
                    replicated now as we get more and more enmeshed in the global economy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does the Japanese meld into this already peculiar
                        organization?</hi>

                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: I was very involved in the effort. I was the senior American for the
                    years where we put together the mechanism that was going to undertake the study,
                    and then would meet on a regular basis. The Japanese were absolutely confounded
                    by the Panamanians. At one point, one of our very first meetings, we were
                    meeting in Panama at the foreign ministry and it happened to be the Emperor's
                    birthday, and the Panamanians allowed that, not very diplomatically, that they
                    were happy to have the Japanese participate, but that the Japanese should
                    understand that the U.S. and Panamanian involvement was in implementation of a
                    treaty requirement, whereas the Japanese involvement was just sort of a
                    protocol, or an executive agreement. In other words, the Panamanians were happy
                    to take the Japanese money but not necessarily expect that their views would
                    govern, or would be taken into account as much as the views of the Americans and
                    the Panamanians. Well, we got over that little to-do. The senior industrialist
                    statesman passed from the scene, and with his departure much of the Japanese
                    commitment to a sea level canal eroded. Not entirely, but in some measure. I
                    think all parties concerned have simply decided that there's no need for an
                    immediate decision. I was sympathetic to the minimal change idea, no sea level
                    canal, no third locks, maximum use of the existing canal supplemented by
                    non-maritime instruments be it a highway, a rail line, a slurry line, and taking
                    advantage of Panama's location.</p>
                <p>In fact, great circle routes are a little more effective through the United
                    States because of distances between Asia and Europe than they are between Asia
                    and Europe by way of the Panama Canal.</p>
                <p>Unless you have some questions...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't. Could you talk about the political
                        situation?</hi>

                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: Okay. The political life of Panama was dominated by their military from
                    the time there was a coup in the late '60s until the time of Operation Just
                    Cause in December of '89 when Noriega was removed from power. The strong man of
                    Panama was Omar Torrijos, a young colonel in the late '60s who came to power in
                    a coup. He controlled the country all during the period of the final
                    negotiations from '74 until '77. He was the head of the National Guard. There
                    was a civilian president, but the civilian president in fact was hand picked by
                    Torrijos. He was a Greek by the name of Demetrio Lakas, a big man, educated in
                    Texas, spoke with a Texas accent. Ellsworth Bunker, when we would go to Panama
                    for a negotiating session, liked to fish, and liked to sail, and President Lakas
                    would always make available his sailing ship, an old minesweeper perhaps from
                    the U.S. that Panama had somehow gotten at some point earlier. A good glad-hand
                    person, but with no effective political power. Political power was in the hands
                    of Torrijos who had a strong populous bent. He was killed in a helicopter crash
                    in the late '70s, maybe '79 or '80. There was a pecking order within the
                    Panamanian National Guard. By that time Noriega perhaps was the third or fourth
                    most important person, but upon Torrijos's demise his then deputy took control
                    of affairs. He lasted maybe a year or so, then his deputy, and then the next
                    deputy, and finally Noriega became the commander of the Guard. I don't remember
                    exactly, perhaps 1983-1984, in that neighborhood.</p>
                <p>Politically Torrijos hand-picked the successor to President Lakas, I believe in
                    the late '70s. A young man who had been one of the co-negotiators. When Bunker
                    was the chief U.S. negotiator, his counterpart was a man named Escobar Barletta,
                    a former president-rector of the University of Panama. When Sol Linowitz
                    appeared on the scene and became the U.S. co-chief negotiator, Torrijos
                    responded by naming this young Aristides Royo, as the co-negotiator with the man
                    who had been the chief negotiator. So those two teams remained in place through
                    the climatic session of '77. And sometime after '77, I don't remember now
                    exactly, perhaps in '78, Torrijos arranged that this young Royo, 38 or 39,
                    became Panama's president. And I think it was in that time period that he
                    promised that there would be in 1984 direct election of a Panamanian president
                    for the first time since the military had taken control of the country in the
                    late '60s. That schedule was maintained, and there were presidential elections
                    in May of 1984. The principal candidate of the non-government parties was a man
                    who by then was in his 80s, or late 70s, Arnulfo Arias, who had three times
                    before been elected president, and three times forced out of office by action of
                    the military. The last time being in the late '60s. And the candidate picked by
                    the military was a man named Ardito Barletta, who at that point was the vice
                    president of the World Bank for Latin America, U.S. educated, Ph.D. from the
                    University of Chicago, highly respected within the United States, and the
                    international financial community. Also a member of the Panamanian negotiating
                    team, so a good credential within Panama as far as the military and their
                    civilian supporters were concerned. As far as the PRD [Partido Revolucionario
                    Democratico or Revolutionary Democratic Party], which was the political party
                    established by first Torrijos, and later his military supporters to advance
                    their purposes.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>The election was a very close election. The election was challenged and Arias
                    lost by 1500 and some votes. He immediately challenged it. The United States had
                    no clear evidence, despite our suspicions, that the election had been stolen, or
                    fixed. So after a suitable interval we accepted the election of Barletta, who
                    was sworn in to office in October of 1984. Barletta was inaugurated with his two
                    vice presidential running mates in October of 1984. By that time Noriega was the
                    Guard commander, and was effectively running the country. Barletta proved to be
                    too independent for Noriega. While Barletta was in New York attending the United
                    Nations General Assembly session, and literally the day that he witnessed the
                    signing of this canal alternative study by Jorge Illueca, Panama's foreign
                    minister, and Japan's foreign minister, he got a call one night from Noriega
                    saying come home. And there had been a beheading of a National Guard civilian
                    critic, Dr. Hugo Spadafora, under rather grizzly circumstances. Again, the
                    details escape me, but Barletta appeared to be promising a truly independent
                    special prosecutor that was going to investigate the circumstances. Noriega
                    brought him home for consultations, and after an all night session, Barletta
                    resigned the following day, September 27,1985, in favor of his first vice
                    president, Eric Arturo Delvalle Henr�quez, who was sworn into office. This man
                    was a very successful businessman with sugar interests in Panama, wealthy,
                    interests in horse racing. But he was considered to be a traitor to his class.
                    During a parade in early October commemorating the revolution of the country, he
                    marched in the parade; and, in a display of civilian subornation to the
                    military, left the parade route to pay his respects to Noriega, and was
                    ridiculed by much of the opposition. That was in October of '85.</p>
                <p>The situation deteriorated gradually over the next couple of years. Delvalle
                    remained in office through '86, through '87, and then in late '87 there were a
                    couple of grand juries in the United States that began to look at the drug
                    activities, money laundering, of the National Guard and particularly of Noriega.
                    I remember in January of 1988 I was in Mexico for a brief holiday. We had been
                    apprised of these grand jury investigations in a general sort of way, but really
                    didn't expect anything to come of them. Lo and behold in late January of '88
                    there were two indictments returned against Noriega. Indictments which the
                    Reagan administration only learned about days before.</p>

                    by the time I left...I was caught by surprise. The administration was caught by
                    surprise with perhaps no more than a couple of weeks' warning. Delvalle was the
                    then Panamanian president — Arturo Delvalle. Elliott Abrams was the assistant
                    secretary for Latin America. Delvalle and Abrams met either in Panama or New
                    York, I forget which. Delvalle became convinced that Panama could not continue
                    with the head of the National Guard as an indicted person, and announced on a
                    taped TV appearance that he was relieving Noriega of his responsibilities as
                    head of the Guard. This taped appearance was broadcast one evening in
                    mid-February of 1988. That night Noriega convened the National Assembly in a
                    session about 2:00 o'clock the following morning. They impeached Delvalle, who
                    went into hiding. Noriega put in his own replacement president. Delvalle
                    remained in hiding inside Panama from February of '88 until I think the
                    following December, a period of about ten months. And it was in that period of
                    time that the civic crusade, or whatever they called themselves, were formed and
                    people began demonstrate in the streets, and we would have nothing to do with
                    the government established by Noriega. We continued to conduct our relations
                    with this fugitive president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have contact with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: We had contact with him. I would go to Panama, and I met with him. I'd
                    go to the ambassador's residence, and after supper get into the back of a
                    private civilian Jeep with the dark windows, and be taken into some apartment
                    building, change vehicles, and go into a private home and have sit-down for a
                    couple of hours of discussion with Delvalle. It was a bizarre time. For a period
                    of time, as I recall, Delvalle moved into our ambassador's residence, and then
                    moved into these different safe havens. There was a part of Panama with just a
                    series of high rise buildings...whether Noriega knew where he was and decided it
                    was just too risky to confront him directly, or what, I am not really sure. It's
                    hard for me to imagine that Noriega didn't know where he was, and chose instead
                    just to let him function in this odd way.</p>
                <p>We froze Panamanian assets within the United States. The embassy here in the
                    United States worked with the fugitive president, and we continued to carry on
                    with that man. We entered into an extended period that ran from February-March
                    of '88 through December of '89, a period of about 20 months. The situation
                    simply deteriorated. We imposed economic sanctions. The Panamanian Board
                    members, as I said earlier, boycotted the Board of Directors meetings. Our
                    embassy was reduced in strength. U.S. companies within Panama evacuated
                    dependents. Dependents of the embassy were evacuated, dependents of the military
                    living on the economy off the military bases were evacuated. It was a very tense
                    time.</p>

                <p>WYROUGH: Well, in the spring of '88 while we were working with President
                    Delvalle's shadow government, we were also holding direct negotiations with
                    Noriega's representatives, seeking a satisfactory solution that would involve
                    Noriega's stepping down from power. There was a major inter-agency effort within
                    Washington, State, Defense, the Joint Chiefs, the agency, Treasury, all the
                    usual players, plus the special ones because it was Panama. We looked at
                    different alternatives, by then the principal deputy at State was a man named
                    Mike Kozak, who had been our young lawyer who was one of the drafters of the
                    treaties. He had maintained good contacts, he was well respected, had good
                    credentials within Panama. He had a number of negotiation sessions. There was a
                    major debate within the United States government, the Defense Department, the
                    Joint Chiefs were very much opposed to military action at that point. We had a
                    CINC in Panama who was opposed to military action. The chairman of the Joint
                    Chiefs, I think, was Admiral Crowe who is now our ambassador in London. This
                    was, you remember now, this was now in the last six months of the Reagan
                    administration, and you would frequently read in the New York Times columns by
                    Elaine Sciolino, does that name ring a bell. She was a Times correspondent who
                    covered either Washington or the National Security desk at the Times Washington
                    bureau. She would have articles clearly getting information from Admiral Crowe,
                    or somebody in his office, lambasting the policy that the administration was
                    following and had been approved by the President, and was being pushed by State.
                    It was a disheartening situation. There was a time where we would have
                    inter-agency meetings almost on a daily basis.</p>
                <p>And by the summer of '88 the effort to encourage Noriega to leave voluntarily had
                    failed. The United States was then caught up in the presidential election
                    campaign. Things just drifted along, deteriorating gradually, but demonstrations
                    periodically and something of a stalemate. Once President Bush took office, the
                    Washington team began to work more harmoniously. We presented a series of
                    papers. There were just countless numbers of National Security Council meetings
                    and whatever the level immediately below the NSC was, the Under Secretary of
                    State for Political Affairs was our principal representative. Elliott Abrams had
                    left office, left his position and I forget now the name of the name of the man
                    had come in under Baker, a Democrat, a very capable, somewhat abrasive
                    individual [note: Bernard Aronson]. In Panama during much of '89 was one of the
                    major diplomatic issues facing the Administration.</p>
                <p>We prepared the NSC briefing papers; we prepared the briefing papers for the
                    meetings of the Under Secretary's committee; we prepared the papers that were
                    the principal papers considered by the IG [Inspector General] at the assistant
                    secretary-level meetings. And then pretty much on a daily basis for much of that
                    time we created an inter-agency working group that met in the offices each
                    morning of the principal deputy, an assistant secretary, a man named Mike Kozak,
                    who perhaps more than anybody else has been my closest associate at State, and
                    who is now our chief man down in Havana.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>The position that we took through all of this was that, given the nature of our
                    interests in Panama and the power of Noriega, there was no middle ground that
                    would allow us to continue to fulfill our responsibilities, protect U.S.
                    interests as broad as they were, and allow Noriega to remain in power. There
                    were initially critics of this approach within the military community primarily.
                    You have to remember that this crisis had its early beginnings with the
                    election, the first presidential election after the military had seized power in
                    the late '60s. In the last couple of years we had this bizarre
                    effort...eventually in late '88 President Delvalle left Panama and set up his
                    operation, such as it was, in Miami, and we would meet with him there. For a
                    while he would go back into Panama and leave and eventually disappear. But there
                    was another presidential election in May of '89, and this time the opposition
                    parties banned together, selected a candidate, not Arnulfo Arias, but his
                    principal deputy. The group, the Civic Crusade, I think it was called, composed
                    loosely of opposition parties. They formed a coalition and the head of the
                    Christian Democrats was the number two vice presidential candidate, and another
                    influential moderate political party, the head of it was put in as the first
                    vice president. And they fielded this ticket and they ran against Noriega's
                    slate.</p>
                <p>We chose to focus the glare of world publicity on the elections, and we did the
                    usual thing in order to send in international observers, and what have you.
                    Election time came, we sent in a presidential delegation, some Senators,
                    Congressmen, the usual mix. And they were met by our senior military man on the
                    ground who continued to have doubts about the course of action which Washington
                    was pursuing. Jimmy Carter headed his own team, as I recall, besides the
                    presidential team. The two teams sent observers to different places. Jimmy
                    Carter, as I recall, was shocked by the manipulations by Noriega. And in a
                    televised appearance Carter declared that the election was fraudulent, and that
                    the real winner was the opposition. The three successful candidates, the
                    presidential candidates, his two vice presidential candidates, then participated
                    in a victory parade down the streets of Panama, and were attacked by some of
                    Noriega's civilian thugs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the opposition group.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>WYROUGH: The opposition group had a victory parade and they were attacked by some
                    of Noriega's thugs. Whether they were military in civilian clothes, or whether
                    they were just civilian supporters, I don't know. They were bloodied, and their
                    picture was on the cover of Time magazine. Whether they went into hiding, or
                    whether they left the country — I think they left the country. That was in May
                    of '89. We tightened the embargo, the president replaced the senior U.S.
                    military commander on the ground, preparations for possible military action were
                    intensified. There was an attempted coup within the National Guard in October
                    that failed. And finally, by mid-December, a U.S. Navy officer and his wife, I
                    think, were somehow accosted on a street in Panama, and the decision was made to
                    send in our forces under what was called Operation Just Cause. Noriega was
                    caught literally with his pants down as the paratroopers dropped in to the
                    Torrijos airport. Noriega escaped with his red underwear and on Christmas Eve
                    actually took refuge in the residence of the Papal Nuncio, and eventually gave
                    himself up, I guess, early in January of 1990.</p>
                <p>I was a strong supporter of the action at the time, remained convinced that it
                    was the only practical course of action that the United States had left open to
                    it when all other alternatives, short of military action, had failed. The Arturo
                    Delvalle government, I was pretty sure, had gone to the United States, and then
                    was brought back into Panama. It was sworn into office, and a period of
                    reconstruction began in the1990s. The National Guard was disestablished in place
                    of a police force, and the United States provided fairly massive assistance of
                    various forms to help reestablish democracy in the country. The coalition which
                    was put together primarily in opposition to Noriega later had trouble
                    maintaining its unity, and in fact, fell apart. And in the elections of '95
                    their candidate lost...there were a number of candidates in the field at the
                    time instead of one, and the winner of that election was the present president
                    who had been a young Oligarch recruited by Torrijos back in the mid-'70s.
                    However, he was never a supporter or an ally of Noriega, and he really
                    challenged Noriega in the late '80s for control of the political party which had
                    been established by Torrijos.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As office director during this build up, before the
                        takeover by the U.S., what were you getting from our embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYROUGH: I would go into Panama, either individually or as part of a visiting
                    delegation. The frequency of my trips diminished given the nature of the crisis.
                    But we worked very, very closely with our ambassador. And indeed, in the final
                    months our ambassador came out, he was in Washington and operated out of my
                    office for months, and we had in Panama his DCM who was in effect the Charg�.
                    The embassy and we were of, I think, one mind. There was no divergence, and
                    eventually once Bush took office, the Pentagon with its several voices, and we,
                    began working very effectively together.</p>
