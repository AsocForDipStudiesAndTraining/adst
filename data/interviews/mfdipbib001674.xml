                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is 26 July, 2004. This is an interview with Stanley
                        Zuckerman. This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and Training, and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. You do go by
                        Stan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, to begin with, when and where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I was born in Brooklyn, New York September 7, 1933.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right in time for the depression.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I arrived with the depression and Hitler's rise to power. And
                    Roosevelt's as well, and only a couple of months before the end of prohibition,
                    an event my father used to say was the real secret to Roosevelt's
                    popularity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Stan, let's get a little bit about your background.
                        Starting first on your father's side. Where do the Zuckermans come from and
                        what do you know about them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I don't know a great deal about my forebears on either side. My
                    father's father and mother came from Hungary in about 1880. My grandfather came
                    first, and she arrived later. He was poor and ill and died young of lung
                    disease. His birth certificate indicates that his parents, Herman Zuckerman and
                    Tillie Richards, were also from Hungary. Unfortunately the census doesn't
                    indicate what city people are from. One of the things on my list to do is
                    discover more about my family history. On my mother's side, her parents on both
                    sides came from somewhere in Russia to New York from somewhere in the Russian
                    pale of settlement, I think around Minsk, now capital of Belarus.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Both families were Jewish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Jewish on both sides, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your grandparents doing, both sides as far as
                        they all settled in the New York area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: My father's father was described as a tinsmith. I think he was pretty
                    much a door to door peddler on the lower east side who would repair pots and
                    pans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He probably had scissors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Clicking scissors yes. He had some sort of cart. My father describes
                    the family as being very poor. His father died in his early 40's and my father
                    left school at the age of 15 or 16 to support the family. He described a
                    childhood in which he would fight other kids for lumps of coal that fell off the
                    East River barges when they were being unloaded onto trucks, sort of a
                    Dickensian youth. But somehow he made his way into the textile business. He was
                    never very successful as a salesman. My mother's side was more substantial. Her
                    father was a tailor who, I am told by uncles, was quite good at his trade. They
                    say the son wants to remember what the father wants to forget, and so I never
                    got much out of my parents, but I did get some out of collateral relatives.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>My mother's father, Meyer Rosenberg, was drafted into the Russian army, which
                    meant 25 years and very likely death before discharge. If you returned from it
                    you got a special seat in the synagogue near the Eastern wall. Fortunately he
                    was working in some sort of protected position with an officer for whom he
                    served as a batman and tailor. But the officer was transferred, my Uncle Al told
                    me, and my grandfather was sent to a Cossack regiment where they beat him
                    nightly for exercise. He decided to leave the Czar's army. His brother was going
                    to London. He gave him his money, stole a horse and left Russia. This may be
                    apocryphal, I don't know, but apparently there was a long trail from London to
                    South Africa to Mexico to New York, searching for his brother with his money. He
                    found his brother in New York, but the money was gone, but there he was in New
                    York. He got a position with one of the boutique department stores. I believe it
                    was either Henri Bendel or Bergdorf Goodman, one of those two. He raised a
                    family of five in some comfort. He then left New York City to go to Florida to
                    open a business in Jacksonville. The closest I have been able to determine as to
                    why he and his wife, my maternal grandmother Ida Blum, went to Jacksonville was
                    that my mother had a cousin named Celia Safer, and there was a Rabbi Safer in
                    Jacksonville as well as a substantial Safer family. That is probably why he and
                    his wife ended up there, opened a ladies' garment business, and made a living.
                    But he fell ilhe had diabetes — and wanted my mother, who was the oldest of five
                    children — two boys and three girls — to come with my father to run the
                    business. My mother was also in textile sales. But my father didn't want to
                    leave New York, which to him meant the known world, and so my mother's sister
                    and brother went down, took over the business, quarreled and split into a men's
                    wear store and a women's wear store, and both prospered. When my father died in
                    1962, my sister and I calculated that he had been outside of the city limits of
                    New York four times in his life of 72 years. He couldn't imagine why anyone
                    would want to be anywhere else at any time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where had your mother and father met?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: In New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the textile business essentially?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I really don't know how they met. They both were kids on the lower
                    east side. But as my maternal grandfather prospered, my mother's family moved
                    first to Harlem and then to the Bronx. A photo I have of her with a family
                    friend makes it look almost rural in those days. She began to teach at the Henry
                    Street Settlement on the lower East Side, teaching immigrant girls how to sew
                    and how to design. My parents must have met somewhere in that period and in that
                    place.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then what was it like growing up for you as a kid,
                        growing up in New York? Was it Brooklyn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes. In Brooklyn. It was a very nice place to grow up. We lived in the
                    south of the Borough, not far from Coney Island, in an area called Gravesend
                    Bay, which was within the Bensonhurst part of Brooklyn. We had an apartment on
                    the fifth floor of a six story building just two blocks from Lower New York Bay,
                    and I loved to watch from my parents' bedroom window the great ships passing
                    through the Bay on their way to Europthe Queen Mary, the Normandy, and others.
                    We lived on Bay Parkway, which was quite green, and the area was very heavily
                    made up of immigrant or first generation Jews and Italians. Before I left to
                    study in Wisconsin I thought that was all there were, Jews and Italians. Not
                    literally, but those were my friends. Our sports clubwe played basketball and
                    baseball — were a mixture of Jews and Italians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the mix go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: It worked pretty well. Emotionally I think, Jews and Italians are very
                    similar. But of course there were religious differences. I remember incidents of
                    anti Semitism. There was some difference, some economic difference, not total,
                    but the Jewish kids tended to come from lowemiddle or middle class families. The
                    Italian kids tended to come from working class families, probably because their
                    parents were more often immigrants. But most of my friends, Jewish or Italian,
                    went on to college and became businessmen or professionals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How Jewish were you in the home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: We were strongly identifying Jews, but not observant. On the High
                    Holidays, Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, and Yom Kippur, the Day of
                    Atonement, we went to the synagogue, but didn't attend weekly services. It was a
                    requirement that I be bar mitzvahed, the Jewish form of confirmation, which
                    traditionally meant you had attained manhood and could fully participate in the
                    weekly services. That meant going to Hebrew school every day for an hour after
                    going to public school, which was a serious encroachment on my free time. When
                    you were bar mitzvahed, once you were at the age of thirteen, and had gone
                    through the ceremony, gone through the studies that enabled you to recite the
                    prayers and make your parents proud of you, and have an enormous celebration in
                    your honor, nobody cared if you broke open another prayer book. Yet, the family
                    did not send me to a reform temple to study, because that was considered too
                    non-traditional since all the prayers were in English. It wasn't thought of as
                    being truly Jewish, since it lacked the traditional Hebrew prayers. And yet as
                    I've noted, their own observance was very relaxed, although all of the rituals
                    of life, of birth, of circumcision, of going through bar mitzvah, of marriage,
                    of death were observed. All of these were done in a religious context.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Hasidic sects, were they around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Not there, not in my part of Brooklyn, no. There were Hasidic
                    communities in other parts of Brooklyn, in Boro Park, near Williamsburg, and
                    later in the Ocean Parkway area, but they were rarely in view in Bensonhurst.
                    The only ones we saw were old men who would walk around in Hasidic dress with
                    rolled up newspapers crying out, “Buy old clothes.” They bought used clothing
                    and I have no idea what they did with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a family, did you have brothers and sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I had a sister who much later in life, after my parents had died,
                    discovered when she applied for a passport that she had been adopted. We pieced
                    together what had happened. My mother had developed diabetes in the gestational
                    period with my first sibling, and the baby was stillborn. My mother was an
                    extremely strong-willed woman, and we could imagine her saying, “I came here to
                    have a baby, and I am not leaving without one.” So she came home, and the story
                    was told to the neighbors that my sister, Myrna, was in an incubator. She was
                    very small at birth, and she would be in an incubator for a month or more before
                    she came home. Lo and behold a month and a half later, my mother brought home a
                    baby girl who my sister, before she died at too early an age, determined had
                    been borne by a nurse. The adoption was arranged by a doctor who may or may not
                    have been the father. The baby was born and delivered to my mother, and raised
                    with no distinction between the two of us, although she had blond hair and blue
                    eyes. But one of my mother's sisters was blond, and there were redheads as well
                    on both sides of the family. After she had discovered that she had been adopted,
                    we became closer than ever before, and remained so until her death. I remain
                    close to her children and grandchildren, who live in Dallas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what about family. What did you discuss around the
                        dinner table?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: My parents were not highly educated people but were very street wise..
                    In their generation, as children of immigrants, it was expected that you would
                    begin work after finishing the eighth grade. But they were very capable in
                    dealing with the world, particularly of the rough and tumble garment district of
                    New York, where they both worked. They were comparatively well informed. They
                    read several newspapers a day. It was a 45 minute subway ride to downtown
                    Manhattan, and the Times or Herald Tribune was morning reading and the New York
                    Post and Journal-American were brought home at night. I grew up in a household
                    where there were really two or three Gods. In addition to the one you worshipped
                    there was President Franklin Roosevelt and heavyweight champion Joe Louis. They
                    were sort of fixed stars, unmoving and immovable — permanent fixtures in our
                    lives. I remember being in Hebrew school on the afternoon that President
                    Roosevelt died. One member of the class was acting up and our teacher, a rather
                    stern woman, kicked him out of the class. She said, “Go stand on the street
                    corner until you learn how to behave,” and continued the class without him. Then
                    he burst in and said, “Everybody in the street is saying Roosevelt died.” The

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: They were very cynical about the Communists. Of course the Communists
                    were very active and the left was very active in the textile industry.</p>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I met David Dubinsky years later when I was a labor reporter for the
                    Milwaukee Journal. He always came out of AFL-CIO Executive Council meetings with
                    a fist full of theater tickets for the out of town reporters. My parents were
                    sales people and not unionized, but they supported the work the unions did in
                    improving conditions for the people who were involved in productiothe people who
                    sewed and pressed and depended on hourly wages. But they thought the Communists
                    sought to exploit them; they were outspokenly opposed to Vito Marcantonio, a
                    Communist congressman of that period. At one point I was sent to study Yiddish
                    in an organization called the Arbeiter Rink, The Workmen's Circle, which was a
                    Yiddish socialist institution. My parents didn't realize that. They thought I
                    should learn some Yiddish, but I think the fact that they took me out of the
                    school wasn't necessarily because they thought I would be indoctrinated, but
                    because the realized that it would endanger their privacy. Yiddish was their
                    private language that they used when they wanted to discuss things they didn't
                    want my sister and me to understand.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: There was political talk at times but of an elemental nature. They had
                    very fixed ideas about who was for the working man and who was for the Jews.
                    Despite what we now know about Roosevelt's resistance to Jewish immigration
                    before World War II and to bombing the rail lines leading to the death camps,
                    there was this feeling that Roosevelt protected the Jews, which was sort of the
                    touchstone of politics in New York.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Mrs. Roosevelt? Was she influential?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: She was not particularly influential at that point. I think her focus
                    was more on other problems in the country, on the conditions in the mines and of
                    the suffering in the countryside.</p>

                    constantly in the news. He would show up at every major fire. He was the perfect
                    political figure in New York City. His father was Italian and his mother was
                    Jewish, and he spoke Yiddish as well as he spoke Italian at political
                    rallies.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I was pretty good. We were very fortunate in those days. It was still
                    the depression, the latter days of the depression going into the recovery that
                    was induced by the war. The elementary school that I went to was run by Irish
                    ladies, most of them unmarried. They were very strict, but they were very warm.
                    I remember an incident that will give you a little flavor of the interplay
                    between the Jewish elementary school students and the Irish teachers. I had a
                    close friend who was on our team, the Panthers Social Athletic Club, Jordy
                    Berkowitz who became very successful in the advertising business in Miami. Jordy
                    was the class artist. The 5th grade teacher, a very nice Irish lady names Mrs.
                    Klages, asked him to draw a Christmas scene on the blackboard at the rear of the
                    classroom with pastel chalk. Over a period of several days, he created a
                    wonderful scene of a fireplace with a blazing fire in it and stockings and candy
                    canes hanging from the mantle. The teacher said, “Jordan, that is beautiful, but
                    it needs some holly.” Jordy went back to the blackboard and drew for awhile and
                    then stepped away to display what he had done. And all the Jewish kids burst out
                    laughing. The Italian kids and the Irish teacher looked perplexed because Jordy
                    had drawn loaves of bread. We pronounced Challah — the traditional twisted
                    loaves of Jewish bread made with eggs — “holly”, like the decorative plant. I
                    have never forgotten it. I do not see Jordy often, but there was a large high
                    school reunion in Florida I went to last year and everybody who had been in that
                    elementary school class remembered that story.</p>
                <p>I am in contact now, because of the internet, with some of the people I went to
                    school with as early as kindergarten. We went through school together through
                    elementary school and into junior high school, which was in a different
                    neighborhood and led us to broaden our social horizons. But our group still
                    stayed in touch even through high school. By the time we got to junior high
                    school, but to an even greater extent in high school, many of our teachers were
                    highly educated, a number of them Jewish, who had to compete against others with
                    MAs or even PhDs to get jobs teaching in the New York City school system during
                    the depression. My English teacher had a Ph.D. and was the editor of a number of
                    anthologies of short stories that were used in schools across the country. My
                    journalism teacher, who oversaw our work on the Lafayette News, the high school
                    weekly, published short stories in some leading magazines. In those days it was
                    possible to get a good education in the public schools of New York. There were
                    some tough kids in the schools but they were kept relatively isolated. They were
                    sort of put in corners by tough teachers who would put them in the back of the
                    room and knock their heads against the blackboard if they acted up. There
                    weren't large roving packs of gangs which intimidated other students in the
                    school. These days I understand that the high school I went to is a
                    battleground, with police on permanent duty in the cafeteria.</p>

                        your favorite subjects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I read very early. I think I read before I went to school. My sister
                    was a year or a year and a half ahead of me, and I read the books she brought
                    home along with her. I remember that somehow my father managed to register me a
                    little late in school the year after kindergarten. The classes were coded into
                    three divisions, with first grade separated into divisions 1, 2, and three, with
                    class one reserved for the kids who seemed, from whatever could be perceived
                    from their behavior in kindergarten, to be the brightest, class two for the
                    slowest kids, and class three for the average students. Because I was registered
                    late I was put in class two, with some tough kids, but moved into class one
                    because I could already read. I don't think it was an intellectual hot house by
                    any means, but there were bright kids in the class. Many of them did well, and
                    not necessarily the brightest ones. Some of the kids with whom I went to school,
                    particularly in high school, have done spectacularly well despite having been
                    very poor students. Larry King was Larry Zeiger when I knew him. I don't think
                    he ever really finished high school, but he may have. He showed up in one of the
                    yearbooks where there was a section for people who had to take extra courses and
                    finished after their class. But some did very well. Out of that mix of pretty
                    much first generation and second generation kids, out came lawyers and
                    accountants and professionals and scientists and businessmen of all sorts. One
                    thing they had was ambition; it was drummed into all of us that you had to go
                    further than your parents, who were working hard to try to give you an easier
                    and better life than their own.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: My first memories were of a series of books about twins from different
                    countrieMexican twins, Eskimo twins, French twins. They provided my introduction
                    to reading. Also, at one poinperhaps when I was a couple of years older, some
                    friends of the family gave me the first volume of an encyclopedia, covering the
                    letter A, which I read all the way through and decided I would become an
                    Anthropologist. But the war and the newspapers provided my introduction to
                    geography. I was very concentrated on the war, and followed its progress as
                    closely as I followed the progress, or lack thereof, of the Brooklyn Dodgers. I
                    could identify every plane in the U.S. Air Force when I was eight or nine.</p>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Every one of them, the twin-fuselaged P-38, the British Spitfire, the
                    Mustang. I loved them all, and, with little success, tried to assemble the
                    balsam wood models that came in kits. I was all thumbs and there was glue all
                    over my desk. We had a nursemaid, because my parents both worked, and New York
                    was overrun with young girls from the coal mining towns of Pennsylvania looking
                    for a way to stay alive by looking for live-in jobs. I don't know how we all
                    lived in a two bedroom apartment. There were my parents, my sister and I and
                    Marcia Kamerovsky from Nanty Glo, Pennsylvania, who was a wonderful woman. She
                    was only a young girl herself, but she took part in a big chunk of our
                    childhood. Her father had lost an arm in a mining accident and was on welfare.
                    Marcia listened to the battle for Moscow with us on the radio, and explained why
                    it was important. Before the war ended, her boyfriend was discharged from the
                    army. He was from Detroit, and she left to marry him and settled down there.
                    Afterwards we had a string of nursemaids, one of whom was a very strong German
                    woman who would listen to Hitler's speeches on a shortwave radio, and told me he
                    loved small children. I told my parents about that and she was out of the house
                    the next day. I remember exactly what I was doing on D-Day, and cheered on the
                    troops as if it were a football game as Europe was gradually liberated. Much of
                    my early reading was in photo books that depicted the suffering of children in
                    Eastern Europe, although the reality of the destruction of European Jewry was
                    not really known to us until much later in the war. When we saw the photos of
                    the death camps, it was an unforgettable shock.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well one of the things I think for all of us that get
                        ended up in the foreign service of that era was the fact that boy did we
                        learn geography. You knew where Guadalcanal was, Iwo Jima, El Alamein,
                        Rostov.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: That is exactly right. The map, the daily map of the front lines
                    depicting the point of our advance; it was like a football game. Football was
                    really some sort of metaphor for war because of that presence of a front line.
                    All of this was just terribly important to me. I remember I decided I wanted to
                    be an engineer because I reasoned that there was so much destruction that there
                    was going to be a need for a great deal of construction when the war was over.
                    My parents couldn't afford what I wanted, which was really an elaborate Erector
                    set. But a man living on our floor (we lived in a six-story apartment house),
                    was in critical condition and somehow we were able to take in members of the
                    family who had come to help. They were sleeping in our living room going through
                    this terrible thing. Then I believe the mother became sick and the father then
                    died, so it was an awful period for them. When they left, when it was all over,
                    they gave me this wonderful Erector set. I tried to follow the complicated
                    directions and put all of its many parts together, but discovered that whatever
                    my talents were, they were not in the field of mechanics. I had a friend named
                    Leonard Malamud who also wanted to be an engineer, so I invited him over to
                    help. And he put the most wonderful thing together, managing to get the
                    fractional electric motor the set came with to run the elaborate Ferris wheel he
                    had built. So, to my parents' horror, I gave him that expensive Erector set. I
                    decided I would be a journalist.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Lafayette High School in Brooklyn. It was a high school constructed
                    during the La Guardia period, down towards Coney Island, drawing students from
                    neighborhoods that were predominantly Jewish and others that were predominately
                    Italian, even though there was an overlap throughout both areas. The school was
                    surrounded by fields overgrown by weeds, although some were not as empty as
                    others. There were vegetable plots here and there, and marijuana growing in one
                    famous field. The school was fairly large, between two and three thousand
                    students. Because of the Italian kids, we had the best soccer team in New York
                    City. We always won the soccer championships. I was editor of the yearbook and
                    assistant editor of the newspaper, The Lafayette News. I wasn't a leading
                    scholar, but did well, well enough to get accepted into what was then a fairly
                    selective school, Brooklyn College, where acceptance depended not only on grades
                    and performance on the state-wide Regents exams, but also on the results of a
                    demanding entrance exam. But I had decided I really wanted to leave New York and
                    see something of the country other than what I saw on a few visits to relatives
                    in Florida and to upstate New York vacations.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Oh yes. Social life was organized at that time around what were called
                    “social-athletic clubs”. They were not gangs; we played basketball and softball,
                    sometimes in organized leagues. We played in both the YMCA and the Jewish
                    Community House, since our team was made up of both Italian and Jewish kids. And
                    we also had parties. For some reason we were considered a desirable bunch, so
                    after our team meetings in the apartment of one of the more cooperative parents,
                    we invited some of our female supporters to join us in a dancing party. So we
                    were socially active, but going steady didn't really occur until later, in high
                    school. The social athletic clubs were more a junior high school phenomenon that
                    carried over into high school.</p>

                        no go areas and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: No, not really, although we didn't really circulate outside of the
                    Bensonhurst area of Brooklyn, except to go to Ebbets Field to see the Dodgers
                    play, to Coney Island to swim or to Manhattan. Brooklyn's population was then
                    three million, and was the fourth largest city in the US before it became a
                    borough of New York City. Most people who live in Brooklyn know their corner of
                    Brooklyn and they know Manhattan. I don't know anyone who knew all of the
                    neighborhoods of Brooklyn. It was complex and ever-changing, and still is.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Coney Island? Did you get down there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Oh yes, all the time. My friends and I had a great routine during the
                    hot summer days. We had trolley cars then in New York, and the kids' fare was
                    three cents. It was perhaps 15 or 20 minutes from my house to Coney Island on
                    the trolley. As young as 10 or 11, we would get on a trolley car very early in
                    the morning, 7 a.m. or so, pay our three cents, get down to the beach, carrying
                    with us shopping bags. We would arrive before the beach was crowded, and began
                    to dig up soda pop bottles left over from the beach parties the day before and
                    not yet picked up by machines that gathered them. They earned us two cents a
                    bottle in deposits when we returned them to the boardwalk shops. We could gather
                    enough for a day at the beach, which included not just swimming in the ocean but
                    a Nathan's hot dog or hamburger or root beer or French fries, and a couple of
                    rides. If we overspent and didn't have the three cents to get back, we could
                    always tell a policeman that we had spent our money or lost it on the beach. He
                    would take us over to the trolley car and tell the conductor “take these kids
                    home”. Those days were wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember the large Canada Dry ginger ale bottles, five
                        cents. I used to go around the neighborhood and ring doorbells and ask.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: During the war of course, there were school projects. There weren't
                    many aluminum cans; most cans were made of tin. We collected them and turned
                    them in for the war effort. We were assured we were helping to beat Hitler. They
                    also had us weaving Afghan quilts in the classroom. We all had little square
                    metal looms, and we would sit there busily making five or six inch squares of
                    woven wool that were then assembled by some higher power into blankets. I don't
                    know where they were sent or what happened to them. But we really learned how to
                    weave, an important skill I haven't put to use in the past 60-odd years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what were you pointed toward? I mean was it accepted
                        at the time that you were going to go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Oh yes. Never any question. I think it was probably some time in
                    junior high school it became clear that writing was my real skill. I thought I
                    would be a sports writer. I loved sports. I followed baseball very closely. The
                    Brooklyn Dodgers were still alive and still one of the greatest baseball teams
                    of all time, not because of their record, but because of the intensity of
                    feeling for them by their fans. The day they left Brooklyn was traumatic. I was
                    not in Brooklyn any more, but I gave up following the scores. For a long time
                    after they stole away to California I simply divorced baseball. The owner of the
                    Dodgers who moved them to Los Angeles was Walter O'Malley. One of the New York
                    sportswriters, maybe it was Jimmy Cannon, wrote at the time that “the three
                    worst men of the 20th Century were Hitler, Stalin and Walter O'Malley.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see, the war was over. You were about 12, so a
                        couple of years later Israel was born. How did Israel play, and how about
                        the plight of the Jews. How much were you picking up about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The plight of the Jews became clear when the word started seeping out.
                    Everybody knew, of course, that the Nazi's despised the Jews and were oppressing
                    them, and New York City and Brooklyn were full of refugees who had gotten out of
                    Europe before it was too late, although the full scale of the Holocaust was not
                    apparent in the early years of the war. There were many refugees, not just
                    downtown, but even in my apartment house. These were people who left before the
                    war started, but who had lost contact with their families. I remember there was
                    a family that had come in the late 1920's whose sons were in the army. They
                    couldn't read the letters their sons sent them because they could read only
                    Yiddish. They would come and ask my mother to read the letter to them. As far as
                    Israel was concerned, our family wasn't Zionists, and had no intention of
                    emigrating. My parents were American born, so that the creation of Israel was
                    hailed as something that would help the survivors of the Holocaust. But nobody
                    in my extended family thought of emigrating to Israel. They were Americans.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I graduated early, at 16.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was '49?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: June of 1950.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '50. What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well I had already been accepted at Brooklyn College, but I had told
                    my parents that I wanted to study elsewhere and learn about another part of the
                    country. Oh I learned something about upstate New York because we used to summer
                    in the Catskill Mountains, in a town called Callicoon Center near the
                    Pennsylvania border, a tiny little town. We stayed at a farm that had been
                    converted into a small resort. Well it was still a working farm, but the wife of
                    the farmer had taken in some borders in their house and then they had built some
                    additional large cottages. They had taken a stream, a mud stream, and made a
                    concrete a pool out of it. The stream ran in one end and out the other. They
                    built a tennis court, and had rooms for about 70 people. The food was great;
                    fresh farm food and freshly picked berries for breakfast. An uncle of mine
                    discovered it. It was just a wonderful place. I spent every summer up there.
                    There was a man, I guess I was in junior high school or the first years of high
                    school, who I met who said, “Oh if you want to be a newspaperman you should go
                    to the University of Wisconsin.” Later, the family doctor spoke enthusiastically
                    about my decision, extolling the progressive history of the state. Knowing
                    little more than that about it, I absolutely decided I was going to go to the
                    University of Wisconsin, and I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well before we move on to that, you are talking about your
                        going in the Catskills. This of course was the heyday of the Borscht
                        circuit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes but this wasn't that kind of hotel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that, but I was wondering did you get in New York,
                        any chance to sample the wares of the theater or the other stuff that was
                        going on there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Oh yes. The great popular entertainment form in New York in those days
                    were the great movie theaters downtown — the Paramount, the Roxy, Loews, Radio
                    City Music Hall — and they presented a feature film and a stage show, featuring
                    some of the great entertainers of the dasuch well known artists as Frank Sinatra
                    or Louis Prima. My sister and I would get on the subway and meet my parents
                    downtown. (”Downtown” always meant Manhattan.) We would go to a restaurant and
                    then to one of these shows. It was a great evening out. We also sometimes went
                    to legitimate theater. I remember being taken to the Yiddish theater, although I
                    didn't understand it, when I was studying at the Yiddish Workmen's Circle, the
                    Second Avenue playhouse. I remember enjoying it enormously even though I could
                    figure out what was going on only by the action rather than the language</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was very hands-ish. Lots of, I mean the action was
                        pretty explicit wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes, except that some of these shows were quite complicated. I mean
                    there were things going on, emotional tensions between people I couldn't figure
                    out. I was sent to summer camp a couple of times, one of them a Jewish camp
                    where Zionist songs were sung, Yiddish was taught and Israel was very much on
                    their minds. But it didn't take.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the University of Wisconsin. You were there form '50
                        to '54?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What, I mean this is I guess sort of your first time away
                        from at least sort of in a different world wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Not exactly. We went to Florida a few times. We had family there. I
                    had two aunts and uncles in Jacksonville, so we were down there on several
                    occasions. Both journeys were from North to South and back. I can't remember
                    going westwards before I went to Wisconsin. I got on a train with a check for
                    $300 in my pocket, about $20 in cash and the name of a Jewish tailor in Madison,
                    Wisconsin, who would help Jewish boys find a place to live. I got off the train
                    and went there. He sent me to the house of a furrier, who lived a long walk from
                    the campus, and I stayed there during my freshman year for $5.00 a week.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the University of Wisconsin like in those
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well it was very interesting. It was much smaller than it is now.
                    There were 13,000 students. There were still a lot of prefabricated classrooms
                    and Quonset huts that were set up to receive the large number of veterans going
                    to school on the GI Bill.. I arrived in Madison on my 17th birthday but some of
                    the people in my class were 23, 24, 25. Many of the veterans were already in
                    graduate school, but even if you weren't in class with them you met them, and
                    you were exposed to people who weren't the kind of students you would see in
                    goofy films about “college days”. They were serious people who had become older
                    than their years, and they weren't wasting their time when they were preparing
                    for the future. They were not there to fool around. That gave it, I think, a
                    different atmosphere than it might have had, and I loved it. It was totally new
                    to me. I met people who were very different than those I had grown up with, even
                    though many were from New York or other places outside of Wisconsin. It had an
                    enormous effect on in my life. I came to spend, on and off, ten years in
                    Wisconsin, and still go back on vacations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what about, Wisconsin was sort of like a hotbed of
                        radicalism wasn't it. I mean it went quite far back.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: It was, compared to some places, a politically active campus, even
                    though the 1950's are characterized as a period of political indifference.
                    Madison was a rather “in your face” kind of liberalism. There were student
                    protests against compulsory participation in the Reserve Officer Training Corps,
                    and against Senator Joe McCarthy. I was the University editor of the Daily
                    Cardinal, and we put out a newspaper five days a week. I went up to the little
                    town of Sauk City with my roommate Richard Schickel, who became a noted movie
                    critic, to cover the Joe Must Go meeting, which was an attempt to recall Senator
                    Joe McCarthy. We were there to write about it, but a friend of ours who was a
                    stringer photographer for the United Press, said, “Hey I need a photo,” and he
                    handed us this Joe Must Go bumper sticker. He took the photo, and the next day
                    my sister called up. “What are you doing out there? What is happening to you?”
                    The photo had appeared on the front page of the New York Daily News, at the time
                    a Republican newspaper, and my family thought I'd stuck my neck out too far. So
                    the 50's were not as dull as people now seem to think they were. We were very
                    actively involved of course through the newspaper, and yet at a distance. In
                    other words we, those of us working at the newspaper, could not be participants
                    in the movement, although we felt deeply about it, and we were writing about it
                    and editorializing every time there were signs of the university administration
                    being intimidated by tail gunner Joe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Korean War play any role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well we were deferred as long as we maintained our good standing at
                    the university. I was deferred until I graduated but drafted immediately after
                    getting out of school, still in the Korean War period. Even at the college
                    paper, we were being bombarded with North Korean propaganda, and I still don't
                    have the vaguest idea of where that material was coming from.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How the hell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: In the mail, coming from North Korea somehow. We didn't use any, of
                    course. There was no news in it, just heavy-handed propaganda. We papered the
                    walls with it. The death of Stalin in 1953 had an enormous impact. There was one
                    professor, a Polish professor of Russian, whose name was Sigmund Zavatsky, who I
                    remember appeared on one of the many radio panel shows in which knowledgeable
                    people discussed the impact of Stalin's death. WHA, the university's statewide
                    radio station, claimed to be the oldest public radio station in the country.
                    They were having panel show after panel show. What was going to happen? Zavatsky
                    was the only person I ever heard in the entire country who said, “Watch
                    Khrushchev. He is an in-fighter and some how or other he is going to take
                    control.”</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>But the Rosenberg casthe conviction of a married couple of spying for Russia and
                    passing atomic secrets to hem — also had an enormous impact. The Labor Youth
                    League (LYL) was an organization on campus with a few extremely active members,
                    and it was as close an entity as there was to the Communist party. I remember
                    trying to get people to counter the articles they kept writing for the Op Ed
                    page. Our policy was that it was open to all students of all political views.
                    Everyday we had a submission from a member of the LYL arguing that the
                    Rosenbergs were innocent and should be spared the carrying out of their death
                    sentence. We wrote our own editorials, but certainly refused to make the case
                    the unique story of interest during that long and troubled period. Our own view
                    was that guilty or not, the death sentence for a couple who had two young
                    children was not warranted, and justice could just as well have been served by
                    life sentences. But we also wanted other views, and not many people wanted to
                    express them. I think most people felt they couldn't determine what the facts
                    were. It was too complicated. They were students and this would take time away
                    to read all the transcripts of congressional hearings and of the trial that the
                    LYL kids were thrusting at us. Also, there was no death penalty in Wisconsin
                    then or now, and perhaps people felt simply arguing against the death penalty
                    would lead to the belief that they felt the Rosenbergs were innocent. In those
                    days, reputations could be destroyed easily by such expressions, even if they
                    were right.</p>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: That came a little later, but, I suppose most people felt that because
                    of the kind of background he came from, the kind of person he was, it was
                    impossible to believe he was in fact what he was accused of being.</p>

                    against his own country</p>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes, the Labor Youth League was where they concentrated. Students for
                    a Democratic Society came later. Students for Democratic Action, which was the
                    student branch of Americans for Democratic Action, was quite active, quite
                    popular, and was firmly a liberal, outspokenly pro-democracy, anti-fascist and
                    anti communist organization.. A large part of the student body felt they were
                    there to learn agriculture or engineering or anthropology or whatever their
                    career path, who really didn't feel they had time to be involved or the
                    inclination to be involved in public affairs at that time. But I would say the
                    center of gravity of those that were politically active, would be the outlook of
                    the SDA, in that spectrum of liberal democrats centered around the fight with
                    McCarthy. But the Young Republicans were also quite active. A future Secretary
                    of State, Larry Eagleburger, was president of that organization while I was in
                    school, and we joked about it in later years. Joe McCarthy only came to the
                    University of Wisconsin campus once during my time there. I attended a speech he
                    gave at the Student Union., and he was laughed off the stage. First of all he
                    complained about the trouble he had walking because he had 10 pounds of shrapnel
                    in his leg, when most people were aware that the late Ed Bayley, the great
                    political writer for the Milwaukee Journal and a dear friend, had already gotten
                    McCarthy's army records and proved that his purple heart for the injury to his
                    leg came from an incident during an initiation ceremony when he crossed the
                    equator for the first time. He had fallen from a ladder and broken his leg
                    because the initiation required him to do so with a pail tied to his leg. That
                    is how he got himself a purple heart. But the line in that appearance that did
                    him in was when, in answer to a student's question of his opinion of General
                    Douglas MacArthur, who had just been relieved of his command in Korea by
                    President Truman, he said he thought Gen. MacArthur was “the greatest military
                    genius since Genghis Khan.” He left the stage when the laughter wouldn't subside
                    and he never came back to the campus again.</p>

                        want to be a newspaperman that is the place to go. What sort of a class did
                        they have, I mean was it a good center to learn about newspapers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I learned about the newspaper business from working on the Daily
                    Cardinal., the student newspaper that we published five times a week. I found
                    the journalism department a little bit disappointing because there were only one
                    or two outstanding people there. Graham Hovey was the most impressive. He had
                    worked for the Minneapolis Tribune and the New Republic, later worked for the
                    New York Times, both as a reporter and then as an editorial writer. I saw him
                    last at lunch at the State Department, when he was covering African affairs for
                    the Times. He was one of the two journalism professors from whom I really
                    learned a lot. But it was one of the oldest journalism departments in the
                    country, maybe the first, and it had some very traditional methods. I just found
                    it useful to stay as a journalism major because it gave me an opportunity to
                    move widely through all of the social sciences. I think I had as many credits in
                    political science as I had in journalism. I really learned the newspaper
                    business by working five nights a week and in the summer at the Daily Cardinal.
                    One summer I stayed in Madison and ran the summer paper. I not only wrote almost
                    everything in the paper, but set type in the back room and made engravings,
                    plastic engravings. So I came out of Wisconsin really well trained in the
                    business, but more because of the student newspaper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In view of your later career, how much did the
                        international world intrude on you while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I think because of the war and its aftermath, we were very
                    internationally minded. Students who could afford it or find some very cheap way
                    to do it would get to Europe during the summer. This was soon enough after the
                    war that it was cheap once you got there. There was still a lot to be learned
                    about the immediate aftermath of the war. There was, of course, the war itself
                    in Korea, the threat of conflict, the fear of conflict with the Soviet Union.
                    You couldn't escape it. It was everywhere. Domestic politics was very much on
                    our mind. I am not sure whether our love for Adlai Stevenson had as much to do
                    with the external threat as it did with the internal threat, because we were
                    frightened by what McCarthyism was doing not only to the nation but even the
                    campus. I remember there was an episode in which a beloved history professor had
                    authored an anthology. I can't remember the theme, but we found one entry, one
                    professor's entry had been dropped because there had been an allegation that he
                    had leftist ties, which were no more than allegations. I wrote a painfully
                    careful — because it hurt us to do so — editorial decrying that act. We saw this
                    creeping fear. It was ever present. So that we felt that McCarthyism and the
                    fear that it engendered was a distraction to the real threat to America, which
                    was external.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you following events taking courses, events in China
                        or Soviet Union or Europe or elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Oh yes. I took courses in international affairs. There was a wonderful
                    professor of history, a professor named Michael Petrovich, who taught Russian
                    history. He had been in the OSS in the war, parachuted into Yugoslavia. We had
                    another professor named Jaroslav Majda who was an escapee from Czechoslovakia
                    and who told stories, meaningful to me because later on I served in Berlin,
                    about his first night in Berlin which was during the airlift, and the enormous
                    reassurance he had hearing those planes going over every minute as a
                    demonstration of the incredible power of the West. He was a delight. He taught
                    courses in the political structure of Eastern Europe, Eastern European
                    governments and economics of Eastern Europe. So I think that when you talk about
                    international affairs in those days, in my mind and I think most of our minds,
                    it inevitably revolved around potential conflict, not so much with China but
                    with the Soviet Union certainly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated in 1954, what were you planning to do/</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well I knew the army was awaiting me. I couldn't get a job because I
                    was 1-A in the draft. UPI had offered me a job and then pulled it away as soon
                    as they found out I was 1-A, because under the Guild agreement they would have
                    had to give me a pay increase each year, at least on paper, and I would have a
                    claim to the job at the increased rate when I was discharged. So I checked with
                    the draft board to find out when I was scheduled to be called. They said,
                    November. I said, “Well that just wastes months of my life,” and I volunteered
                    for the draft. They moved me up to August. I spent July reading War and Peace,
                    drifting in my brother-in-law's little speed boat in Jamaica Bay. I would go out
                    when it was calm. I would float there with a six pack of beer and read War and
                    Peace. I went in to the army, ended up spending 2 � years in it. I did Basic
                    Training at Fort Dix, and turned down an offer to go to Officer's Training
                    School because I told them I didn't want to jeopardize my amateur status.
                    Because I had taken some Russian language courses in college they classified me
                    as a Russian linguist. I had a very limited vocabulary. I could read some, but
                    my conversational ability was extremely limited. They put me along with other
                    linguists, guys classified as linguists, in clerk typist school while we were
                    getting security clearances. Then, since clearances took longer than the eight
                    weeks of clerk-typist school, they were going to make us firemen, which meant we
                    had to get up at dawn and stoke the coal-burning fireplaces in the barracks.
                    Everybody scrambled to find something else to do. I got myself into the public
                    information office at Fort Dix, where I got in trouble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I was being fitted for a gas masks with prescription lenses, and while
                    I was there waiting to be called, I saw a note on the door on the bulletin
                    board. The title was Things that Soldiers at Fort Dix Have Been Hit In The Eye
                    With. It was a long list — a cartridge shell, pebbles, this and that, everything
                    imaginable. The last entry was Irving Schwartz. So I copied it verbatim and
                    wrote it and sent it out, and by God it ended up on the front page of the New
                    York Times in a prominent little box. We were getting phone calls from AP, UP
                    and other papers; “who is Irving Schwartz, where is he?” So I was ordered to
                    find out. I called the ophthalmologist's office, and he laughed and said, “It's
                    a joke. He's a doctor here.” So I admitted that to the Captain in charge of
                    public affairs at Ft. Dix and he said, “You handle it.” I told the media he was
                    in Korea and we couldn't find him, couldn't determine what unit he was with. I
                    learned a lesson from that. Be careful what you write, even when you have a job
                    you don't take too seriously.</p>
                <p>I really wanted to get overseas, but instead I was sent to a military
                    intelligence company in Fort Meade, very near Washington. It was a very strange
                    place. There were sergeants speaking Romanian and other exotic languages to each
                    other who would spend the day lounging in the mess hall, while privates and even
                    junior sergeants had to do KP. I talked to the executive officer and I asked,
                    “What are your plans for me?” When I first came they made me write a military
                    history of a company that was going out of business. They thought I had a Ph.D.
                    in English. I don't know where they got that idea from. But that saved me from
                    kitchen police for a couple of months. Then I said, “What happens now?” They
                    told me they would send me to Fort Reilly, Kansas to study military intelligence
                    analysis. Then I would come back to Fort Meade and do KP. As they needed people,
                    they filled in vacancies overseas, but unless there was a particular need or
                    something breaks out, my army career would be doing KP and calisthenics.” So
                    that seemed like a dismal way to spend my time in the army and I got back into
                    public information through contacts with the corporals in personnel who really
                    run the army. We were covering a maneuver in Little Creek, Virginia, near
                    Norfolk. Awful living, in Quonset huts. It was a miserable day and my corporal
                    friend called from Fort Meade and said, “OK we have an overseas assignment list.
                    Do you want to go to Hawaii or Germany?” I said, “Germany,” because I really
                    wanted to get to Europe. So I was sent on the USS Geiger which put out a
                    newspaper called The Geiger Counter.</p>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Did you really? What a scow! It took nine days to get to Europe. A
                    terrible crossing, but I worked my way out of the below sea level hell in which
                    we were stacked in five layers of canvas hammocks as far as the eye could see,
                    with people getting sick from the top down. Ugh! I put out the newspaper, the
                    Geiger Counter, and was able to sleep above decks on a couch in the office.
                    Meanwhile, the major I had worked for on the maneuver was a very glamorous
                    officer who had been the army's public relations liaison to the movie industry
                    in Hollywood. He looked the part too. He would get them the tanks they needed
                    for a battle scene. He said he knew the head of U.S. Army information operation
                    in Heidelberg. I remember his name, Walter Pennino, because he later became
                    public relations head for NASA. He took care of the astronauts and I ran into
                    him in Brussels years later. His wife, Martha Pennino, was the chairman of the
                    Board of Supervisors in Fairfax County. I was supposed to call him and he would
                    get me into the office of public information for Europe, headquartered in
                    Heidelberg.</p>
                <p>We got off the ship in Bremerhaven. I don't know if you took the same route.
                    There was a train virtually on the wharf, and you get on it. You are shoved,
                    stuffed literally into a compartment with five other guys and five other duffel
                    bags. You don't stop for 17 hours until you get to Zweibrucken where you have a
                    re-classification center which was really run I think by former German
                    concentration camp guards because we were on a strict assembly line. You got a
                    haircut. Your uniform was pressed. You got an interview. You are sent off as if
                    you had just come into the army, new classification. I got into my interview and
                    I said to the personnel clerk: “Look, I am supposed to call this guy in
                    Heidelberg who I am supposed to see about working for him at the EUSAREUR PIO.
                    He said, “That is where I have you going.” So he gave me a ticket to Heidelberg.
                    When I got there I went to see Col. Pennino, thinking that my friendly major had
                    arranged this assignment, and Pennino said “Who the hell are you?” I mentioned

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The best known news anchor of the time — the first well- known
                    television newscaster whose sponsor, I remember, was Camel Cigarettes. Pennino
                    gave me a pass. He said, “Go enjoy Heidelberg. I will find a job for you
                    somewhere.” I think I was sitting in the Red Ox, a famous student hangout from
                    the days of The Student Prince. I met a friend from Wisconsin and we were having
                    a beer when I was told to get back to Pennino's office immediately. I was
                    leaving, and I had a ticket for Berlin. Pennino said, “Don't worry, it's a good
                    job.” On the overnight military train I met a sergeant in the dining car who
                    looked at my orders and said, “Oh God, they have you in the headquarters
                    company. It's terrible. You work all week and then you have to drill on
                    Saturdays. You're lucky if you have Sunday to yourself.” So I said, “Well, I'm
                    done in.” When I got off the train he said, “C'mon, I'll show you where the bus
                    to Lichterfelde West is.” That was the headquarter company barracks housed in a
                    former German military academy. Then there was an announcement, “Achtung Private
                    Zuckerman.” A car was waiting for me, and I gave him a ride. I was assigned to
                    the office of the U.S. Commander of Berlin. I ended up in the intelligence
                    section. There were 14 officers and 13 enlisted men in the office of the
                    Commander, Major Gen. George Konen. All the enlisted men were college graduates,
                    some from Ivy League schools, and were treated very well. We were given extra
                    pay to eat off base because we often worked very late. We wore our uniforms
                    during the day, and thereafter we were free to enjoy a great city, which was
                    full of great music, theater, restaurants and clubs. There were only six
                    thousand American soldiers in Berlin, so it didn't have the air of a garrison
                    town, and Americans were still very admired because of the memory of the Berlin
                    airlift, which had ended only seven years before I got there. Because I extended
                    my enlistment for six months, I was able to do the grand tour of Europe at the
                    expense of the U.S. Army. The work itself was, as all military work usually is,
                    brief periods of great of excitement with long periods of boredom in between. I
                    was there during the Poznan uprising and the Hungarian rebellion, as well as the
                    digging up by the East Germans of the US underground tap on the main trunk phone
                    line from Soviet HQ to Moscow.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: '56. I was there from May of '55 to January of '57. During the
                    Hungarian uprising I slept on my desk those nights when we were sending
                    reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well as a soldier, what did you do in these times of
                        crises?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well the intelligence office of the U.S. commander of Berlin was the
                    liaison and contact with all of the operating intelligence agencies in Berlin,
                    which had to funnel material through us to keep the U.S. commander of Berlin,
                    who was the senior U.S. presence in that last occupied territory of WW II,
                    informed of what was going on. The U.S. mission to Berlin, our diplomatic
                    mission, was subordinate to him. So he had to be kept informed from them of what
                    was going on and what they were doing. I was reviewing incoming reports, pulling
                    them together, rewriting them and passing them on to the officers in the unit,
                    who would look at them, edit it and send them on to the General. I was also
                    responsible for gathering the weekly refugee numbers before the uprisings. This
                    was before the Wall. We were getting 3,000 East Germans a week coming into the
                    refugee camps in Berlin. These were mostly young workers. That is why the wall
                    was built, in order to stem the loss of their work force. Then there were floods
                    of East European refugees who would come though during these periods of
                    uprisings. We saw many of the interrogation reports coming in from the refugee
                    camps and they were fascinating. When this wasn't happening, I had time not only
                    to do reading I had never had time to do in collegall of the novels of Thomas
                    Mann and Fyodor Dostoevsky —, but also to read through the extraordinary files
                    in the intelligence office on all that had happened in Berlin from the earliest
                    days of the occupation until the present, including some very wild episodes of
                    Soviet kidnapping of important judges and other important German members of the
                    city government.. And we also had the opportunity to go to East Berlin without
                    any barriers. We were encouraged to go and show the uniform, go to the opera, or
                    walk around Alexanderplatz, one of the principal centers of the city. I saw a
                    film the other night which included a scene of Alexanderplatz that, when I was
                    there, didn't have a car in it or passing through it. You could have had a
                    picnic in the center of Alexanderplatz. Now it is just teeming with life. But
                    there was never any doubt in the mind of anybody who saw East Berlin or who
                    spoke, as I had many opportunities to do, to refugees from the east, of the
                    differences between east and west. Nobody had any confusion, as did some of the
                    kids I knew in college, about who was telling the truth about the conditions in
                    each other's society. It was part of my continuing education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling in Berlin during the Hungarian
                        uprising particularly also the post wives. There was real concern about war
                        wives. If it was going to happen it would be Berlin. Were we practicing I
                        surrender in Russian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: No. We had a very small force, 6,000 troops, real troops, not like us.
                    We had a tank brigade. We knew why we were there. We were a trip wire. They had
                    to kill us in order to take Berlin, and if they killed us, there was war. But I
                    remember — was it Poznan or was it the Hungarian uprising? the latter I'm sure —
                    when Willy Brandt, then mayor of Berlin, went to the Brandenburg Gate to talk a
                    huge crowd out of marching into East Berlin to protest. Soviet tanks were lined
                    up with their cannons pointed at street level on the other side of the Gate.
                    Brandt convinced those people to people to go home and light a candle in their
                    window.</p>

                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the mayor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes. Every window, you couldn't see a window in Berlin without a
                    candle in it. It provoked very deep feelings. Berlin then was probably the most
                    pro American place that there has ever been on earth, including America. I mean,
                    it wasn't that long after the airlift, and people remembered that period. But
                    the feelings of Berliners extended to the East as well, and they had great
                    empathy with those in East Germany and the nations of Eastern Europe. Berlin was
                    full of �migr�s in those days, as it had been even before the war. It was a
                    magnet for Hungarians, Poles, Rumanians, and particularly �migr� Russians. The
                    Berlin Ballet was organized by �migr� Russians, a family named Gsovsky. And one
                    of the best clubs in town was the Boyar Bar, where aging Russian dancers gamely
                    put on a show of very athletic traditional dances every night. I often wonder
                    how long they were able to keep that up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the American diplomatic presence

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I knew some of the people in the Mission, but I had more contact with
                    intelligence people, with the CIA people, with the army intelligence, naval
                    intelligence. They were the people that came to the office. I did meet some of
                    the diplomatic people but the furthest thing from my mind was seeking a Foreign
                    Service career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being a corporal. Was Berlin in those days really the
                        intelligence playground for both sides and every unit both east and
                        west.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I was there when they dug up the tunnel. I didn't know about the
                    tunnel. That was really held quite tightly. But we were having a visit by
                    several senators, and there was a standard routine in place called the Blue
                    Plate Special. We had the last horse platoon in the United States Army. The
                    chrome domes, the horseback riders with chromed helmets, would ride up the ramp
                    leading to the headquarters of the U.S. Army in Berlin, the U.S. command in
                    Berlin, which was the old headquarters of the eastern wing of the Luftwaffe. It
                    was very imposing. It was a very long, cobble stone driveway leading up to the
                    main building in the compound. The dignitaries stood at the head of the driveway
                    and the platoon would ride up and form ranks for inspection. Well, while this
                    was going on, this military intelligence major in civvies, looking as he had
                    been awake all night, walked right through the line, by passed the senators,
                    whispered something in the ear of the U.S. commander of Berlin — it was Major
                    General Dasher at the time — who took his leave from the senators and just
                    walked away. It turned out he was telling him that East Germans had dug up the
                    tunnel.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The tunnel was dug under the border between the British sector and the Russian
                    sector of Berlin, and tapped into the trunk line from Soviet military
                    headquarters in East Berlin to Moscow. It turns out apparently that, at some
                    time before this happened, the Russians found out about it and were probably
                    feeding us false information along with credible information. Just part of the
                    spy vs. spy game. There is a book out about it — my wife is reading it — “Spies
                    Beneath Berlin.” It was something to remember. The East Germans made a filmed
                    news clip out of the unearthing of it and it was shown in West Berlin theaters.
                    When it came on the screen with the accompanying East German condemnation of the
                    evil spies who dared to steal other peoples private conversations, West Berlin
                    audiences would laugh and cheer. They were delighted at the sight of the Soviets
                    having their own tricks turned against them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what were you thinking about doing? This is the
                        heyday of the GI Bill. You knew you could use that for all sorts of
                        purposes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes, I wanted to, and I thought of going back to school right away.
                    But 2 � years out of college, I really wanted to get my feet wet in the
                    newspaper business first. So I went back to New York in January of 1957 when I
                    was discharged, and started planning to look for a newspaper job with one of the
                    papers there, with my first choice the New York Times, of course.. My college
                    room mate Dick Schickel, was working for I think, Sports Illustrated at the
                    time. He had a girlfriend who was working for Funk &amp; Wagnalls, the publisher
                    that put out an encyclopedia and an annual yearbook. They needed editing help,
                    he said, and he was quite right in advising me that it was better to look for a
                    job when you have one. They needed editing help right away and they offered me
                    $60 a week. So I think I was out of the army three days, and I went to work as
                    an assistant editor at this place, while I looked for a newspaper job. My father
                    had a boyhood friend who was then circulation manager of the New York Times and
                    I got in to see him. He sent me to the personnel director of the New York Times
                    who interviewed me at length and then sent me to another office to give me a
                    test. It wasn't the writing test I expected; it was more of an intelligence
                    test. I was applying elsewhere, and put an ad in Editor and Publisher magazine
                    which brought more than a dozen offers from my brief ad saying “veteran,
                    journalism school graduate, seeks promising start”. Then I got a call from the
                    New York Times. They called me in and offered me a job. They said,
                    “Congratulations, you are one of the three applicants we have chosen for jobs as
                    news assistants for the New York Times.” I said, “What's a news assistant?”
                    “Well that is our development program. You will work in the newsroom helping
                    reporters. Eventually you learn our style, you learn the ropes. If you show
                    promise, and we feel that we want you as a reporter, a permanent reporter, you
                    will become a reporter.” I said, “How long is this process?' “It is typically
                    four years.” I said, “What do you pay?” “Forty five dollars a week.” I just
                    thought I couldn't do that. I felt that if I did spend four years doing that, my
                    spirit would be broken. I knew some friends who went through it and had nice
                    careers at the Times. I don't know if it was a mistake or not, but I turned it
                    down.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It reminds me a bit of the Ph.D. business. They take
                        people who are all full of piss and vinegar just out of undergraduate thing,

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well I think probably looking back on it, I was ready to begin
                    reporting, and not assisting reporters. It turned out I was a very good at it. I
                    probably would have made it in less than four years at the Times, but it was a
                    huge organization. I have met many New York Times people who spent their careers
                    there, who wouldn't work anywhere else, and there is no finer news organization
                    in the world. But I don't know. You make your choices and you live with them. I
                    took a job in the South because the major national story at the time was the
                    attempt to enforce the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court in Brown versus Board
                    of Education. I took a job on the Georgia- Alabama border with the Columbus
                    Enquirer in Columbus, GA. I went down there in May of 1957 and stayed for two
                    years. I covered Alabama politics, Russell County Alabama government, and George
                    Wallace's first run for governor when he was beaten by someone who was more
                    racist than he was, leading Wallace to promise that would never happen agaithat
                    no one would outmaneuver him on the race issue.</p>

                        Alabama certainly not a place to be black but also to be Jewish too. Or had
                        that not happened yet because there wasn't the liberal pressure.</hi>

                    only with blacks but also with Catholics and Jews. No, I had a wonderful
                    experience in the two years I was there. One of the most memorable things was
                    covering Phenix City, Alabama, which, you may remember, was once called
                    America's sin city.</p>

                    play in Phenix City, which was born as a sin city. In the 19th century there was
                    a picket boat that came up the Chattahoochee River; good folks got off in
                    Columbus, and the prostitutes and card sharps were forced to get off in what
                    became Phenix City on the Alabama side. The character of the town never changed.
                    In 1954 there was a lawyer in Phenix City who ran for attorney general, the
                    Democratic nomination for attorney general, on a platform of cleaning up Phenix
                    City. He won the nomination and was shot dead a few days later in broad daylight
                    on the main street of town. The grand jury indicted the district attorney and
                    deputy sheriff for the murder. They returned 640 indictments and shut down the
                    town, cleaned out the whore houses and the gambling dens and bars. That was a
                    couple of years before I got there, but the events were still simmering. The
                    circuit judge of Phenix City was disqualified from handling the case because he
                    was knee deep in the rackets himself, but he survived as judge. His name was
                    Julius B. Hicks and he was a very old man. He was almost blind. I remember one
                    day, I was in the office of the clerk of circuit court, going through the
                    records to see what had happened the day before. There was a quickie divorce
                    racket running in town, and I wanted to see if there were any famous names that
                    showed up, such as the woman who wrote the novel “Peyton Place.” People would
                    come down from New York, declare themselves as intending to remain and become
                    citizens of Alabama, get a divorce that next day and go home.</p>
                <p>The judge, who ruled on all these divorces and perhaps had an arrangement with
                    the lawyers who brought in the case, was having a conversation in a voice loud
                    enough for me to hear across the room. He said — his teeth used to clack when he
                    talked — he said to someone sitting across from him: 'You know I have this farm
                    in Jasper, Florida, and I take the Central of Georgia down there each weekend.
                    The other week I was going down there and shared a compartment with this fellow
                    who looked out the window as we passed through this little town in south
                    Georgia.” He said, “See that town? I grew up in that town. That is the cleanest,
                    nicest little town in Georgia.” He said, “You know why it is clean and nice?”
                    The judge said, “No, why is that?” “Because there ain't a Jew in it.” Silence
                    followed, and I kept turning the pages of the court records, thinking OK, now
                    its coming. But the judge continued: “And then I said to him, maybe that's why
                    it's just a little town.” I took that as a signal to me. He was doing the whole
                    thing for me.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Other things happened that helped me get accepted by the court house crowd. I was
                    covering a city commission meeting, and a man who was an engineer for the
                    Central of Georgia railroad came in to complain that his fellow conductors and
                    engineers were coming through Phenix City too fast at night and blowing their
                    whistles, rather than slow their speed, and waking everyone up and somebody
                    ought to do something about that, like complain to the Central of Georgia. Then
                    he turned to me and he said, “I don't want to see this in the paper.” His name
                    was Buster something. I said, “Buster this is a public meeting, an open
                    meeting.” He said, “You better not put this in the paper.” So I went back to the
                    office and wrote a story on the important things that happened at the meeting,
                    and then a little story, a side bar, on the Central of Georgia engineer who
                    complained about trains speeding through Phenix City. The next day, it was in
                    the paper, and as usual, I drove over the bridge, over the river to park by the
                    Russell County Court House and make my rounds. The circuit solicitor, that is
                    what they call the district attorney in the south, his name was Roy Green, he
                    looked in the car and said, “Hey you better watch out. Buster is in there
                    waiting for you.” I said, “What is he saying?.” “He says he's going to kill
                    you.” “Well what are you going to do about it?” “Well if he does that, I am just
                    going to have to arrest him I guess.” I went in the door. I came in and the
                    swinging door just flung me against the wall. It was Buster. He was an elderly
                    man, pretty big, but this was a long corridor, with the offices of the various
                    county officials on either side of it. There was the circuit clerk, the clerk of
                    courts, the tax assessor, the tax commissioner, the sheriff, all of them lined
                    up. Buster came down that hall pounding at me with his right arm. I kept
                    blocking the punch. I said, “Buster, cut it out. You made a fool out of yourself
                    once already and now you're doing it again,” and kept backing up and not
                    swinging back at him. All those people came to stand at their doors and watch
                    this. I said, “Isn't anybody going to stop this?” Finally the sheriff came up,
                    and Buster was huffing and puffing. “Buster”, he said, “it's ok. You got what
                    you wanted. Why don't you go home.” He got suspended for thirty days by the
                    Central of Georgia. Some days after that, the wife of the clerk of courts,
                    Gladys Wheelis, said, “You know, you're accepted now.” “Why is that?” “Because
                    you didn't swing back at Buster.”</p>
                <p>So I learned a lot about personal relationships, because in places like that,
                    everybody knows each other. Entertainment is people entertaining other people in
                    their homes. There were a couple of movie theaters and restaurants, but no real
                    bars except Chad's Rose Room which was left over from the old Phenix City days,
                    and they only served beer. They had a strip show and a dirty comic on a circuit
                    that ran in a few towns from New Orleans to Atlanta with a stop at Phenix City.
                    That is where we went for entertainment when we closed the newspaper down at
                    midnight. Somebody would go early and get a table.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sort of learn the lesson not to be you know, I
                        mean too much a wise guy, smart guy and looking down on the people and
                        writing cute little things in the paper.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well, the story on Buster wasn't cute. It was straight reporting. And
                    when someone warns you not to write something that takes place at an open
                    meeting, and all the people at the meeting hear it said, you feel you have to
                    write it. Besides, it was a valid story. But a story that was cute and demeaning
                    to someone wouldn't get past the editor. Anyway, I didn't feel that way. First
                    of all, there were some very good newspapermen on that staff. There were also
                    some very good lawyers in that little town, who read every word you wrote.
                    Southerners are good lawyers although in every little case they handle they
                    always seem to try to make it a grand constitutional issue. There was one I
                    remember, he was not from there. He was from a nearby town, Opelika. He was
                    trying a case and telling the jury “I'm just a country boy like you folks”...but
                    he was a Harvard educated lawyer. Any little land seizure for a right of way or
                    something became a constitutional issue. “They are taking this man's land, his
                    property, the land his grandpappy farmed on”, etc. But it wasn't about the
                    Constitution; it was about money.One issue was always present however, either
                    openly or behind the scenes, and that was race.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is very early on, and here you are coming from
                        Wisconsin and New York. How did you adjust to this? What were your
                        observations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well I felt first of all, that I was welcome in some ways. The reason
                    I took that job was because I had a letter from Graham Hovey who was my favorite
                    professor in the journalism department, who I had listed, with his permission as
                    a reference. He wrote me a letter and he said, “I got a call from the managing
                    editor of the Columbus Enquirer. He asked me about you and what you were like
                    and everything. I told him you were a bit of a hell raiser, and the editor said,
                    “Well maybe we need a little hell raised around here.” Later, we became great
                    friends, He was a terrific newspaper man who taught me a lot, Dave Miller. I
                    went down there by train, just to make sure I realized how far away I'd be from
                    home, and to get the feeling of the South as more than a stop between airports.
                    I gained enormous experience on that paper, and worked very hard and sometimes
                    up to fourteen or sixteen hours a day. One day I had seven bylines in that
                    paper. I was writing everything. I would cover the city commission, the county
                    commission, the courts, the police, the hospital in Phenix City. Often I would
                    work from ten in the morning until midnight. I would cover the late police run
                    on the Columbus side of the river. They had me writing movie reviews, music
                    reviews, book reviews. You name it; I did it. When I left there, I used the GI
                    Bill and went back to graduate school in Wisconsin, where I was offered a
                    research assistantship in the political science department. All I really wanted
                    was a year to do some serious reading</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is when you headed back to Wisconsin.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Back to Madison. I had wanted to go to the University of Vienna. I had
                    been working on my German with a teacher in Georgia, but they wanted me to
                    demonstrate a knowledge of Latin. I decided that was probably the wrong
                    political science department for me. Going back to Wisconsin was very
                    stimulating. I was determined not to spend more than a year there before
                    returning to newspaper work, and it turned out to be about the most focused
                    academic experience of my life. The master's program was usually two years, but
                    I was able to complete my course work, my orals and write my thesis in one year.
                    I still had two more years of academic benefits remaining on the GI Bill, and my
                    professors wanted me to stay on or go elsewhere for a Ph.D. I knew I didn't want
                    to; I didn't want to abandon my career in newspaper work. I had an offer from
                    the New York World Telegram and Sun where I had interviewed on my way back to
                    Wisconsin. The day of my orals, I got a phone call from the assistant managing
                    editor who said, “The job is still here for you, but I don't think that this
                    newspaper will last more than six months. And there are going to be a lot of
                    very experienced people on the streets.” The professor I worked for as a
                    research assistant, Jim Donahue, had good friends at the Milwaukee Journal,
                    which at that time was considered one of the best papers in the country. I had
                    interviewed with them. They offered me a job, but I thought I would go back to
                    New York. Once I realized that was a bad idea I took the job with the Milwaukee
                    Journal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were with the Milwaukee Journal from when to
                        when.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: From 1960 to 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Milwaukee Journal like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well there was a huge difference from Columbus. We had seven or eight
                    reporters at the Columbus Enquirer, and there were 140 at the Milwaukee Journal.
                    It was a great paper with a long and proud history. Milwaukee was an interesting
                    city, a real labor union city. They humiliated me by making me do a couple of
                    months on obituaries while I learned the Milwaukee Journal's style book. But
                    then our labor writer, John Pomfret, went off on a Niemann fellowship to Harvard
                    (he recently retired as Executive Vice President and General Manager of the New
                    York Times.) I was assigned to fill in for him during the year he'd be at
                    Harvard, and the managing editor said to me, “He is going to come back, but he
                    is not going to come back as labor writer. If you want that job, you have to
                    apply for it.” “I have to apply for it?” “Yes, other people are applying.” So I
                    applied, and they made me labor reporter, which was a huge break because there
                    were 400,000 labor associated people, families or active union members, in
                    Wisconsin.. The United Auto Workers were very big because American Motors was
                    still there. The Brewery Workers Union of course, Steel Workers, Machinists, the
                    building trades unions, Teamsters and others. The Milwaukee Journal was wealthy
                    enough and interested enough that I got to travel to the major union
                    conventions, to the quarterly executive meetings of the AFL-CIO in New York, to
                    the AFL-CIO convention wherever it was held. During the strike against the
                    Milwaukee Journal by the Mailers Union, which I covered, I was forced to come in
                    at 6:00 in the morning and finish writing everything I had covered the day
                    before by 9:00 a.m. because they were pasting up the newspaper by an offset
                    printing process since the other unionprinters, engravers and the rest —
                    wouldn't cross the Mailers' picket line. The strike lasted for months, and I was
                    really getting run down. The AFL-CIO was going to hold its convention in Miami
                    in December, and I suggested that it would really look bad to our readers if we
                    didn't cover it. By then the strike was still on but it was old news, and they
                    grudgingly let me go. The strike ended while I was in Miami, and I got a lot of
                    dirty looks from my colleagues when I returned to cold, snowy Milwaukee with a
                    great tan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of what you were seeing of the
                        labor movement during this time in the early 60's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: During that time it was still on the ascendance. You had that feeling,
                    particularly because of the leadership of the UAW, which really broke so much
                    ground in terms of not just wages but benefits. We were approaching a guaranteed
                    wage for unionized workers in the US because Walter Reuther had negotiated
                    supplementary unemployment benefits paid by the automobile companies, because
                    they were always down for part of the year retooling for the new models. So auto
                    workers didn't ever work a full year. But SUB went up to 80% of their annual
                    pay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: SUB means...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: SUB, supplementary unemployment benefits up to 80% of their earnings.
                    Everybody figured one day it would be 90% and then 100%, so they would be
                    guaranteed they would receive their wage for a whole year, just the way a white
                    collar worker did. That didn't happen. As we now realize, we had lived through
                    the peak years of the organized labor movement in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well from a Milwaukee perspective how did you view the
                        Kennedy administration and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I was still with the Milwaukee Journal during the Cuban missile crisis
                    and I remember the entire staff glued to the television set in the lounge area,
                    with everyone impressed by the seriousness of the situation and Kennedy's
                    precise explanation of it. Kennedy was a strong favorite in the newsroom,
                    although we did have a number of more conservative staff members. I think he
                    became enormously popular in Wisconsin during his presidency, and that was
                    certainly true throughout the country. Two people in Wisconsin, the then
                    attorney general John Reynolds and the then Democratic Party chairman Patrick J.
                    Lucey, had convinced Kennedy that he could win the 1960 Wisconsin primary, even
                    though Hubert Humphrey was considered the third senator from Wisconsin at a time
                    when Joe McCarthy and Alexander Wiley were the two conservative Republican
                    senators. He represented the aspirations of the liberals in Wisconsin. As it
                    turned out, Kennedy agreed to enter and won, and always regarded the Wisconsin
                    Democrats as the people who started him on the road to the presidency.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q. What were some of the highlights of your time at the
                        Journal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: When I first arrived there, despite my experience in Georgia, they put
                    me on the obituaries desk along with other newly-hired young reporters who
                    hadn't had my experience. I was at a desk alongside one occasionally occupied by
                    the most revered member of the staff, Richard Smith Davis, a man well in his
                    70's (it doesn't seem so old now) who was the music and arts critic, and the
                    most gifted writer at the Journal. He was always assigned the most memorable
                    events to covethe concert by Jan Paderewski, the funeral of President
                    Rooseveland when he died, the Journal published a book containing his finest
                    stories. He took me under his wing, and invited me to his cottage in Door County
                    in northern Wisconsin, where I still vacation to this day. He was an
                    unforgettable wit and curmudgeon. After he had a stroke and was hospitalized,
                    with his doctor's consent for Halloween I sneaked a weak bourbon and water into
                    his room hidden in a pumpkin. He loved it. He was very outspoken but none of the
                    editors dared criticize him. One day the Managing Editor passed by our desks as
                    Davis was bestowing some of his wisdom upon me. Davis interrupted himself and
                    said in a loud voice clearly directed at the Managing Editor: “And above all
                    young man, never, never be impressed by mediocrity.” The editor almost tripped
                    but righted himself without ever looking Davis' way.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>After a couple of months on obit I was assigned the labor beat, but before I
                    could dig into it a riot broke out during the attempt to integrate the
                    University of Georgia. Because I had worked there, they sent me down to cover
                    the events that were expected to be violent when another attempt was made to
                    integrate the two black students after the weekend. I flew down to Atlanta and
                    read back issues of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution in their newsroom to
                    get caught up, then went back to the hotel to attempt to contact former Atlanta
                    mayor William Hartsfield, who was considered the wisest man in Georgia politics.
                    Somehow I got him on the phone, but he said he didn't give interviews to out of
                    town newsmen who didn't know anything about the state and always got things
                    wrong. When I told him that I had worked for the Columbus Enquirer, he changed
                    his mind. He told me everyone was wrong about their expectations; that Governor
                    Ernest Vandiver, a Republican, was getting enormous pressure from the business
                    community to see to it that the violence was put down and that integration
                    proceeded peacefully. They felt that the economic future of the state depended
                    on investment from the north and that that would be influenced by progress the
                    state could make in peaceful integration. Hartfield said that Vandiver had
                    “crossed the Rubicon”, and that the two young black students would go to school
                    on Monday. I wrote the story that way and sent it back to my paper, and they
                    called me and asked if I was sure about that since everyone else had it the
                    other way. I told them that Hartsfield was the smartest guy in Georgia and I
                    trusted him, but I didn't sleep very well over the weekend in Athens when I saw
                    crowds gathering on Sunday night to prepare for the next morning. But Hartsfield
                    got it right and made me look good. The State troopers and National Guard were
                    there to keep the rebellious students in line, and the university was
                    integrated. One of the two students was Charlene Hunter Gault, who went on to
                    become a well respected correspondent for PBS.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q. What other stories stick in your mind from your years at
                        the Journal?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I remember covering a speech by the then Senator John F. Kennedy
                    during the presidential campaign in 1962, and getting to meet him for the first
                    time. (A couple of years later I met him both in Washington and in northern
                    Wisconsin when I worked for the Governor.) But after his speech an ugly incident
                    occurred as he was driven from the auditorium to another event in an open
                    convertible. There was a group of elegant party-goers who were apparently not
                    fans of his, and one of the ladies threw a glass of scotch at him, but forgot to
                    let go of the glass. It missed Kennedy, but struck a wealthy donor from
                    Milwaukee seated with him. Also nearby was the hapless sheriff of Milwaukee, a
                    fellow named Clem Michalski. I hadn't seen the incident but word of it traveled
                    fast, and I got to Michalski and asked him if he had made an arrest. He said:
                    “No, I called a cop but they couldn't find the guy.” I wrote a small side bar
                    story to go with the story on the speech that couldn't help but make the sheriff
                    look silly, admitting that he called a police officer to do a job that he might
                    have done himself. The next day he called me at the newsroom and I was sure he
                    was going to raise hell with the editor, but he was quite calm in asking for a
                    correction. “But I got it right, Clem,” I said. “That's exactly what you told
                    me. He said: “No it's not. I never used the word cop. I said I called a
                    policeman.” I learned then that there are many people in public life who don't
                    realize not to make things worse once they make fools of themselves.</p>
                <p>Since you mention Kennedy, my most memorable impression of him was formed at an
                    address he gave to a largely faculty audience while I was in graduate school
                    during the presidential primary of 1960. Kennedy was not popular among the
                    faculty because they were committed to a third candidacy by Adlai Stevenson and
                    also distrusted the Kennedys, because as a family they were close to Joe
                    McCarthy. Bobby Kennedy had worked as the counsel to McCarthy's senate committee
                    and father Joe Kennedy was a McCarthy supporter. Kennedy was introduced to this
                    initially hostile audience by one of my favorite professors, David Fellman, who
                    taught constitutional law in the Political Science department. I remember his
                    words as the best political speech I had ever heard. His introduction in its
                    entirety was: “Ladies and gentleman. I present to you the only man who stands
                    between Richard Nixon and the presidency of the United States, John F. Kennedy.”
                    Kennedy looked so thin in profile that every woman in the audience wanted to
                    cook a meal for him. He was elegant, precise, and persuasive. I'm sure most of
                    the audience voted against him in the primary, but rather than stay at home,
                    that evening convinced them to vote for him in the general election.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>But almost all of my work was taken up by my labor affairs assignment. Milwaukee
                    then was a highly unionized city, and was the third heaviest steel using city in
                    the country. American Motors, Harnischfeger, Allis-Chalmers, and many other
                    heavy industries were there, and the United Auto Workers, Steelworkers and
                    Machinists' unions represented them. We had seven breweries in Milwaukee then,
                    each of which left a case of their product on my doorstep at Christmas, and the
                    workers at all of them were represented by one of the more interesting unions in
                    the countrthe Brewery Workers of America, which contained many old German
                    socialists who regularly elected socialist mayors in Milwaukee. And, of course,
                    there were the Teamsters, and I got to know their leadership, including Jimmy
                    Hoffa, as well as dissidents who were trying to democratize that scandal-ridden
                    union. All of that kept me busy. The Milwaukee Journal was one of only a handful
                    of newspapers in the country that had a full time labor reporter on the staff,
                    and that gave me the freedom to become knowledgeable enough about the subject
                    that I was able to create my own schedule of assignments.</p>
                <p>So by doing that, I got to know, or a least to talk to and listen to, such
                    figures as Walter Reuther, George Meany, and the unforgettable David Dubinsky,
                    who was head of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union. He had a thick
                    Yiddish accent, and at the Executive Council meetings in New York, he would come
                    into the press room with a fistful of tickets to the best plays and musicals on
                    Broadway and say “Vich vun do you vant, boys?”</p>
                <p>It was at a UAW convention in Detroit that I met John Reynolds, who was then the
                    Attorney General of Wisconsin, an office his father had held years before. Like
                    most Democrats at that time, he was a former member of the Progressive wing of
                    the Republican Party, who left to revive the nearly moribund Democratic Party of
                    the state because the Progressives could no longer stay in a party that
                    championed the career of Joe McCarthy. Those Progressives included not only
                    Reynolds, but also Gaylord Nelson, who became Governor and then Senator; Patrick
                    J. Lucey, who became Governor, Ambassador to Mexico, and then John Anderson's
                    third party vice-presidential running mate in the 1980 Carter-Reagan election,
                    William Proxmire who took Joe McCarthy's seat in the Senate after McCarthy died,
                    and James Doyle, who became a federal judge and father of the present Wisconsin
                    governor. We were in the suite of the head of the UAW in Wisconsin, Harvey
                    Kitzman, and began a very long, very wet conversation that I think lasted until
                    nearly 3 a.m. He was a most unusual man. There wasn't a clich� in him, and he
                    told me he would run for governor if Gaylord Nelson ran for the Senate, and for
                    the Senate if Gaylord sought another term as Governor. Reynolds was a highly
                    intelligent, warm and generous person, but was not given much chance of higher
                    office because he was not very telegenic, at a time that television was
                    beginning to have a great impact on elections. He had a good voice but a
                    difficult time with some wordnot because of his intelligence, which was
                    exceedingly sharbut because of a dental occlusioanother word he had trouble
                    pronouncing.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Nelson decided to run for the Senate, and Reynolds ran for the Governorship
                    against an attractive Republican businessman who was a heavy favorite. In a
                    tough campaign, Reynolds won by 6,000 votes, but he was the only Democrat
                    elected in that Republican year of 1962. The Attorney General, Secretary of
                    State, Lieutenant Governor and control of both houses of the legislature went to
                    the Republicans. The Governor's term was only two years at that time, and
                    against the opposition of a party that thought his election was a fluke, no one
                    gave Reynolds any hope for a successful term and possible reelection. Reynolds
                    approached me and a very dear friend and colleague, Ira Kapensteialso a Brooklyn
                    bowho was the brilliant political reporter for the Journal. He wanted us to come
                    to Madison as his top aideIra as Executive Secretarnow called Chief of Stafand
                    me as his Press Secretary. We both liked him so much, and were also at that time
                    thinking of moving on to Washington or New York, that we both agreed. But when
                    the editors heard of our plans they offered Ira the Washington bureau, and
                    offered me the Madison bureau, both highly sought after positions. Ira accepted
                    but I decided to go with Reynolds, and became the Executive Secretary..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. How big a change was that in your life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Ultimately it made an enormous difference. I never thought I would
                    leave newspaper worI went with Reynolds because I wanted to see what the reality
                    of government was like behind the official press releases. Reporters never
                    really know for certain when they are being misled, although they're aware that
                    all politicians, lawyers, even public spirited citizens and advocates of noble
                    causes, all have their objectives and want to use you to further their
                    interests. And at the end of my two years with the governor I decided the main
                    thing I had learned was that, to a remarkable extent, the day to day activities
                    of government are shaped by the anticipated reactions of the press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. What kind of person was Reynolds?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: He was the most honest man I have ever known, and perhaps the wisest.
                    He believed that government was good, and he had faith that most people wanted
                    to see it work well and would support good programs if they were fully informed
                    of their purpose.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>In a two year term, a governor can only try to get a budget passed and then start
                    running for re-election. Instead of holding budget hearings with agency heads in
                    Madison, he went out to visit the state institutions and hold hearings at mental
                    hospitals, prisons, universities, and we filmed conditions in some of the most
                    neglected of them. When it came time to present the budget in an address to the
                    legislature, we had a tarp placed over the glass dome of the legislature's
                    chambers and showed the film as he was laying out the reforms that were needed.
                    Two weeks later he was to speak on how the large budget increase would be
                    financed, but after going to the podium he apologized for the difficulty of
                    speaking with a bad cold and shocked me by turning the podium over to me, to
                    read the speech I had written. The plan called for a significant increase in
                    taxes, and if I ever had thoughts of seeking elective office, they probably
                    ended right there. Reynolds had run against the state sales tax. He believed in
                    the teaching of a famous Progressive tax economist at the university, Harold
                    Groves, that all taxes come out of incomincome taxes, sales taxes, property
                    taxes, and even indirectly estate taxeand that the fairest way of distributing
                    the tax burden was through the income tax. The Republican majority refused to
                    pass a budget unless Reynolds accepted a sales tax increase, and eventually a
                    compromise was reached to allocate the increase between the two taxes. In the
                    event, a budget was passed that significantly affected the well being of
                    teachers, the university, improved conditions in the prisons and hospitals, but
                    also gave the Republicans a strong weapon to use against him in the next
                    election.</p>
                <p>But before that, President Kennedy was shot, and it changed everything. Reynolds,
                    along with his close friend and ally, Patrick J. Lucey, chairman of the
                    Democratic Party, had talked Kennedy into running in the Wisconsin Presidential
                    primary of 1960. They revered him, and had asked for nothing in return. Lucey
                    was offered the position of Postmaster General in the new administration.
                    Despite the strong political power of the office at the time, Lucey declined
                    because he didn't want to go to Washington until his business provided the
                    financial independence that he thought was necessary in public life. Dealing
                    with the Johnson White House was very different from the dealings we had with a
                    White House where we really had friends. I had gone to Washington with Reynolds
                    to try to persuade them, at the behest of the Big Ten Universities — who were
                    educating PhD physicists who had to go to Livermore in California or Brookhaven
                    in New York to conduct research — to build a national research facility in the
                    Midwespreferably south of Madison. Reynolds met with Kennedy while I met with
                    Ted Sorenson, Kennedy's top assistant. We had prepared a good presentation,
                    bound it in leather, with a description of the high speed reactor the physicists
                    wanted, all their illustrious names, and the case for helping the Midwest keep
                    the science PhDs that they had trained. Sorenson seemed very interested. When we
                    left the White House Reynolds was walking on air. I asked him: “Did you get it?”
                    He said Kennedy said he'd get it if he could but then said to him: “Now let's
                    talk about something we both know something about; what's the political
                    situation in Wisconsin.?” After Kennedy died, Johnson gave the project to Mayor
                    Daley. It's now at the Argonne National Laboratories in Illinois, associated
                    with the Fermilab nuclear research facility.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Once the budget was passed, we had other adventures. Wisconsin was paying for the
                    construction of its inter-state highways on a pay as you go basis. The state
                    couldn't borrow money under the constitutional provisions at the time, so it had
                    created a separate building commission that could borrow funds for capital
                    construction with the full faith and credit of the state behind it. But the use
                    of the funds was limited to bonds for state office buildings, excluding
                    highways. We tried to put together a bipartisan committee to pass a referendum
                    measure that would allow the state to borrow for highways, arguing that it would
                    not only speed up construction, which was falling behind the pace of neighboring
                    states, but also save money that was being eaten up by inflation. Of course the
                    road builders were all for it, but there was a built in animus in the public
                    that borrowing money in such large amounts was dangerous, even though they of
                    course were borrowing money for their own homes. So the effort failed, despite a
                    long and difficult campaign to win public support.</p>
                <p>Then along came the presidential primary of April, 1964. President Johnson had
                    made it clear he wasn't going to campaign in the primaries, since he felt he had
                    enough support to win the nomination by acclamation, so he asked Gov. Reynolds
                    to run as a favorite son pledged to Johnson. That was the year that Gov. George
                    Wallace of Alabama decided to run in Wisconsin and a number of other northern
                    states to prove his argument that his view of forced integration, disguised as a
                    battle for states' rights, had support in the north as well as in the south.
                    That was a campaign that Reynolds really enjoyed, because he could travel the
                    state espousing a moral cause rather than fighting over budget issues. There was
                    no contest on the Republican side; Sen. Goldwater was unopposed, and the
                    Wisconsin primaries were open, meaning voters could vote in either primary they
                    wished to without declaring a party affiliation. Many Republican voters crossed
                    over to vote for Wallace, either to embarrass Johnson or because they liked
                    Wallace's message. We had anticipated as much, and also were aware that there
                    was disaffection in some of the ethnic, strongly Democratic neighborhoods of
                    Milwaukee over racial issues that could lead to a strong Wallace showing.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>The Governor and I went to Washington to seek some help from the White House, at
                    least to gain some association of the President with the campaign. While he was
                    in with President Johnson, I sat down with Bill Moyers, then Johnson's top
                    assistant. Moyers asked me how many votes we thought Wallace could draw, and I
                    told him it could range from 100,000 to 200,000, probably between 25% and 35% of
                    the vote. He seemed shocked, grabbed a pad on which he wrote down the figures,
                    left me and walked straight into Johnson's office. He came back in a while and
                    asked what we wanted them to do and I told him we really needed a photo of the
                    president and Reynolds together to use in a campaign flyer to demonstrate that
                    Johnson was engaged. On leaving the office and meeting Reynolds with the
                    President in the ante room, a photographer came out and took their photo
                    together. After we returned to Washington I waited for the photo to come while
                    holding up printing of the campaign brochure so that it could be on its cover,
                    but the photo wasn't coming and I began to feel uncomfortable. I suspected the
                    White House felt it was better to let Reynolds take the blame for a possible
                    strong showing by Wallace rather than have the press speculate that it was a
                    sign of the unpopularity of Johnson. I called Moyers and told him that I was
                    getting queries from the press about the absence of any sign of Johnson's
                    interest in the race, and that if we put out the brochure with no photo of his
                    support it could lead to the President being blamed for a strong Wallace vote.
                    We got the photo two days later. Wallace got about a third of the vote, and the
                    press treated it as a Wallace victory. Reynolds was interviewed after the vote
                    by Sandy Vanocur, a first rate correspondent for NBC, who asked him to explain
                    why Wallace did so well. Reynolds' answer cracked Vanocur up. He said: “I've
                    never won an election by such a huge margin in my life!”, and pointed out that
                    he had gotten more votes in the Wisconsin presidential primary than anyone in
                    history, with the exception of FDR.</p>
                <p>And then we had to face the primary election for governor. Thinking Reynolds had
                    been weakened by the presidential primary, Dominic Frinzi, a lawyer in Milwaukee
                    who had defended racketeers, ran against him for the nomination. Again we won,
                    but Frinzi got a lot of votes from ethnic voters on the south side of Milwaukee.
                    This carried over into the general election, eroding the margins we needed from
                    Milwaukee to overcome the expected Republican strength in smaller cities and
                    rural areas. So John was beaten for re-election by 18,000 votes out of a total
                    of 1.3 million cast. Given the significant tax increase he had fought for, that
                    wasn't anything to be ashamed of, even in the year of a Johnson landslide.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Johnson named him to the federal judgeship that had come open in Milwaukee, and
                    he served until he died in 2001. His most memorable decision was ruling in favor
                    of a case brought by a former college roommate of mine, Lloyd Augustus Barbee of
                    Memphis, Tennessee, representing a young black girl and her family who claimed
                    that the Milwaukee schools were segregated by a deliberate designation of school
                    district boundaries. The decision caused an uproar, and Reynolds, using his
                    enormous political skills, diffused it with two actions. First he called upon
                    John Gronouski, our former tax commissioner who had become Kennedy's appointee
                    as postmaster general and then Johnson's ambassador to Poland, to come up from
                    time to time from Austin, Texas where he headed the Johnson School of Public
                    Policy at the U of Texas, and act as referee to see that the decision was
                    carried out. Gronouski's appointment was greeted favorably by the East European
                    population of Milwaukee's south side, who feared that they, rather than the
                    residents of homes in the more expensive northern suburbs, would have the sole
                    responsibility of dealing with the changes to come. Then Reynolds did something
                    truly brilliant. He asked Barbee how much he had been paid during the eleven
                    years in which he had fought doggedly to get the City of Milwaukee into federal
                    court. “Nothing your honor; my clients are not people of means.” Then Reynolds
                    turned to the attorneys from Milwaukee's major law firm and asked them how much
                    the firm had been paid by the city during the two years of the litigation in
                    federal court. “Um, er, 2.5 million dollars.” Reynolds ordered the city to pay
                    Barbee $500,000 for his fee and expenses, thus causing an uproar among the good
                    citizens of Milwaukee so great that they forgot how upset they were at Reynolds'
                    order to integrate the school system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. I take it you came to the Foreign Service after Reynolds'
                        defeat in 1964. How did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The day after the election, my telephone, which normally rang 125
                    times a day, stopped ringing. It was as if the earth stood still. We still had
                    until early January to wrap up affairs and there was much to do, so I started
                    listing all the things in priority order. The list was pretty long before I
                    realized I had failed to list “Look for a New Job.” Just then the phone rang. It
                    was Congressman Henry Reuss, a very respected Democrat from Milwaukee who was
                    chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee, who asked me to come to
                    Washington to work for him as his press secretary. It was a big confidence
                    booster on a bad day, but I knew that I didn't want to slip into a career as a
                    professional staffer. I had worked for the best politician I could imagine, and
                    even then the stress of being responsible for another person's reputation rather
                    than your own, and being controlled by his schedule, was a burden I didn't want
                    to bear for life. I told Reuss I would consider it, but soon after got a call
                    from my friend Ira Kapenstein, who was working for Postmaster General Gronouski
                    as his special assistant, if I would come to work for them. I told him I didn't
                    want a job in Washington, but would like to add to my overseas experience if
                    there were an opening in one of the foreign affairs agencies. He called me back
                    in a couple of days and said he had set up appointments for me with State, AID
                    and USIA, and I came down to Washington a week later.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. And what happened in those interviews?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: It sounded as if AID was a possibility, and State talked about a civil
                    service job in PA, but there was no likelihood of something overseas for the
                    immediate future. At USIA, however, they liked my background in journalism and
                    government and said there was a good chance of what was called a Limited Career
                    Reserve appointment, which meant an appointment for up to five years. I was not
                    even considering that much, but hoped for two to three years of service in a
                    developing country. They said I would have to pass an oral exam administered by
                    three senior Foreign Service officers, and it would take some time to set it up.
                    I told them I would shortly be out of a job, was not a person of inherited
                    wealth, and flying back and forth between Madison and Washington wasn't going to
                    be easy. So they did something very encouraging; they made a few calls and got
                    what I later realized were three outstanding officers together the next day. I
                    spent two hours with them, did the best I could with their very challenging and
                    faranging questions, and went back to Madison. A week later I got a call
                    offering me a job, which I accepted, and a couple of days after that there were
                    three FBI men talking to people in the office and the legislature working on my
                    clearance. Since I had had a top secret clearance from my army days that was
                    only seven years old, my clearance came through quickly and I was sworn in
                    mid-January at the old grade of Class Four (now 2) step 7, which was still below
                    my salary as chief of staff to the governor. But they assured me I'd be overseas
                    before long and the housing allowance would even that all out. They also assured
                    me that, since I was at the top step of Class 4, a promotion to Class 3 wouldn't
                    take long. I had no knowledge of the Foreign Service system, and in fact had to
                    build a record for five years before that happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of assignment were you given.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I was told I was going to Africa. I was sent to see Dan Oleksiw, a
                    legendary guy, huge guy, who was then deputy director for African affairs, and
                    who passed away not long ago after a remarkable career. I entered his office to
                    find him with, two phones to his ears and two conversations going at once. He
                    interrupted both and said, “Oh yes, you. You are going to Nigeria. Go over to
                    the West Africa desk. Work with somebody there. We will put you with someone and
                    you can help them and learn something about Africa before you go. So I said,
                    “Fine.” I went over and I was sent to help David Burns, an experienced officer
                    who was working on West African affairs. I remember one of the first things I
                    was asked to do. There was a forthcoming presidential visit by the unforgettable
                    Maurice Yam�ogo, who was the then president of what was then Upper Volta.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A country that had always been uppermost in your
                        mind.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Of course (laughter). I'd done extensive reading on it over my
                    lifetime. (more laughter.) Yam�ogo was a star at the time because he was
                    outspokenly warning against Chinese incursions in Africa, so he was a great hero
                    to those in the Africa bureau who were concerned about Chinese ambitions in
                    Africa. Burns had a number of West African countries to look after as a desk
                    officer. He said that we really should have a film of Yam�ogo's visit that we
                    can send back to Africa. I was asked to write a treatment of what such a film
                    would consist of. I did, and the film was made, showing the royal treatment he
                    had been given in America. Of course he was deposed not long after he got back.
                    I am not sure if the film got there before he was deposed or not, but it was my
                    introduction to both the Foreign Service and to Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you ever done any film stuff before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Never. All my background was in print media, in newspapers. That was
                    the only thing I ever wanted to do. This was an interlude between the political
                    work that I had done and my planned return to newspaper work. My interest was in
                    getting some additional overseas experience, learning something about the
                    Foreign Service, and perhaps then, together with my German experience, being
                    able to find an overseas assignment with some news organization. In the course
                    of my stay on the African desk, I was regularly getting notices from Personnel
                    that I had been given an onward assignment first to Lagos, Nigeria; then to a
                    new post in Port Harcourt, Nigeria; then to Bamako in Mali, and after a
                    suggestion that it might be Tanzania, finally to Elizabethville in the Congo. I
                    was sent to study French at the Foreign Service Institute. I had had some
                    Spanish and some Russian, but I was not a particularly adept linguist. This was
                    a challenge. I spent five months and got qualified in French. I was to leave in
                    October to go to what was then Elizabethville which, after Maurice Tshombe was
                    deposed by Mobutu, became Lubumbashi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be October '65.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: October '65. They had wanted me to take my first assignment in
                    Washington. I said, “No, that isn't why I came to the Foreign Service. If I
                    wanted a job in Washington I had had offers of several, (including one to work
                    for Sergeant Shriver's new Office of Economic Opportunity), but I had no desire
                    to work in the domestic bureaucracy. They acquiesced, and sent me to Katanga,
                    the former breakaway province of the Congo, as the number two man in a three man
                    information post. That is how important Katanga once was in our plans. I flew
                    into Belgium. I was in the air on my way to Elizabethville, stopping first in
                    Leopoldville, when the then prime minister Moise Tshombe was overthrown.</p>

                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: He had been the president of the short lived Republic of Katanga. I
                    guess in a move to reconcile disparate factions he became the prime minister. He
                    was displaced by Joseph Mobutu. I got to Leopoldville, I stayed a couple of
                    days, and got some briefings. The PAO was a very colorful officer named John
                    Mowinckel, among whose achievements during WW II was liberating the bar of the
                    Hotel Crillon when Paris fell to the Allies...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Along with Ernest Hemmingway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I think Ernest Hemmingway took the Ritz. He took the Ritz and
                    Mowinckel took the Crillon. At any rate I finally arrived in Elizabethville. I
                    remember getting off the plane and by chance, along with the consul, Art Tienken
                    and Ralph Stuart Smith, the PAO, the provincial minister of information was
                    there, and I was introduced. All I could remember to say, after all those months
                    studying French, was “bon jour.” Whatever French I had just disappeared as if
                    you had erased a blackboard. It was not an auspicious start. They took me to a
                    moth eaten hotel, which I got myself out of after one night, and moved into the
                    Grand Hotel Leopold II, which was also in disrepair, but at least I had more
                    than a sheet of cloth for a doorway. I settled in for three months there while I
                    looked for a house. My wife and my two stepchildren were to join me in about six
                    months. I found a house that had been the home of Moise Tshombe's radio
                    operator. There had been a machine gun nest in the back yard which overlooked
                    the river and a badly damaged bridge. The contractor was deepening the machine
                    gun nest and making it into a swimming pool, which could serve as a source of
                    emergency water supply if need ba traditional Foreign Service justification..
                    The house was in an area that the local European residentwho numbered about
                    15,000 at the time — regarded as dangerous because it was across the river from
                    the city proper. But it turned out to be a lovely place, especially once I
                    forced the contractor to abandon his plans to put broken glass on the top of the
                    walls, which was a common feature on the walls of most of the houses lived in by
                    Europeans.</p>
                <p>Elizabethville's name soon changed to Lubumbashi once Mobutu started Africanizing
                    the names of cities in the Congo. There was a Congolese village near us. My
                    stepson Chris was then about eight years old and liked to play soccer. The kids
                    living in the village had some rolled up rags for a soccer ball, and he joined
                    them out in the dusty fields, and they were delighted when we came up with a
                    real ball. We soon became very welcome in the neighborhood. We never had any
                    security problems, but when we left three years later, a Belgian family took the
                    house and they were shortly thereafter found bound and gagged and robbed. We
                    were never touched. At any rate, the post was quite active. There were three
                    daily newspapers in that town, as well as the Official University of the Congo.
                    Most important, and in fact the reason that Lubumbashi existed, was the presence
                    of the Union Miniere, the mining company owned by the Societe General of
                    Belgium, that was the major source of foreign earnings for the Congo, bringing
                    in about 80 per cent of its foreign exchange..</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a copper mine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Copper was the principal product of the mines but there was also
                    cobalt and silver and uranium, and probably other valuable minerals. The uranium
                    for our first atomic bombs came from the Kipushi mine outside of Kolwezi, north
                    of Lubumbashi.. So there was quite a bit to do. Whether there was enough for
                    three people to do was questionable. With my press background I got to meet the
                    people who ran the newspapers very quickly and got along very well with them.
                    Not long after I got there, however, there was a staffing problem in the capital
                    and they wanted to transfer me to Leopoldville. I had just about gotten the
                    house in shape to receive my wife and kids, and I really didn't want to go there
                    because they wanted me to act as assistant information officer. The officer in
                    charge of the information section had come on a direct transfer from Tehran and
                    didn't speak French at all, and by this time after several months, I was fairly
                    comfortable in it. Ralph Smith who had been transferred to the Congo from Paris
                    with his lovely French wife, wrote a persuasive letter to the main post saying
                    that I had started so well that it would be a shame to take me out now. He was
                    so convincing that they decided to reduce us to a two man post, made me the
                    branch PAO, and transferred Ralph back to Washington.' He was delighted. I found
                    myself running the post with no background in the administrative work at all.
                    Luckily the third man at the post was Bob LaGamma, who went on to a terrific
                    career in Africa except for a long stay in Italy. He became a PAO in Nigeria,
                    South Africa, Togo, and Director for African Affairs.</p>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: You should. Bob knew a lot more than I did about Africa. He knew
                    slightly more than I did about administration but neither of us were very
                    familiar with Agency administrative regulations. However we had a first rate
                    Executive Officer in Kinshasa, the new name for Leopoldville, who was Charlotte
                    Loris, who passed away not long ago, who was a great help to us in managing our
                    finances. She also helped us solve a problem we had because there was a very
                    loud bar next to our American Cultural Center, and it would disturb our visitors
                    to the library and our programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The American Cultural center was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The American cultural center was a USIS library. We could hold
                    lectures there. We didn't have a suitable facility for showing films, which were
                    important in Africa. The center of the city was European except for Congolese
                    government officials who lived in good houses We used to take a jeep out to the
                    African living areas that surrounded the city, which contained housing built by
                    the mining company for their workers. We would go out several times a week to
                    different cites, as they were called, in our truck which carried a projector,
                    other equipment, and a generator, and we'd attach a big sheet to a wall. We
                    showed films with three or four thousand people sitting in the square. There was
                    very little other entertainment available to the people in the cites.. There was
                    no television available to them, although there was a tiny station run by the
                    Franciscan fathers that reached houses in the center of town. There was radio,
                    but little else except the bars. They loved the cinema. When we rolled into town
                    kids would run alongside the trucks crying cinema, cinema.!!!</p>
                <p>We wanted to be able to show films in the Cultural Center, but the bar next door
                    was so loud it became impossible to consider. It opened about noon, and by
                    afternoon was a terrible nuisance. We couldn't do anything at night. The
                    landlord of the bar was a Belgian named Mr. Levy, from whom we rented the
                    Cultural Center. I told him it would be a boon to our relationship if we could
                    annex that bar and break through the wall separating the two spaces. We could
                    make it a theater, and because it would be at sort of a right angle to the rest
                    of the library, we could have a sliding wall so we could enlarge the library for
                    a conference area. We worked out an agreement. Charlotte Loris came down to help
                    us negotiate with this Mr. Levy, who was head of the Boy Scouts in Lubumbashi.
                    We reached agreement and took over the bar, and built a very nice little
                    theater.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were our films in French?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Everything was in French. The Congolese spoke, had to actually speak,
                    at least three languages. The Belgians made sure that everybody had at least a
                    third grade education. Some went on further than that. They had to speak their
                    native village language, of which there were some 350 in the Congo. Then they
                    had to speak a vehicular language. The three vehicular languages of the Congo
                    were Swahili, Lingala, and Chiluba. In our area and right up the eastern half of
                    the Congo it was Swahili. And they had to learn French. So the youngest kids at
                    least could get along in three languages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Europeans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The European population was divided almost like guilds. The Italians
                    in town were the contractors, who built the houses and office buildings. The
                    Greeks were smugglers. The Belgians worked for the Union Miniere, the great
                    mining company on which the prosperity of Katanga province and, indeed, the
                    Congo was built. Then, very surprisingly, there was a significant community of
                    Jews who had come down starting early in the century, trailing after an
                    adventurous young man related to them from the Isle of Rhodes. His name was Sol
                    Benatar, who left Rhodes at a very young age and amassed some money selling
                    trinkets to workmen digging the Suez Canal. Then he came down to Elizabethville
                    when the Belgians had discovered the enormous deposits of mineral wealth in
                    Katanga and were building the railroad in from the port of Lobito across Angola,
                    the Benguela railroad.. Benatar bought land, made more money, and eventually
                    started a textile company called Solbena with mills which I believe still exist
                    all over the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering. I have never served in Africa, but I
                        understand most of the stores are little ma and pa stores in much of Africa
                        were Lebanese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: My understanding is that that's true in West and East Africa, but it
                    is less so in Central Africa., although there were some very capable Lebanese
                    businessmen where we were. The Jews were not principally store owners. They were
                    selling goods on a wholesale basis to merchants in the interior of the country.
                    The community grew so large that the Benatars had a synagogue built in 1921 and
                    brought down an Italian rabbi. They were very much part of the community. I
                    imagine the Belgian community there is very scarce now. I really don't know what
                    has happened to them. At the time there were some excellent restaurants in
                    Lubumbashi, and it enjoyed one of the finest climates I have ever lived in,
                    4.000 feet high and nine degrees south of the Equator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. What were your other activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>I originally approached the work down there from the standpoint of my
                    journalistic background, thinking the most important contribution I could make
                    was with the press. But I soon realized the long term effect was going to be
                    realized by whatever contact we could make with the students at the university.
                    They liked basketball, so we put together an American basketball team and played
                    against them. I am not sure whether that helped the relationship along or not.
                    They were tough kids and there were a lot of elbows. I don't know if it was
                    better for us to win or to lose. It cuts both ways. If you lose, you lose
                    something besides the game, since basketball was our game. If you win, you lose
                    something because no one likes to lose. But the students played well and I
                    finally concluded that that was the best outcome; we won, but they were proud of
                    having made it close. And so we played more matches, and we began to establish a
                    good relationship with them.</p>
                <p>We had a Fulbright professor at the university who was quite ineffectual, who was
                    teaching Romance Philology, but we wanted him to teach English. We got AID to
                    put in a tape laboratory into the university, and we started teaching it
                    ourselves. The university was quite open to our participation. There was a
                    Belgian rector and an Italian vice rector. Bob LaGamma and Bob's wife, Anita,
                    who is a wonderful poet, had no children at the time (they have five now), and
                    handled a lot of the teaching. I was also teaching, and we also involved a
                    couple of other people from the consulate. The students were extremely excited
                    about learning English, and we were interested in trying to identify bright kids
                    who we could submit as candidates for graduate study in the United States. You
                    sit in a classroom, and look around and every once in awhile you see a kid whose
                    eyes were shining, who absolutely would just be leaning forward on every word,
                    ingesting everything. We identified eight of those kids and went to the vice
                    rector with a list of those we meant to propose, and he shook his head and said,
                    “You are stealing my diamonds.” So I guess we put our fingers on the right
                    students. As in all cases, not everything turns out as we had planned. Some of
                    those young men who did well went to work not in the Congo, but for
                    international organizations. I am told that some who came back from the various
                    programs we had were not well received when they returned to the Congo. Some did
                    not survive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is always a problem. I mean I saw this in
                        Yugoslavia where doctors would come back with the latest techniques and the
                        doctors in Yugoslavia would try to shove them to one side because they were
                        challenged.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: We discovered a young Italian student who was raised in Elizabethville
                    who was studying physics at Princeton. This was when the Apollo program was
                    being designed, and we invited him to describe the program to the Congolese
                    students..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had better explain what the Apollo program was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The Apollo was a NASA program inspired by President Kennedy's
                    challenge to send men to the moon and return them safely within 10 years. This
                    young man was very conversant with the intricate plan that was being developed.
                    We arranged for a bus load of students to come to the center for this young man
                    to lecture them before a black board and explain to them what the plans were. As
                    he showed the configuration of the plans, the three stage launching, the
                    separation of the lunar module from the mother ship, the landing, the separation
                    of one part of the lunar module from the other, reconnecting with the capsule
                    which would then re-launch itself back to earth, they broke out into peals of
                    laughter. I realize now that the Rube Goldberg nature of that plan would seem to
                    encourage skepticism, and let me tell you these kids were not totally na�ve. I
                    was told by the rector of the university that there was an uncanny ability in
                    theoretical physics among members of the Luba tribe. They would eat up advanced
                    mathematics, calculus and symbolic logic like peanuts. It was a gift. So these
                    were not kids who were necessarily cut off from advanced thinking. But to them
                    at that time they thought it was a joke. Later when we had films to show of the
                    earlier Mercury program and the like, they were enthralled.</p>
                <p>There was something though, when you showed films in Africa, not to these kids
                    but to village people, there were very strange and unanticipated reactions.
                    After Kennedy was shot, we had a prize-winning film that was produced by USIA
                    that was called Years of Lightning Day of Drums. It was shown around the world.
                    At one point in the film there were images of grief-stricken people from around
                    the world reacting to the news of his death. The camera was fixated briefly on
                    an old Greek woman in a black shawl with a very lined face. Invariably the
                    audience would break out into laughter. I asked our projectionist, whose name
                    was Gerard Yumba, why in the world they were laughing at such a sad moment. He
                    said, “Because she is ugly.” In other cases we would show a film where there was
                    a transition of the seasons when leaves would drop from the trees and snow would
                    fall. They had never seen snow for one thing, but they couldn't interpret the
                    falling of the leaves as representing the changing of seasons. Seasons didn't
                    change. It might change from rainy to dry, but leaves didn't fall; snow didn't
                    fall, wind didn't come and blow things away, and so the language of film, the
                    western vocabulary of film didn't make any sense to them. And as it turned out,
                    the Congolese who saw the film, which consisted of the funeral procession to
                    Arlington Cemetery intercut with scenes from Kennedy's presidency, concluded he
                    was truly a great man, because he died and came back to life so many times. We
                    would converse with the agency film division about these things, but they would
                    shrug their shoulders and couldn't handle it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the university. So many universities including
                        our own ended up with sort of a theoretical Marxist faculty or at least
                        significant portions. It seems as if students, this remains the last resort
                        of Marxism. How about that there?</hi>

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: There was a vague collectivist ideology floating around, some of it
                    drawn from the village socialism that was part of African tradition. But it
                    wasn't the kind of systematic Marxism that was found in Latin America. Octavio
                    Paz, the great Mexican poet, once said the only place in the world that Marxism
                    existed was in Latin American universities. But when Mobutu took over, there was
                    a strong transition in the political atmosphere. Young people were sent in to
                    take over the newspapers who were “progressives.” But what “progressive” meant
                    was absolute loyalty to Mobutu, and to a very strident nationalism. They renamed
                    the cities to eliminate the vestiges of colonialism.. Even Mobutu changed his
                    name to Mobutu Sese Sekou followed by a very long series of names that no one
                    could remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Congo became Zaire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The Congo became Zaire, which didn't seem to make any sense at all.
                    Zaire was a river. I am told that Zaire is a Portuguese word, but when the
                    Portuguese first came to west central Africa and came to what is known now as
                    Angola, that territory overlapped with what was then the Kingdom of Kongo. That
                    was the name, and to return to the name of the Congo makes perfect sense.
                    Getting back to your question, it wasn't Marxism as such, but there was a great
                    attraction for what was going on in China, what was going on in the Soviet
                    Union. Lumumba was apparently a Marxist, but you know, it was our coloration
                    really, attempting to throw one blanket over all such political concepts that
                    really led us astray. We sent one very progressive, outspoken, leftist student
                    leader to the U.S. on a student leader grant. He traveled and, when he came
                    back, wrote the most remarkable things in the newspapers. Of course he had some
                    critical remarks to make about the United States, but he described the US as a
                    genuine democracy, where people speak freely and do not get punished for it. He
                    even gave a lecture to his fellow students, some of whom treated his remarks
                    with derision, but others of whom were clearly impressed. I have never since
                    observed such a remarkable payoff from one of our student grants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Why was the Congo such a mess then and now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: It is a huge, wealthy country, and at the time I was there it only had
                    16 million people in an area the size of the U.S. east of the Mississippi River.
                    There are nine different countries on its borders, almost all of which were
                    doing better than the Congo. So it was a source of frustration, and of course
                    everything was usually blamed on colonialism, on the loss of nationhood. But
                    there couldn't have been a strong national identity in the Congo before
                    colonialism since tribal loyalties came first, and in many ways still do. We had
                    a very great interest in making sure it didn't break up and that still remains
                    our principal interest, since it would result in enormous instability in the
                    heart of Africa and have repercussions in every one of the bordering
                    nations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was living there like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: It was usually very comfortable. My kids, then 6 and 8, went to the
                    Lyc�e Kiwele, a school with a student body about half Congolese and half
                    European. Not speaking French, they struggled quite a bit, but working with a
                    tutor after school they managed to squeak through. I found a great difference
                    between the Belgian approach to education and our own because, starting with
                    first grade, each class was assembled at the end of the school year to receive
                    certificates to advance to the next grade. The kids, even at that age, were
                    called up in order of their standing in class. When I went to Belgium on my next
                    overseas assignment, I realized that must have been the explanation for the
                    Belgian driving habits. They had an urge to pass the car in front of them even
                    if there were a solid line of cars on the opposite one lane road, and wherever
                    you were going, you couldn't get there more than ten seconds sooner. But they
                    would risk their lives in the face of an oncoming car in the other lane to gain
                    one car length. I thought it had something to do with being called up in front
                    of their parents to receive their certificate in order of their rank in class,
                    and having to beat out the kid in front of them, that was imprinted firmly on
                    the Belgian driver..</p>
                <p>My wife was pregnant in our second year there, and one of the periodic uprisings
                    in the northeast broke out. The former police of Katanga, the Katangese
                    Gendarmes, had fought the central government during the secession of Katanga
                    from the Congo after independence was declared in 1960, and were suppressed
                    finally by UN intervention. They had been sent by the central government as far
                    away from Katanga as possible, far up into the northeast. But, led by some South
                    African mercenaries, they were making their way back toward Katanga. It was
                    thought that it would be better for us to leave, so I was pulled out a couple of
                    months short of the end of the two year tour and went back to Washington with
                    plans to submit my resignation, along with thanks for a very stimulating couple
                    of years in which I was able to do some traveling in Africa, learn French, learn
                    to appreciate the work that USIA was doing, and it was time to go back to my
                    newspaper career. When I got back to Washington, I told this to David Dubois,
                    who was then deputy director for African affairs and a wonderful gentleman. He
                    said, “Well that doesn't make any sense. You did well there.” At one point I got
                    a commendation for work I did during the blockade placed on Rhodesia, once they
                    announced unilateral independence.</p>

                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: That's right. The copper belt in northern Zambia was cut off from the
                    supplies of fuel needed to keep the mines going. The Anglo-American copper
                    mines, which were more Anglo than American, were in desperate need. It was going
                    to affect world copper supplies and destabilize the Zambian economy. So the US
                    government set up a fuel airlift by chartering one Pan Am 707 and one TWA 707,
                    and flew them down to Kinshasa. Ships would come up the Congo from Matadi on the
                    Atlantic coast carrying drums of diesel fuel. They would be loaded on to these
                    planes, each of which was configured completely, except for the cockpit, to
                    carry cargo. It was 1000 miles from Kinshasa to Lubumbashi. Each of those planes
                    could make three round trips a day. The fuel would be off loaded in Lubumbashi
                    and trucked to the railroad, loaded on railroad flat cars, taken down to the end
                    point in Ndola or Chingola in Zambia, offloaded and sent to the mines. There was
                    a need to make sure that Africans knew what we were doing to help Africa
                    survive, because many of them, particularly in east Africa, were skeptical about
                    our intentions. So somebody in Washington got the very bright idea of taking
                    journalists and politicians from east Africa, but mostly journalists, and flying
                    them to Kinshasa, putting them on the plane to sit in the cockpit because there
                    was no where else to sit, and accompany the fuel to Lubumbashi. I or Bob would
                    meet these journalists at the airport, and take them to dinner, give them a
                    briefing, and we would then get them on the train that was carrying the oil to
                    Zambia. They would see the whole process, and then they would fly back to their
                    home in Kampala or Nairobi or Dar es Salaam. It became quite a chore. I was
                    spending my life at the airport.</p>
                <p>One day a fellow was to arrive who was really more a politician than a
                    journalist, a member of the Ugandan parliament, but he had a newspaper column as
                    well and he talked himself into one of these trips. While he was in Kinshasa,
                    Milton Obote was overthrown as president of Uganda, and this fellow was in no
                    hurry to get back to Uganda until he found out how the dust settled. So I made
                    perhaps four trips to the airport, having being told by Kinshasa each time that
                    he was on the arriving plane. The plane door would open and each time my man
                    wasn't there. We had no telephone communications, so I sent a telegram to the
                    main post saying I really didn't want to go back to the airport again, because
                    it was quite a drive from down town, until I was assured that someone had seen
                    the visitor get on the plane, seen the door close, and the plane taxi out with
                    him on the plane. A couple of days went by and finally I got the telegram saying
                    he was absolutely on the plane and that I could go to the airport without
                    disappointment. He was to arrive at about five or six o'clock in the evening and
                    I went out to the airport. All of us were so fed up with this guy by now that I
                    thought the best thing was to get him back to Uganda as soon as possible.
                    Otherwise I would probably never get him out of Lubumbashi, and if I did, the
                    people in Zambia were going to be driven crazy trying to get him to return from
                    there. As I waited, I spotted a British Air Force plane on the ground. The crew
                    was eating dinner in the airport restaurant and I asked them where they were
                    going. They said to Nairobi. I told them I had a dignitary coming in on this
                    fuel plane that was arriving from Kinshasa at about 5:30, who had to get back to
                    Kampala through Nairobi in a hurry, and asked if they could wait for him. The
                    crew chief said “Well, mate, we don't like to fly over the Rift Valley when it
                    gets dark and it gets dark here you know, by 6:30.” I told them I had been
                    assured he was on the plane, and they agreed to wait.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>At about 5:45 the plane came in, the door opened, and once again he was not on
                    it. The worst thing I had to do was to tell those guys I had made them delay
                    their takeoff for nothing. They didn't say a word; they just walked slowly to
                    the plane and took off as the light was fading. I was furious. I sent off a
                    rocket of a message not only to Kinshasa but to Nairobi and Kampala as an
                    immediate telegram, which has to be opened immediately, even if it meant calling
                    a communicator into the embassy in the middle of the night. Somehow, the
                    distribution got to be Africa wide and I still don't know how that happened.
                    People in communications were awakened all over Africa with my wailing and my
                    insistence that this guy would never see the light of day if he pulled that
                    stunt again. The next week I got a letter from the redoubtable John Mowinckel,
                    who directed USIS operations in the Congo, telling me if I ever sent a telegram
                    like that again I'd get both of us fired. My visitor arrived a couple of days
                    later. I bought him dinner and put him in a hotel. Somehow the train down to
                    Zambia was held up for a couple of days, so we emptied the petty cash drawer,
                    hired a taxi and sent him off to Ndola. I presume he made it.</p>
                <p>Despite my having awakened an entire continent, when I got back home I was
                    congratulated for my work and encouraged to stay for another tour. I was offered
                    an assignment to the US Mission to the European Community, preceded by a year at
                    the Johns Hopkins Center in Bologna to study international economics. I said it
                    sounded wonderful, but I had found that there were no English language schools
                    there, and I couldn't subject my kids to diving into Italian when they had
                    barely acquired enough French. So they decided I could do the work at the School
                    for Advanced Studies of Johns Hopkins here in Washington, and it seemed a good
                    idea to spend a year in Washington improving my grasp of economics, go to
                    Brussels and improve my French, and only then return to journalism. We found a
                    house in Virginia, our daughter Jennifer was born in September, and I spent a
                    very enjoyable year at Johns Hopkins. I spent a lot of time with a wonderful
                    professor, Isaiah Frank, who not only was the man who wrote the basic text on
                    European integration, but was also very interested in developmental economics.
                    There was a lot of reading, a number of papers, but at the end of it, the job at
                    USEC was abolished during a general draw down of overseas personnel for balance
                    of payments reasons. But I still went to Brussels, to the Embassy as Information
                    Officer.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is balance of payments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Balance of payments, that's right. They were eliminating the new job
                    that was being created for me at the Common Market Mission, but they still
                    wanted me to go to Belgium at the embassy, and I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well before we leave this, just a couple of questions
                        about Katanga. You were there before the Shaba business came. There were two
                        invasions of that area by people from I guess the Shaba area.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes, well Shaba was the new name for Katanga. But we had left before
                    the general evacuation of the post because my wife would not have been able to
                    fly if we had waited longer. Bill Harrop was then the consul, having replaced
                    Art Tienken in the middle of my tour. We got on very well. Harrop, as you know,
                    returned at some point as ambassador to the Congo after serving as ambassador in
                    Conakry, and later became ambassador to Nairobi and then Israel. He was very
                    interested in what came to be called public diplomacy, which sometimes works and
                    sometimes fails. There was one of many threats of an attack on Lubumbashi by
                    former Katangese gendarmes from the far north and the Congolese government
                    wanted us to send troops, but President Johnson opted instead to provide
                    American aircraft to move Congolese government forces down from the capital to
                    re-enforce Katanga. The planes, C-130's, would fly in with troops and supplies
                    early in the morning, and leave almost immediately. The local population was not
                    really aware we were doing this, that there was an American presence helping to
                    defend them. So with Harrop's consent I asked the air force guys if they could
                    delay their departure until the African market downtown opened and then come in
                    pretty low so the Congolese could see the American insignia on the planes. It
                    was my introduction to the law of unintended consequences. C-130s flying at a
                    couple of hundred feet make a terrific noise, and the ladies both shopping and
                    selling in the market fled in fear, but as I recall the papers called it a
                    helpful gesture.</p>
                <p>During this period, by the way, we lived under a strict curfew. Everybody was
                    confined to home from 8:00 p.m. until daybreak. Restaurants were going broke. We
                    were told to put American flag posters on our front doors. We were in good
                    standing in the Congo, and an American flag on a car would guarantee easy
                    passage through any blockade. But in this case we were warned, the airport was
                    shut to all white people; no Europeans could go to the airport, and most flights
                    were cancelled. We were in a jam because we had obtained scholarships to
                    graduate school for two of our best students at the University of the Congo in
                    Lubumbashi. We had to get them on a plane to Kinshasa to get on a boat to the
                    States, which was to carry scholarship students from all over central Africa to
                    go to the U.S. I thought this was a nice idea; they could mix and attend
                    lectures preparing them for life in the United States, a nice interlude instead
                    of just flying into a different culture without preparation. As the date for the
                    ship's departure got closer we were getting more and more desperate.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Then we heard a radio report that the curfew had been lifted, and that there was
                    a flight out that day. We picked up the students, who had been all packed and
                    ready to go for days, and loaded them into our office truck and drove out to the
                    airport. Before we got there we were stopped at a military blockade. I remember
                    the young soldier who was aiming the biggest handgun I have ever seen directly
                    at my head. What worried me most is that his hand was shaking. Luckily, both of
                    the students came from the north, where the soldiers came from, and spoke
                    Lingala along with the local language of Swahili. The students gradually talked
                    him down, and he finally put his gun away and, with misgivings, let us proceed.
                    The chief of security for the region was a man named Stanley Mika. When
                    journalists used to come down during the occasional periods of stresI remember
                    that Anthony Lewis of the New York Times came down once — I would brief them and
                    help them get in touch with the appropriate people. Lewis asked me what the
                    usual drill was, and I told him that he would meet with people in the governor's
                    office, at the Union Mini�re, the Belgian consulate and the US consulate, and
                    pretty soon he would be picked up and arrested. Then Stanley Mika would come and
                    get him out of jail and take him home for dinner. That was exactly his
                    experience. Anyway I get out to the airport with these kids and take them to the
                    plane and get them on, and Mika comes over to me. He said, “What are you doing
                    here?” I said, “Well there was an announcement that the airport was open.” “The
                    airport is only open to Congolese”, he said. “All of my men have orders to shoot
                    to kill.” So that was probably as close as I came to trouble, although I still
                    find it hard to believe that that young soldier would have followed that order,
                    because there was still a post-colonial mentality in the country, and there was
                    a tendency to associate white people with authority. So not being confident of
                    what to do without a senior officer around, he probably wouldn't have been able
                    to carry that out. At least I like to hope so. But the persuasiveness of the
                    students was undoubtedly the deciding factor.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned you found that radio, film projections and
                        teaching at the university were key means of reaching your contacts. What
                        was the problem with the press?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Oh it wasn't very professional. One of the papers had a Belgian
                    journalist down there as an advisor who tried to develop some journalistic
                    professionalism. But the level of journalism was very parochial. Although they
                    had a reasonable audience, with three papers in a town of a couple of hundred
                    thousand people, circulation was restricted to interested Europeans and the
                    small percentage of educated Congolese who occupied the political and
                    administrative levels. For working class Congolese, even literate ones, buying a
                    newspaper was a luxury, and radio was by far the main source of information
                    among all, probably including the political elite. As a consequence none of the
                    papers could make any money. They were largely supported by political factions
                    or businessmen, and perhaps by some of the consulates. Congolese music was
                    popular all over Africa and you heard it on radios all over the center of the
                    town and in the citethe towns surrounding the center of the city built by the
                    Union Miniere to house their workers. Strangely enough there was a very good
                    classical music station as well, run by monks of the order of St. Francois
                    DeSalle. There was a polio outbreak in the 1950's when all the schools were
                    closed and the school run by the Franciscan fathers inaugurated a radio station
                    and started conducting classes on the air. Its founder was a wonderful monk
                    named Pere Richard, and after the polio crisis had passed he continued to
                    operate the station with good music and news. It was a little island of the
                    western world in the heart of the Congo, and was a good source of information.
                    We picked up VOA of course, and BBC. The French had a strong signal coming in
                    from Brazzaville, and the Paris Herald Tribune came in a couple of days late.
                    Together with our cable traffic and the Wireless File we kept pretty well in
                    touch with events. At one point the Franciscans put together a six, not 60 not
                    600, but a six watt television station that could cover the center of town. They
                    began to broadcast films that they were getting from the French embassy, and we
                    began to offer films from our own library. Interestingly they reached a lot of
                    African officials who immediately had television sets shipped in from either
                    Belgium or Zambia. But most of our film activity was sending those crews in our
                    jeep to the cites. It was the only entertainment, beside drinking and dancing,
                    that they had.</p>

                        influence there, and I think helped Mobutu. Did you find that the CIA
                        influence penetrated to what you were doing and that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Not much. We were good friends with the representative there, as one
                    would expect in a small post. I probably helped him more than he could help me,
                    just by the contacts we had in the university and by giving him some idea of
                    what was going on there or among the media. But I was very hesitant to turn over
                    any contacts to him. USIA drew a pretty firm line as far as providing any kind
                    of cover. I guess there had been some in the past, but if there had been any
                    kind of justified suspicion on the part of journalists or the university faculty
                    that we were in fact not what we seemed to be, we would lose all influence and
                    credibility. The credibility I had with the press came from their knowledge of
                    my past newspaper experience. I knew what their problems were and what they were
                    dealing with. They were putting out a newspaper under roughly the same
                    conditions that we put out our student newspaper at the University of
                    Wisconsin.</p>

                        Right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Exactly, yes. It was a broad spectrum of courses on Atlantic issues,
                    focusing on European integration, but also on political and national security
                    issues. I didn't seek to matriculate for another master's degree, because I
                    didn't want to spend a lot of time in the language lab. But it was very useful.
                    I had taken some economics in college, but learning more about balance of
                    payments issues, about the mechanics of European integration, the history of it,
                    that was new to me. That was very helpful. And I had the great good fortune of
                    spending a good deal of time with Prof. Isaiah Frank, who had worked at State
                    for a while as deputy assistant secretary for economic affairs, and who was a
                    very wise man. He had written some basic texts on European integration, and was
                    also very well informed on issues of economic development. Most of what I
                    learned at SAIS I learned from him.</p>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well it was a prerequisite for participation in the Marshall Plan. The
                    whole purpose of the Marshall Plan was, while rebuilding Europe, to encourage
                    the breakdown of commercial barriers and the growth of continent-wide
                    cooperation.</p>

                        this, were questions raised or was thought given OK, this thing might become
                        really successful, and might end up as a power unto itself, another European
                        power which could rival us in I am thinking economic commercial terms. Was
                        that at all considered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Certainly there was that consideration, but I think the overwhelming
                    point of view of the American government, and I think this was common to both
                    parties, was that the breakdown of economic barriers and the strengthening of
                    European confidence would make another European conflict far less likely. And
                    also that Europe would be a better partner when we could negotiate with it as
                    another great power, rather than have to deal with the prickliness of individual
                    states that felt they were in a subordinate position in negotiating with a great
                    economic power like the United States. Dealing as equals, it was thought, would
                    be far more conducive to good commercial relations.</p>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Oh yes. We had a mission to USEC, the US Mission to the Common Market
                    headed by Ambassador Robert Schaetzel, and a mission to NATO headed by
                    Ambassador Harlan Cleveland, and we had a mission of course to Belgium headed at
                    that time by Ambassador Ridgeway Knight. We had a three man USIS post at the
                    Embassy, although our local staff helped us carry out administrative support for
                    the USIS posts supporting USEC and NATO. At times I was asked to go over and
                    help out at NATO when our mission was short-staffed during a conference, usually
                    to cover the event and write a story for world-wide distribution on the Wireless

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: There was only one presidential visit while I was in Belgium, but that
                    was a big onPresident Nixon's first stop on his first trip abroad as President.
                    It taught me a great deal about the needs of the traveling White House press
                    corps, and it went off quite well. That was in 1969 and Nixon was greeted quite
                    warmly by the Belgian press. We were worried on his arrival when he casually put
                    his arm across the back of King Baudouin, who had greeted him at the airport, as
                    they walked to the reviewing stand. It was a front page photo in the major
                    newspaper, and to our relief the caption said that the President had engaged in
                    a “typically warm American gesture of friendship” rather than treating it as an
                    inappropriate act. Later on I was asked to go to Ireland to assist in working
                    with the press on Nixon's visit there, with Tom Tuch coming from Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. What does one do to please the White House press?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The principal tasks are ensuring that they have a good place to work,
                    all the facilities they need to move their stories, and access to all but the
                    most private events, such as meetings between the President and the Belgian
                    Prime Minister. This was before computers so that stories were generally filed
                    by telephone or telex from the press center. Today they would do it by a direct
                    feed from their computers to the newsroom. But in those days we had to have a
                    huge room for more than 200 newsmen with ample phone banks and several telex
                    companies ready to move their stories. We also had to have a schedule for the
                    newsmen mirroring the President's own schedule, buses to take them where the
                    President would be exactly when he got there, and access for photos to all
                    events. If the press was unhappy, the White House would be unhappy, but from all
                    reports both the press and the President's party went away pleased.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q. And what were your major concerns? Belgium was a

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes, but remember this was during the Vietnam war, and while a good
                    number of Belgians remembered our role in liberating them during World War II,
                    and gave us the benefit of the doubt, the younger people were very opposed to
                    our policies. In fact, they seemed to be taking their cue from the behavior of
                    people of their same age in the US and elsewhere. The Soviet invasion of
                    Czechoslovakia in 1968 was a blow to the left in Belgium and elsewhere, but it
                    did little to allay concern about Vietnam. We also had problems from our
                    friends, who on the one hand were afraid that we were neglecting European
                    security needs by getting caught up in a part of the world that was of less
                    interest to them than it was to us. On the other hand our departure from Vietnam
                    would certainly cause them to be concerned about our reliability should we be
                    needed to defend Europe. There are some situations that are just
                    intractable.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Was the press hostile on the Vietnam issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Not uniformly. The Belgian press represented virtually all shades of
                    political expression, and we had good relations with all of them. The Socialist
                    Le Peuple was among our good friends despite differences over Vietnam
                    especially, but their criticism was never cutting. That was one of the benefits
                    of the tendency of Belgian institutions, that they were typically headed by
                    people of a certain age. They had memories of when we were really needed. My
                    major problem was with television, which had two branches. RBT was the Flemish
                    channel, and they were generally very supportive. RTB was the French language
                    channel, and they were the scene of bitter battles among pro-and anti-American
                    factions. The best friend I had in Belgium was Henri Francois van Aal, who was
                    the host of the Belgian equivalent of 60 Minutes. They called it Neuf Milliothe
                    Belgian population at the time was nine million. He was a very professional
                    newsman, who later became Minister of Francophone Cultural Affairs, but while he
                    was at RTB he treated us very fairly. We were able to help him become the first
                    foreign TV newsman to win a Neiman Fellowship at Harvard, and the Fulbright
                    Foundation in Belgium was able to help finance it. Unfortunately the person who
                    became RTB's “expert” in US affairs was a fellow named David Lachterman who was
                    truly expert in producing programs about the US that cleverly used material
                    appearing in the US that was self-critical, without any balance by material
                    showing, without cynicism, healthy aspects of our society. An example was the
                    CBS program “Hunger in America” that showed American audiences something that
                    shocked them because most Americans were not as aware as they are now of the
                    pockets of extreme poverty that led some families to live in actual hunger.
                    Belgian audiences, however, were less sure that they knew as much as they might
                    about the real America, and the program had a greater affect there than it did
                    in the US, because it called into question the image of America that they had
                    seen in movie theaters. So we did battle for three years with RTB, winning some
                    and losing some, but overall we made a dent. Our space program was, of course,
                    of major interest in Belgium as it was everywhere. The Apollo 11 astronauts came
                    to visit and the Belgian foreign ministry and the city of Brussels agreed on a
                    triumphal motorcade from the airport to the Palace. We were worried about making
                    sure there was a good turnout on the streets, and went to RTB with the route
                    map. They surprised us by taking a camera mounted on a car to show the entire
                    route on their widely watched evening news show the evening before the event.
                    The next day the motorcade route looked like motorcades of Lindbergh's return
                    from his Paris flight or of Eisenhower's triumphal return from Europa parade I
                    witnessed as a child.</p>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: It did, but a career in the Foreign Service didn't seem likely given
                    my earlier work in Democratic politics. I was serving on a five-year appointment
                    as a reserve officer and that would end no later than the end of my posting in
                    Brussels. But it was announced that the administration had decided to change the
                    nature of the USIA Foreign Service by giving its members the title of Foreign
                    Service Information Officers and the stability that the State Department Foreign
                    Service enjoyed. The granting of career status would be determined by interviews
                    with each officer by senior panels. I was sure there wouldn't be room for me,
                    since it would provide an opportunity to get rid of people who might have gotten
                    hired because of their Democratic political connections.</p>
                <p>I was vacationing with the family in Italy when I got a message telling me to fly
                    to Frankfurt to be interviewed by the panel that had been sent to Europe. I had
                    to fly from Ancona to Rome and than up to Frankfurt and got in late, but the
                    panel was kind enough to give me more time to get to the Consulate. I was
                    subjected to a long and thorough interview, and I think I enjoyed good luck
                    because the other people they had interviewed that day were young officers whose
                    early tours had been in Sweden, Paris, and other European posts. I guess my
                    Congo tour must have impressed them, and I didn't go out of my way to talk about
                    the nice golf course or the good food and weather. Not long after I returned
                    from vacation I was offered career status, and I was impressed by the fact that
                    my political background had not been a barrier. We decided that the work I was
                    doing gave me more time with my family than either politics or journalism ever
                    would, and I was interested in the work. By this time I had become really
                    involved and deeply absorbed. I was also mindful of my tendency to get bored
                    with being in one place too long, and thaunless I was working for a newspaper
                    with multiple bureauI would want to change jobs every few years. The Foreign
                    Service allowed you to change scenery radically, to experience a dramatic
                    cultural change every few years, without ever giving up your seniority. It was
                    just unique in that respect.</p>

                        first time as president. He had been vice president of course. Usually the
                        staff around, particularly early on, is both amateurish and demanding. How
                        did you find this from the presidential staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well, the first thing that happens to you is the White House takes
                    over your life. They move in, and there is somebody assigned to the task of
                    coordinating the public affairs side of it on the White House part and on our
                    side. On our side, I was given the responsibility, reporting to our wonderful
                    PAO Ed Brooke, of doing the basic liaison with the White House people and with
                    the Belgian foreign ministry, usually in the company of Ambassador Knight and
                    Embassy political, administrative and security people. They determined that the
                    Hilton Hotel would be the headquarters, and we went over there with the
                    administrative people from the embassy to work out the logistics of the press
                    center. I pretty well knew what the press needed, where television cameras
                    should go, where you could allow still photographers to go, where the writing
                    press would go. I urged, successfully in that case, that the press center be
                    joint, that the American press and the foreign press should share the same
                    quarters. As time went on, the American government backed away from that because
                    of complaints from the American press. I thought it was a big mistake, because
                    the US press, particularly the TV prima donnas, often left a bad taste in the
                    mouths of the local newsmen, and limiting our press center to US media could
                    only color the press coverage in the press of the host country in a hostile
                    direction. But the White House press office's major concern was, of course, how
                    the President was treated by the American media, and we were left to pick up the
                    pieces after the circus left town. In Nixon's visit to Belgium, however, that
                    wasn't the case, and the local press coverage was excellent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Belgian Foreign Ministry people react to our
                        requirements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The White House people would insist on priority treatment for the
                    press. For instance there was one part of the visit where the President would
                    lay a wreath at the Belgian tomb of their unknown soldier, which is located at a
                    very narrow, crowded area of the historic district of Brussels. The need was to
                    maneuver the buses carrying the press so they could get the best pictures
                    possible of Nixon laying the wreath. But there were crowds across the street
                    behind barriers who would be witnessing the ceremony, and moving the buses to
                    provide for our press would block their view. So what we devised was a system
                    where we would be able to move the buses in just after the wreath was laid and
                    before the president moved away, so the photographers could get their shots.
                    There was also a press and photo pool close to the President so that should have
                    been enough, but there was another reason to move those buses quickly. We had to
                    get them to the next site, perhaps a couple of hundred meters away, where the
                    president was going into the palace with King Baudouin. It was at that point in
                    our discussions that my counterpart in the Belgian Foreign Ministry, press
                    spokesman Jean Francois de Liedeclerq (who had a son born the same day as my son
                    David in the same hospital, the Clinique Edith Cavell) made a wonderfully
                    accurate observation. He said in front of the Ambassador, the Foreign Minister,
                    the White House people and everybody else: “You know, I have just come to
                    realize the difference between the American approach to such visits and our
                    approach. We will permit any role for the press that does not interfere with
                    protocol. You will permit any roll for protocol that does not interfere with the
                    press.” That is a constant where ever you go, no matter which party controls the
                    White House.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>A year later, when President Nixon was making a visit to Ireland after leaving
                    the Soviet Union, I was asked, because we had no USIS post in Ireland, to
                    provide press support along with Tom Tuch coming from Berlin and a young officer
                    from Vienna. Congressman Rooney, who ruled over our budget for a long time said,
                    “We don't need a USIA mission in Ireland. We don't have any enemies in Ireland.”
                    He was probably right. I was tasked to go to Limerick where the press and White
                    House party would overnight before going to Dublin. We had to look for a place
                    to put 220 newsmen. There was no really suitable place. There was a beautiful
                    hotel that was built by an expatriate Irish-American who had returned to
                    Ireland, bought Dromoland Castle, and built the Clare Inn. But they wouldn't
                    give him a liquor license for the Clare Inn, and he refused to open it until
                    they did. So we negotiated with the county, and they gave him a liquor license
                    for one night. So he stocked the bar and then he brought in all the new help.
                    Nobody had worked there before; it had never been opened. We had the bar opened
                    at least for the reporters since there was nothing else to do in Limerick. But
                    there was a to do because the White House reporter for the New York Times, Max
                    Frankel, later its editorial page editor, wrote a brilliant series of limericks,
                    datelined Limerick, about the Nixon trip. They were hilarious, and the piece
                    circulated around the bar. Much of it was focused on the staff's search for the
                    birthplace of Nixon's putative Irish ancestor, which was thought to be a place
                    called Timahoe. The problem was that they found two Timahoes, and arbitrarily
                    chose one for the Presidential ancestral home. President Nixon's staff saw the
                    piece and didn't like it at all, and to my surprise they succeeded in convincing
                    the Times not to publish it. We left the Clare Inn and flew to Dublin the next
                    morning where there was a parade during which someone threw an egg at Nixon and,
                    by the grace of God, missed. We got to the airport without further incident. Now
                    the night before, a dinner for the press was thrown at the Dromoland Castle by
                    the man who also owned the Clare Inn. People had their choice of going to an
                    Elizabethan dinner served by ladies dressed in Elizabethan costumes with all
                    that they revealed, or to an old Irish country dinner. Well I went to the
                    country dinner with some of the press, and other people went to the other
                    dinner, and somehow I got very sick the next morning. I was in extreme distress
                    on the motorcade going to the airport. I could barely make it until the
                    President left. I went back to the hotel and was really having very a bad case
                    of dysentery, worse than anything I had had in the Congo except for one bout of
                    salmonella. I couldn't go to a farewell dinner that was being held for us that
                    night at the Russell Hotel, thrown by its manager.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>As it turned out, I missed a great dinner but I learned a lesson that served me
                    well for years. I called the front desk and asked if they had a doctor in the
                    house. This was in the Gresham Hotel, a beautiful old Edwardian hotel in Dublin.
                    The desk clerk said, “Well Dr. Murphy is our doctor, but he is not here now,
                    what is your problem? Maybe I can help you.” I described my condition, and she
                    said “Well I know what he does in these cases. I will leave word with him, but
                    until he comes, do you trust me to give you his treatment?” I said, “I would
                    trust anybody right now.” She said, “Get undressed; get into bed.” Shortly there
                    was a knock on the door; she came in trailed by a waitress with a very large
                    tray, and on it were two bottles of, as it turned out, room temperature 7-Up,
                    two goblets, a canister, a silver bowl of sugar, a salt shaker and two hot water
                    bottles. She opened one of the cans of 7-Up and poured it into the goblet. She
                    put in two teaspoonfuls of sugar and shook some salt in and stirred it up. Then
                    she put a hot water bottle on my stomach and a hot water bottle on my feet. She
                    said, “Now you are to resist going to the bathroom as long as you can. Slowly
                    sip this 7-Up and then fill it up again after you finish and try not to go to
                    the bathroom.” I tried to follow her instructions as best I could, but I didn't
                    survive very long. I had to go to the bathroom. I drank more 7-Up. This time I
                    held out for maybe 15 minutes, and continued drinking the 7-Up mixture. There
                    was a knock on the door, and the waitress came in, replaced the hot water
                    bottles and left two more cans of warm 7-Up.. I continued the process until,
                    after another half-hour, I was totally free of my ailment.</p>
                <p>The phone rang and it was Dr. Murphy. He said, “How are you doing my boy?” I
                    said, “I'm doing fine and I don't know why. I have had all kinds of cures for
                    this condition but this one doesn't seem very scientific.” “Oh yes,” he
                    answered, “this is very scientific. Dysentery is a vicious cycle. You have got
                    an irritation in the bowel that forces the release of liquid. The more you lose
                    the more you have to go to the bathroom. It's a vicious cycle that has to be
                    broken. So we give you a bland liquid like 7-Up. We put some sugar in there
                    because you have lost a lot of strength. That releases the carbonations also, so
                    the carbon dioxide won't be an irritant. We put some salt in so you will retain
                    the fluid. The hot water bottle on your stomach relaxes the cramps and help you
                    resist going to the bathroom.” I said, “Well it makes great sense, but what
                    about the hot water bottle on my feet?” “Oh,” he said, “me mother always did
                    that.”</p>
                <p>I have used that cure whenever I have been afflicted again, and it has always
                    worked.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were in Brussels from '68 to '71. You certainly

                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: It was contentious, but we were not the subjects of large scale
                    demonstrations. We were criticized in the press. There were the same images on
                    Belgian television that were seen here in the States. Yet I think Belgian
                    feelings were tempered. The conservative party, in this case as elsewhere in
                    Europe called Liberals, was strong in Belgium, and I was once told by the editor
                    of Le Peuple, the Socialist newspaper, that all Belgians were basically
                    conservative. He said “We have Conservative conservatives, Socialist
                    conservatives, and even Communist conservatives, but we are all basically
                    restrained in our behavior, except when it comes to the linguistic divide.”</p>
                <p>So while Belgians were generally critical of our actions in Vietnam, their real
                    fear was that our strength was being squandered on a war that didn't really
                    threaten our interests, which they, of course, felt should be centered on the
                    defense of Europe. At the same time, many also would react to our defeat in
                    Vietnam by a loss in confidence that they could count on us to defend them in
                    case the Russians came westwards. Nevertheless, there were still enough people
                    around who remembered WWII. Any taxi driver immediately, when he discovered you
                    were American, started talking about the kids who demonstrate on the university
                    campuses. “They don't understand. They weren't around during the war. They don't
                    know how we would be living now if it wasn't for the Americans.” So it was a
                    period of declining popularity, but there was still, even among the younger
                    people, an identification with the rebellious spirit among young Americans, the
                    same identification that they had with the French youth during the 1968
                    demonstrations there. I remember seeing the film MASH with French sub-titles and
                    not being able to hear the English dialogue because of the constant laughter and
                    applause of the young people in the audience and having to depend on the
                    subtitles to know what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a series about a military hospital in Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Not the television show, the film. The film came out in '69 or
                    '70.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '69. I saw it in Saigon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I'm surprised the Army showed it to the troops in Saigon. The Belgian
                    kids loved it. They loved it for its irreverence, and the fact that the
                    Americans were criticizing their own war, that there was debate in America. Most
                    of the tenor of the debate was identified as opposition from American sources,
                    so they never lost respect for American democracy. They never were confused by
                    the fact that American society was divided on the war. The Belgians didn't like
                    the war for different reasons; the kids for one reasoour interference in what
                    they thought was a war of national independence —, and the older people for
                    reasons I've described. But they did not respond, for the most part, in the same
                    way as was the case either in the Netherlands, France, or even in the United
                    States.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I think to some extent yes. They were different not so much in what
                    they thought but in how they expressed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the University or universities? Did you get into
                        them? You know some places the universities in Europe particularly after '68
                        which had stirred things up. It wasn't just anti American, so it meant that
                        the left had sort of taken over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The Free University of Brussels was that kind of institution at the
                    time. It didn't mean that we were forbidden from being on campuses, but we were
                    more welcome at the University of Louvain, or Leuven in Flemish, where the
                    university was located. We had many opportunities to be there and we
                    co-sponsored with their international affairs department a number of very good
                    seminars on international affairs. We also had no problem reaching the press
                    with serious seminars. We had a seminar for political writers on American
                    elections before the 1970 mid-term vote. We didn't have access as yet to
                    videotape, but we asked USIA to make kinescopes of a number of the Sunday talk
                    shows and of the ads that would be used in the congressional campaigns. We had
                    about 20 journalists in attendance for two days, with a mix of speakers and
                    films, and even the leftist press came. We had good relations with all elements
                    of the press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Belgian communist party How did we view it
                        and deal with it or not deal with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The Belgian communist party was almost invisible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't like the 27% or something in France?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Oh no, because there were strong socialist parties on both sides of
                    the language divide. There was a Flemish socialist party and a Walloon socialist
                    party. They were social democrats, social Christians, a Catholic party. They
                    pretty much soaked up the energies of the left. The problem was that Belgium had
                    this language problem, and it was by far and away the greatest focus of
                    political energies. It wasn't left and right; it was Dutch and French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find was it kind of almost the way it was in
                        Canada where you had to make sure that you touch both bases on everything

                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your employees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: They were very mixed, but you know, many Flemish names belong to
                    French speakers and French names belong to Dutch speakers. Some leading French
                    language TV journalists had Flemish names, like Henri Francois van Aal or Luc
                    Vendeweghe. And the reverse was true in the Flemish language TV. There was a
                    great deal of hypocrisy involved. The extremes got people stirred up. I think it
                    eventually colored the entire political spectrum. It was tearing things apart.
                    Neighborhoods were torn apart. This neighborhood would have to be Flemish and
                    that neighborhood would have to be French. And some of the conflict arose not
                    just out of language per se, but because there was apparently more collaboration
                    on the Flemish side with the Germans during the war than by the French speakers,
                    although I believe there were Belgian Nazis of both communities who formed units
                    to fight on the side of the Germans on the eastern front. But the language
                    battle was a fight in which we had no dog, yet it was a huge distraction. The
                    real battleground for us was television because RTB, the French language
                    television, produced the most effective anti-American content, although we also
                    had friends in both their documentary and news divisions of RTB. The Flemish
                    language television was far more pro-American; in fact much of their programming
                    was American sitcoms in English with Flemish subtitles. Their news programs were
                    generally professional and straightforward, as, for that matter, was true of the
                    RTB newscasts. It was the occasional documentary in the hands of one of the
                    firebrands that gave us problems, far more so, than any of the political
                    parties.</p>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Home grown.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes, it was more driven, surprisingly, by lingering anti-German
                    feelings. The leading anti-American TV film maker was the son of Jewish
                    refugees, who was motivated by his hostility to the American re-arming of
                    Germany.</p>

                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: A little, but of not real consequence. I was once invited to a Soviet
                    cocktail party and went with Henri Francois van Aal. It was the strangest
                    reception I've ever attended. There were these security goons around the edges
                    of the room. They could have had signs on their heads saying KGB. Van Aal picked
                    it up immediately There were some Russian press and Embassy people who were
                    being watched closely by the goons, who held glasses from which they never
                    drank. The host was the Soviet press attach�, a rather decent man, who was
                    clearly embarrassed. The Soviets tried to influence the press by appealing to
                    the Belgian spirit of fairness, since we obviously had a lot more influence. And
                    strangely the Cubans apparently were active, but didn't seem to have much
                    success at all. They were out of their familiar water.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what happened. I mean did it have any effect on your
                        work or anything in September of '68 when the Soviets and others in the
                        Warsaw Pact went into Czechoslovakia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Oh yes. Probably the most successful political film that USIA ever
                    made was a film called Czechoslovakia 1968. It came out the following year. It
                    was wordless. It was a mixed series of slides and film showing the history of
                    Czechoslovakia from the birth of the nation, the pre-war years, the crush of
                    Hitler's boot, the joy of the liberation, the re-birth of life, the
                    Communization, the Czech Spring and then, finally, the entry of the Soviet
                    tanks. It was one of the few films that we produced that we were able to place
                    on Belgian television. The Czechoslovakian episode was devastating, a
                    devastating black eye for the Soviets. Reaction to it was as bad or even worse
                    than Belgian reaction to our involvement in Vietnam because it was closer to
                    home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, you are thinking about this. This is the time
                        after the '68 invasion of Czechoslovakia. An awful lot of the
                        “intellectuals” in France peeled off from the Soviet cause. Was there an
                        equivalent intellectual group in Belgium and if there was, how did you deal
                        with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The Belgian Communist party was such a non-entity that no one cared.
                    Belgian Socialists were not at all pro Soviet. I think the Khrushchev
                    revelations of the Stalin era had more to do with the loss of any remaining
                    illusions about the Soviet Union than the Czech fiasco. It didn't take
                    Czechoslovakia to do that but it was obviously an embarrassment. We didn't have
                    to exploit it; the Belgians did a good enough job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Belgium they didn't have the same powerful intellectual
                        group that they did in France.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: There were of course people in the universities, and commentators in
                    the press and well known writers who were leftists. But I just don't think they
                    had the institutional framework that made a pro Soviet point of view meaningful
                    in Belgium. There were some of them in influential roles, but there never was a
                    feeling that Belgium was ripe for subversion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then in '71 you left, and what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well I had always wanted to go to Asia and I was offered a job in
                    Korea by John Reinhardt, who was Director for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and
                    later, in the Carter administration, became director of USIA. It was more than
                    an offer; I was sent orders to go as press officer in Korea. So we went back
                    home for home leave, visiting my sister in Dallas and then undertaking the very
                    long trip to Seoul with by now four children. My son, David, was born in 1970 in
                    Brussels, by now Jennifer was 3, Julie was 11 and Chris was 13. So with four
                    children and 16 pieces of luggage we flew first to Washington and then Dallas,
                    and then after a week or so on to San Francisco and Tokyo where we finally spent
                    the night. Then we left for Seoul where we were met at the airport with two vans
                    to transport us through this incredibly different human and urban landscape than
                    any I had ever been in. What came to mind was the old comic strip Terry and the
                    Pirates. We were driven through these dusty back streets to an approach to the
                    living compound adjacent to the US military base in Yongsan, at the southern end
                    of the city. As we approached we were struck by a pungent odor, which came from
                    a large truck into which muscular men stripped to the waist were emptying honey
                    buckets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Honey being manure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes they were collecting the human excrement which, I was told, was
                    used as fertilizer by farmers. To leave this scene and enter through the gates
                    of a small American town with neat lawns and tidy ranch houses was a dramatic
                    transition. We were taken to a four bedroom, furnished concrete block house
                    built by AID some time before. It was basic housing, but pleasant and very
                    livable. It was fun, although very different from the lovely house we occupied
                    in Brussels on Avenue Pere Agniello near a church square called Chante de
                    Oiseasong of the bird, whose other name was Vogelgesang, same meaning in
                    Flemish. There was a bakery around the corner and a wonderful cheese shop, and
                    here, just a few weeks later, we found ourselves in this compound off the
                    military base with a maid and gardener waiting for us, and we settled in.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>We found the place was furnished. I soon got my first taste of what I came to
                    realize was the incredible self-confidence of Koreans. In the shipment of our
                    household goods that was eventually unloaded, we had made the mistake of
                    shipping a washer and dryer to Korea, not having been informed that there were
                    appliances in the house. But they unloaded the washer and a small but essential
                    piece had broken off during the shipment, the balancing piece of hard rubber
                    which kept the rotating barrel stable. The GSO was there and said, “Oh we are
                    going to have to send for this part to General Electric. It will take about
                    three months. We will lend you a washing machine in the meantime.” While this
                    was being discussed the Korean who was unloading the shipment picked up the
                    broken piece and told the embassy translator that he had a friend who could make
                    a part like this. I asked the price, and the answer was “A dollar.” “How soon?”
                    “Tomorrow.” The next day he came back with the part. They had made a sand mold
                    of the part, poured the rubber, and it fit. We put it in and it worked. I didn't
                    realize at the time that it was a foretaste of what Korea was to become.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Korea from '71 until?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: '73.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing? What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well there was an information officer and a press attach�. I was the
                    press attach�. They did away with the information officer's job when he retired
                    and gave me both jobs. Korea was in a period of repression during the Park Chung
                    Hee regime that was particularly difficult for the Korean press. I was at a
                    disadvantage because I did not speak Korean. I wasn't given Korean language
                    training, except for some lessons I took early each day in my office in order to
                    learn some basic phrases and to be able to give directions to taxicab drivers,
                    but reporters and editors almost uniformly in those days spoke English. Most of
                    them had worked in one way or another for the American press during the Korean
                    war. My best friend, Chin Chul Soo who was deputy managing editor of the leading
                    newspaper, Dong-a Ilbo, spoke impeccable English. He could easily have taught in
                    an American university, or in a French one at that because he was also fluent in
                    French. He is now living in the U.S. although, as was true of many of the
                    leading intellectuals in South Korea are, he was born in North Korea. He taught
                    me a great deal about the inner workings of the Korean press. It was very
                    compromised by heavy political influence. Dong-a Ilbo, however, was quite
                    independent, unlike most of the others that were owned by individuals with
                    strong political ambitions and corporate backgrounds. The Korean national
                    television network, KBS, was a very strong element in the county's communication
                    system.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>There was a Korean news service, Yonhap, which distributed its local feed to
                    subscribers by telex or in some case by messengers. There was a great deal of
                    interest in the press, not just in Seoul but around the country, in not just
                    receiving press releases but actively participating in USIA sponsored seminars
                    on press matters and on American subjects. They wanted to learn more about press
                    freedom, as well as about how the American press did its job. They were vitally
                    interested in anything having to do with American attitudes towards Korea. I
                    think one of the things that made us most useful to them was when Tillman
                    Durdin, an Asian expert and long-time correspondent for the New York Times, went
                    to North Korea, the first American journalist there probably since before the
                    war with the exception of any correspondents that followed the US army across
                    the border. He had interviews all over North Korea and he wrote a very
                    informative series of articles for the Times.</p>
                <p>The Korean Editors' Association was to meet on the island of Chejudo, just off
                    the south-western coast of Korea. It was a lovely island dominated by an
                    inactive, snow-covered volcano. I was invited to attend, and we asked the Voice
                    of America to do an interview with Durdin, in cooperation with our television
                    service in Washington, and we supplied questions that we knew the Korean editors
                    wanted answers to, remembering that the situation in North Korea was as little
                    known to us or them as were conditions in China or other closed societies. VOA
                    did an interview with Durdin, about 20 minutes worth, and I took the videotape
                    to the island with me along with the equipment needed to view it. The editors
                    gave it their rapt attention, and then asked that it be played over and over so
                    that they could fully digest the interview, of which we had both English and
                    Korean versions. All told, as a large group or in smaller groups, they looked at
                    it five times. There was nothing more important to Koreans in those days than
                    issues of security. North Korea's artillery was only 28 miles from Seoul, well
                    within range of the city. More than a million Koreans had died during the war,
                    and our presence was vital to their defense. As one very liberal editor of a
                    leading literary journal told me, there were no doves in Korea, at least at that
                    time. There was no misunderstanding of who started the war or why, and no
                    confusion about what would have happened if the United States had not
                    intervened. They had no desire to lower their guard in any way. That is not the
                    case today.</p>

                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: That's right. Little understanding seems to remain in the younger
                    generation of the history of the conflict or how it started. Among other thing
                    we did at the time was to publish a magazine which included stories on Korean-US
                    interaction and which circulated among many Korean students. Along with a young
                    officer who oversaw the magazine, I had an assistant information officer who was
                    very skilled in communications technology, and he took to video tape very early
                    in the game. I think the post in Korea was the first USIS post that actively
                    used video tape in our information program. I remember one time when Secretary
                    of State Rogers came through. We experimented with the use of tape to ensure
                    that his press conference was accurately reported. Many of the Korean reporters
                    prided themselves on their knowledge of English, but it was a mixed bag. Some of
                    the press people in attendance could make mistakes in a press conference of such
                    importance that they could have serious consequences. So we informed them before
                    the press conference began that we would be recording it on video tapboth the
                    questions and the answers. Since the event was taking place in the mid afternoon
                    and none of the reporters were facing tight deadlines, we asked them to remain
                    in the room after Secretary Rogers left and we would replay the tape, stopping
                    it after each question and answer to translate to ensure that everyone had a
                    full understanding of the Secretary's words. If there were any clarification
                    necessary we would still have Secretary Rogers' spokesman, Charles Bralater
                    deputy director of USIA — in the room to help to handle it. The result was that
                    neither the print nor electronic press was guilty of any distortion of the
                    Secretary's remarks, perhaps a first in our experience with the Korean press,
                    which ranged from the serious and professional to the off the wall amateurs, not
                    unlike our own press. The technique proved to be a useful tool, one that we used
                    when we felt it necessary.</p>
                <p>We also started to refine our methods of getting our material out to the large
                    number of daily newspapers in Seoul and beyond; I think at the time there must
                    have been at least six Korean language newspapers in Seoul and two that
                    published in English, in addition to many radio stations and as I remember three
                    television stations. Although we still made sure that important material got
                    directly to the key reporters and editorial writers and columnists, we started
                    to distribute a good deal of our daily traffic through the Yonhap news service,
                    which circulated to all papers in the country. Since it was coming to papers
                    through their own news service, the press started using some of our materials
                    that otherwise would have been discarded or not even read.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>We also spent a great deal of time with American newsmen. There was no resident
                    American correspondent in Korea at the time, but Don Oberdorfer of the
                    Washington Post, and Bernie Krisher of Newsweek, Herman Nickel of Time Magazine
                    and others were based in Japan and would periodically visit Korea. Phil Habib
                    was a very savvy and colorful ambassador who insisted that he get to meet with
                    the US press guys before they saw anyone in the Korean government, and to see
                    them again before they left the country so that he could pick their brains for
                    any information he might not have picked up on his own.. To digress for a
                    moment, I realize that I hadn't mentioned the ambassadors I worked for in my
                    earlier assignments. When I arrived in Brussels, the ambassador was Ridgeway
                    Knight, a legendary Francophile. Knight was replaced by the first political
                    ambassador I worked for, who was John Eisenhower. He was the son of President
                    Eisenhower, and was quite popular in Belgium because of the association with his
                    father, who was still revered in Europe. He turned out not to be deeply
                    interested in the job, but was a military historian and he hoped to have a good
                    deal of time to pursue his writing and research. He was a bit irked by some of
                    the responsibilities of the office. In the case of the Congo it was a very
                    active and colorful diplomat named G. McMurtrie Godley, who loved to travel
                    wherever there was fighting going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A story I heard, maybe apocryphal, Eisenhower turned to
                        his DCM and was heard to say, “There really isn't much to being an
                        ambassador.” Of course the answer was, “Well you aren't doing very
                        much.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well I choose not to criticize him. You know, I think he did the best
                    he could. He brought a name that really meant something to the Belgians, and to
                    that extent it was a wise appointment. In Korea however my ambassador was Phil
                    Habib.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh boy!</hi>

                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: We had a Brooklyn mafia at the time. Mort Smith was the PAO. He was a
                    very hard driving officer who spent his career in Asia. He was a junior officer
                    in Seoul and then a branch PAO in Kwangju. Then he went away and learned Burmese
                    and spent a long time in Burma. Then he came back to Korea, first as deputy PAO
                    and then as PAO, and later served as press spokesman for Habib when he was
                    Assistant Secretary for East Asia, as DCM in Singapore, and as a Deputy Director
                    for the VOA.. He was from Brooklyn. Phil Habib was from Brooklyn. His secretary
                    was from Brooklyn. The AID director was from Brooklyn. So everybody talked about
                    the Brooklyn Mafia. Habib and I actually grew up in nearby neighborhoods. Habib
                    was from a Lebanese Catholic family, but grew up in New Utrecht, which, like my
                    own neighborhood of Bensonhurst was heavily Jewish and Italian. He told me that
                    he was hired by his religious Jewish neighbors to turn on their lights for the
                    Sabbath on Saturdays. He probably knew as much Yiddish or more than I did. We
                    got on very well. He was very tough, or at least he had mastered the art of
                    acting at being very tough. He was a wonderful person, who, along with his
                    Ambassadorial limousine, kept a nondescript Toyota to drive around in without
                    attracting attention. Later he bought a sports car that I think he drove only on
                    the compound. He found out that we had a poker game going, a Korean-American
                    poker game. There was Mort Smith and myself and Dick Peters the political
                    counselor and four Korean editors, Chin Chul Soo and his boss Park Kwan Sang,
                    both from the Dong-a Ilbo. (Park later became head of the Korean Broadcasting
                    System.) There was also an editor from the Chungang Ilbo and the editor of the
                    official government paper, Seoul Shinmun, the only one that was printed only in
                    Hangul, the Korean alphabet. The other newspapers used a combination of the
                    Hangul and Chinese characters.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>We would play every two weeks, meeting in one another's house, first dinner and
                    then poker. The best food was served in the Korean houses. One of the wives was
                    a professor of home economics at Ewha University which I believe was the oldest
                    women's university in Asia. She was a spectacular cook. We sat on the floor, ate
                    and then played cards. Habib heard about it and said, “I'm playing.” “We already
                    have seven guys,” we pointed out. “OK,” he said. “ Now we have eight, and the
                    next game is at my house.” So we all went over there, and he loved it as did the
                    Korean participants, who had known him when he was a young political officer.
                    But as a result of his being the eighth player we had to play only five-card
                    games, and we developed a game of five card high-low stud in which you dealt
                    cards and then you would turn the first four up one at a time, betting after
                    each turn. The last one remained down. He was a great bluffer, but he was not as
                    successful as legend would have it at the poker table. I don't know how, but I
                    could usually tell when he was bluffing. His tenure in Korea was interrupted
                    when he experienced a very bad angina attack. A young cardiologist at the US
                    Army hospital really saved his life. He said, “Look, you are going to have a
                    massive heart attack. If you have it here we won't be able to save you, but if
                    we can stabilize you and get you back to Walter Reed so you can have it there,
                    you might make it.” That is exactly what happened. He was sent to Walter Reed
                    and returned about three months later, 30 pounds lighter and determined to
                    exercise. Under doctor's orders he took up golf which, before he took it up, he
                    used to chide us about as a waste of time. There was an army golf course in
                    Seoul and he soon became an avid golfer. When he went home and I later followed,
                    we continued a foursome playing around different courses in Virginia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it working in Korea at that time? I mean Park
                        Chung Hee was at the height of his powers and as you said he was a dictator,
                        but he was also popular., I mean the farmers were doing well. The economy
                        was beginning to come along at this time. It hadn't reached its peak but how
                        did you find dealing in such a controlled society?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well we were not restricted as such, but the people we were dealing
                    with had to be careful, and we had to be careful not to get them in trouble.
                    Some of my friends were arrested by the Korean CIA, which was a very rough
                    outfit. They couldn't talk about it afterwards. We began to find out what was
                    happening to them, that for printing unacceptable stories they would be held for
                    several days and be subjected to beatings of the soles of their feet with rubber
                    truncheons. That way the bruises wouldn't show.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this discourage newsmen?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes. Chin Chul Soo eventually left the newspaper business and started
                    teaching because he thought he couldn't follow the government's line. He had
                    been the leader of the press corps that was taken to North Korea during the
                    first meeting between the Korean Red Cross and the North Koreans to arrange
                    family meetings. He was an esteemed newspaperman, and yet even he was treated
                    roughly. When we had heard of a friend disappearing for a few days to a
                    notorious Korean CIA house known as Dong Bingo Dong, we would get together for
                    lunch with him after a respectable wait to let the dust settle. We met always as
                    a small group. When some of them were taken we could let it be known how
                    displeased we were, and Habib communicated firmly that press repression was a
                    strong irritant in our relationship.</p>
                <p>During one of the worst periods in the relationship with the Park Chung Hee
                    regime, the July 4 holiday came around, and one of the two English language
                    papers invited the ambassador to write a column for our Independence Day. He
                    asked me to draft something, and I tried to draft it so that it wasn't
                    inflammatory. But in describing American democracy it made the point that at the
                    heart of our system was the belief that the government must govern with the
                    consent of those it governs. I sent it to him and he asked me to come to his
                    residence. He said, “Where did you get this from. Where did you pick this up
                    from? Is this some Agency material?” I said, “No, I wrote it.” His daughters
                    were upset with him because, they said, “how can you sign your name to something
                    that someone else writes?” He turned to me, not to them and said, “Listen. I did
                    the writing for a hundred people before I ever signed my name to anything, so I
                    will sign it. It's a good piece.” To my surprise it was printed without change
                    in the Korea Herald. The paper was run by Kim Soo Duk, also known as Sugar Kim,
                    and I was afraid that publishing it would get him in trouble. Apparently it
                    didn't because I met him years later at an aviation meeting in Montreal on the
                    downing of the KAL plane by the Soviets. He, like me, was spokesman for his
                    delegation.</p>

                        or pass the word that so and so had been arrested?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: That would go through Habib. He was personally interested. He knew the
                    Korean press guys personally and in many cases for years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about contact with the military, the Korean
                        military?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: We had some, but the US Eighth Army people were the prime contacts
                    with the Korean Army. We did some filming for a newsreel we produced on the
                    Army's training to build confidence in the Korean population about their
                    military capabilities. Once I flew up with a camera crew to film the first night
                    test firing of the Honest John missiles we had given them, not far from the
                    North Korean border on the Imjin River. It was the coldest night I've ever
                    experienced, even including Canada, but the sky was clear and I think the entire
                    Milky Way was in view.</p>
                <p>We got to learn more about the Korea military when I hired a press assistant who
                    had been the head of the defense press corps. His name was Park Seung Taek. Now
                    each of these ministerial press corps was kind of a club, and at the right time
                    of year an envelope would be passed to the head of the group and he would
                    subdivide it among the others. I never thought he would accept my offer, but to
                    my surprise he accepted, because he was tired of being a kept man receiving
                    surreptitious handouts. He became an incredible source of guidance for all of
                    us, both at USIA and at the Embassy. My previous press assistant was a wonderful
                    man, but he decided after having worked for 15 years for us to take advantage of
                    the preferential treatment he had earned to move his family to the U.S. The last
                    I saw of him was in West Allis, Wisconsin where he worked for a bank. But Mr.
                    Park introduced us to military information people who helped us in many ways,
                    and I think was of very good use to the Pol-military officer in the embassy by
                    just letting him know who was who in the military. I mean this was a dense
                    population and culture to penetrate. It is like Japan; it is really an extended
                    family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, I mean, while you were there were any of the
                        famous incidents happening, the Pueblo or the raid on the blue house.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: No, not those events. During my years there were occasional skirmishes
                    along the DMZ that created periods of tension, but the most memorable event by
                    far was Nixon's trip to China. Just the announcement of his visit was stupefying
                    to the Koreans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it have the same effect as the Shokku in Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: It was, oh yes. It was a shock. And although the event was being
                    broadcast on Korean television and our media and government information contacts
                    could see it in their own offices, a large group accepted our invitation to come
                    to our offices to watch it with us. Despite the fact they knew it was happening,
                    and they understood why it was happening, they debated whether it should happen
                    or not. When they saw Nixon step off that plane and shake hands with Chou en Lai
                    there was a collective gasp in the room. They still could not believe what they
                    were seeing, because we had been telling them for all these years that the
                    Chinese represented a threat to their security. After all, they had come into
                    Korea and we and the South Koreans and many other nations had to fight them on
                    Korean soil. The relationship that counts most in Korean families is that of the
                    older brother to the younger brother. They felt they were the younger brothers
                    to us, and I don't know if the right word is betrayal, but it was a reversal of
                    a dogma which they had come to accept as the basis of a mutual approach to world
                    affairs. This was very hard to digest. Probably the government accepted it more
                    easily. I think there was a lot of consultation. They had their own long term
                    interest in China. Korea is a Sinitic culture. China still represents the mother
                    culture, and even though they had their own and they fought to remain
                    independent all these centuries, China was still the 600 pound gorilla in the
                    neighborhood. I think it was in the minds of some long range thinkers in Korea
                    that there would come a time that Korea would benefit from the kind of
                    relationship with China that has now developed. There are huge Korean
                    investments in China now, and Korean style is greatly popular in China,
                    particularly among young people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You only stayed in Korea two years. Was that the normal
                        tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: No, I was supposed to stay for another two years, but my wife was
                    unhappy with the high school. My son had taken up with some boys who were
                    looking for trouble and finding it, and with a daughter approaching high school
                    age as well we asked for and got permission to return to the US.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did you keep touch with Habib?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: As I noted, we played golf in Washington, but not poker. He was a very
                    busy man, particularly after he became Undersecretary of State. Eventually, he
                    developed renewed heart problems and had to retire, but he avoided the heart
                    ailments that had killed his father and brothers in their early 50's and he
                    lived until 71. He enjoyed a happy retirement in California, giving occasional
                    speeches and playing golf. He was truly an extraordinary ambassador, who had a
                    great way with the press. He convinced them that he was giving them inside
                    information because of his ability to give them the impression that he was
                    giving them sensitive confidences. But he was really reading from the hymnal,
                    giving them word for word answers straight from Washington guidance cables. At
                    the same time, he never misled the press, and never betrayed a trust. The last
                    time I saw him alive I was working as PAO in Brasilia, and he had just been
                    named to the job of coordinating our negotiations with the Sandinistas and our
                    relations with the other Central American countries, about which he knew little
                    or nothing. Harry Shlaudeman was our ambassador in Brazil and not only the
                    senior US diplomat in Latin American affairs, but also a former coordinator for
                    Central American policy. Knowing of my past work with Habib he asked me to come
                    along to the airport where Habib was arriving in a military jet. As we walked
                    out to the plane Habib's gaze fixed on me rather than on Shlaudeman and he
                    bellowed, pointing at me, “What are YOU doing here?” Nothing had changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I think this is probably a good place to stop, Stan.
                        We should pick this up the next time in 1973 and where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I went to Washington for five years, then to Mexico, Canada and
                    Brazil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok we will get all these but we will take our time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is 9 August 2004. Stan, you went to Washington. Where did you start or what
                    were you doing in Washington?</p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well, they put me in the East Asian bureau coming out of Korea, and
                    made me the Japan and Korean desk officer, monitoring and assisting the USIS
                    posts there. I was, of course, very familiar with the Korean program. We had a
                    very interesting program underway in Japan which gave rise to a good deal of
                    controversy within the agency. A very creative officer, Alan Carter, was the
                    PAO, and he was developing a very experimental program that was upsetting some
                    of the old timers in the Agency, in part because Alan was getting the attention
                    of younger officers in other posts who wanted to put some of his innovations
                    into their own programs. Alan had been the director of our public affairs
                    program in Vietnam as the war drew down, and had held other senior positions. He
                    had run the motion picture and television division for awhile. Later on, he was
                    the deputy director of a division that went under various names but was
                    essentially the central programming division of USIA.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Alan was trying to institute a program in Japan that took account of its very
                    advanced appreciation of design, its outstanding educational system, and its
                    deep interest in and concern over the impact of US policy on its own security
                    and its economy. His approach corresponded more directly with the kind of
                    analysis that a private public relations firm might make in dealing with the
                    affairs of a client. The audience was more thoroughly analyzed than in most
                    programs to identify the key people whom the post wanted to reach. Every program
                    that was developed was carefully thought out, and had a beginning, a middle and
                    an end. It ended with an evaluation by officers who did nothing but evaluate the
                    work that was done and made an effort to candidly assess its strengths and
                    weaknesses. He had certain theories, one of which was that we did our best work
                    when the programming, whether they were conferences or video or film showings or
                    lectures, took place in our own facilities. Japan, certainly Tokyo was a
                    difficult place to get out to the institutions we dealt witmedia, educational,
                    governmental, artbecause of the size of the city, the traffic and the dispersion
                    of those institutions. And he felt that once we brought them into one of our
                    centers, (and we had centers in six cities, Sapporo in the north, Tokyo, Nagoya,
                    Kyoto, Osaka, Fukuoka, and a VOA transmitter on Okinawa) we could create an
                    American experience.</p>
                <p>He also seemed to some observers to have rules that were extremely rigid and
                    unrealistic. I remember one instance in which they were having a major
                    conference on US Japanese relations and needed a high ranking official
                    participant from Congress or the Executive Branch. I went to the director of the
                    agency, James Keogh, who was able to get the then minority leader of the U.S.
                    Senate, Hugh Scott, who was very knowledgeable on Asian issues, to agree to do
                    an interview with the Japanese audience from a studio at the Voice of America.
                    The problem was that Scott, given his schedule, could agree to participate in
                    principle but had to withhold firm confirmation until we got closer to the date
                    in question, because he had no notion of what the Senate's calendar would be on
                    that date. Because all of our programs involving important people always ran the
                    risk of falling through and disappointing our audiences, Alan had set a deadline
                    for all speakers to absolutely confirm their participation no later than three
                    weeks ahead of the event so that the post could do all the preparatory work,
                    print the biographies and all of the displays that were necessary to create this
                    total experience that he had in mind. He called me up at dinner time in
                    Washington, to say, “We are going to have to pull the plug on Senator Scott,
                    because the three weeks are up.” I said, “Alan, you can't do that. He is not
                    only a leader of the U.S. Senate; he was personally recruited to do this program
                    by the director of the Agency. We just have to wait and keep our fingers crossed
                    and try to have a backup set up in case it falls through.” Well we went to the
                    mat on it and Alan understood that it wasn't going to help his program any if I
                    had to tell the director of the Agency that we're pulling the plug on the
                    Minority Leader of the Senate. Ultimately Senator Scott did appear and made an
                    outstanding presentation.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>Sometime after that an inspection of the post was carried out, led by a notorious
                    opponent of the Japan program, that returned scurrilous findings. One of the
                    inspectors noticed that a picture of President Ford was pasted on a square
                    block, a design feature, and he took it to mean that the post was conveying the
                    message that the president was a blockhead. The inspection report was full of
                    silly observations like that which made it plain that the inspection had been
                    set up to do Alan Carter in, to do the program in. I had mixed feelings about
                    some aspects of the program, but it certainly did not deserve that kind of
                    treatment. It was achieving a lot in an environment that was far more culturally
                    complicated than was true of most of our posts. Alan came to Washington and
                    participated in the kind of face to face showdown that was reminiscent of what
                    Erasmus must have faced in challenging 16th century Catholicism, because the
                    dispute was both theological and political. Alan survived, but the real effort
                    of his opponents was not to destroy the program in Japan but to make sure that
                    nobody else tried to copy it. Well, this was a new experience for me. I had
                    never truly worked in Washington before except for a brief period a few months
                    before I went to language training and then to Africa. The other year I was in
                    Washington was spent at Johns Hopkins. It gave me a totally different picture of
                    the kind of problems that you are not aware of in the field, particularly of the
                    bureaucratic infighting. It was a useful exposure for me once I had major
                    overseas assignments of my own, and prepared me for handling relations with
                    Washington from abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you I mean it really sounds like you are up
                        against a religious experience on one side or the other. People were
                        Carterized or weren't Carterized. Did you get any feel for this? Why were
                        people so adamant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Some of it I guess was politically tinged, but I think more of it came
                    from the old way of doing business in the Agency, in which a public affairs
                    officer turned over his card file to his successor with the names of his
                    contacts. Well, we had gone through several iterations of trying to keep really
                    coherent records of people we had contacted, when they had been contacted, what
                    programs they had participated in, what we knew of them, followed their careers.
                    But Alan developed this to what some felt was extremes, almost a secular
                    catechism. I couldn't second guess that. I had visited Japan when I was in
                    Korea, but when I was assigned to back up the program in Washington I spent a
                    month visiting all of the posts and getting a feel for their program. I started
                    in Sapporo on the northern island of Hokkaido and ended up in Okinawa.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>When I got back to Tokyo Alan was waiting for me with fire in his eyes because he
                    had been getting reports back from each of the branch posts of questions that I
                    was asking that gave him the impression that I was being critical. We had a real
                    set-to, but I observed to him that his branch posts were manned by very young
                    and inexperienced officers, some on their very first assignments after their
                    training assignments, who had nothing to compare the Japan program with. They
                    were obedient practitioners and followers of his system, but had little sense of
                    the need to sometimes color outside of the lines. I showed him the schedule that
                    awaited me at my hotel in Sapporo, where I arrived on a Thursday. Nothing was
                    scheduled that day, Friday was a local holiday, and my schedule showed several
                    appointments on Monday and Tuesday. I called the young man, who was single, at
                    home and invited him to dinner that night. We had a nice talk. I said, “Maybe
                    there are some people who I would like to meet despite the holiday or on the
                    weekend. The schedule was so loose I was wasting a tremendous amount of time. I
                    finally gently conveyed to him the understanding that I wasn't there as a
                    tourist. So we did get some things going, and I did meet some people and learned
                    something about the program. By the time we got finished talking Alan was able
                    to concede that perhaps there was not enough awareness at the post of how
                    beneficial it would be to the whole program if I understood and could represent
                    the posts' program in Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feeling that had been conveyed to you,
                        here is a guy from Washington and he is trying to screw us or upset or do it
                        in, so let's not open up too much. Were they were suspicious of you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: No question there was suspicion, not on Alan's part, but I think these
                    people had been visited by many people interested in what they were doing, and
                    the program had been the object of concern by some of them. Alan knew what was
                    going on in Washington; that the old guard felt that he was trying to be
                    scientific about something that was ultimately intuitive. Well, I didn't come to
                    be a convert to the church of Alan Carter because I didn't think it was
                    applicable to all situations. But I believed that it was extremely important
                    that he try to see if that system would work in a place where we hadn't done a
                    very good job before. Japan had media circumstances that were unbelievably more
                    complicated than most of what any PAO confronted anywhere in the world, and the
                    major media were remarkably advanced. I mean when you had giant publications
                    like Asahi and Yomiuri or TV networks like NHK, these were gigantic media
                    empires. They covered the country by helicopter. The educational institutions
                    and research centers were world class, and Japanese artists had a profound
                    influence on international design standards. He deserved a chance to see if his
                    system worked in such an advanced environment. I think he ultimately did get
                    that chance. But when his tour was up they replaced him with someone with strict
                    orders to resort to more traditional methods of reaching people. I am not sure
                    that worked better. I doubt it. On the other hand, I think Alan was not well
                    served by having people at the posts who were so inexperienced that they were in
                    no position to question whether all things in the program were effective or not.
                    But nonetheless I admired him. He was one of the few people in the Agency who
                    really had the guts to experiment with new techniques. I think they did
                    wonderful things with their Cultural Centers. They redesigned them so that they
                    were up to speed with Japanese design, which was extremely experimental, full of
                    wonderful new ideas which have affected our own sense of design in the US. So I
                    thought it was narrowness on the part of the Agency to be so skeptical and
                    demeaning of something it should have been proud of. Well I only stayed in that
                    job for a year, but it was a very good experience for me. I got a chance to
                    visit Seoul as well and was able to keep in touch with the program and with the
                    friends I had made there, Korean and American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Where did you go when you left the Japan/Korea desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I think we talked about the impact that television had made on me in
                    Brussels, having come from a print world. I had met a Hungarian film maker one
                    of whose films I had sent to Washington without anybody ever looking at it. He
                    was making films about Nobel Prize winners and up, and I thought those were
                    precisely the kind of films that would be meaningful to our audiencefilms on the
                    most distinguished of Americans. Personnel called me and asked if I would go
                    over to the film and television division as the policy officer, the number three
                    position behind the director and the deputy director. I met with the director of
                    television at the time, a political appointee, Bob Scott, a very decent man who
                    had less than a realistic fix on how films and television productions fit into
                    our mission overseas. He had realized that his division was looked down on by
                    the rest of the agency, particularly the Foreign Service, because it seemed that
                    film makers were making films for each other without any relevance to the
                    program in the field, without any full understanding of our audiences. They kept
                    score by the placement of their work in places where people had nothing else to
                    see, Papua New Guinea or wherever. They weren't enabling the posts overseas to
                    reach sophisticated audiences which, as you know, exist even in the least
                    developed countries. The people who ultimately run those countries have a much
                    more sophisticated understanding of the outside world than the people they
                    govern. It seemed that he had sought to balance that by getting a deputy
                    director who was a Foreign Service officer. But as so often happens, personnel
                    sent to him someone who couldn't be placed anywhere else. He had gotten someone
                    who was far short of what was needed. So he wanted to fill in behind him with
                    the number three man.</p>
                <p>I didn't fully realize that at first, and I told Bob Scott over lunch that I
                    would not take the job if it meant simply clearing their stuff with the State
                    Department to make sure that it didn't violate any policy or to monitor it
                    myself for that reason. I was concerned about the quality; I was concerned about
                    the product. I told him the story of the film I had sent to the film division
                    that no one had even deigned to look at to see what someone in the field thought
                    should be the kind of material we needed. He said, “Well, I promise you that we
                    will look at it and if I think it is workable, we will let you oversee the
                    making of a pilot of that kind.” So I took the job. I moved down there, to a
                    building in, at the time, a rather neglected area of Washington on 7th and D
                    Streets, now a very lively neighborhood. It was a very different world because
                    it was dominated by Civil Service rather than Foreign Service people. I was not
                    aware of the intensity of competition and jealousy within the ranks of the Civil
                    Service, in which you could not advance unless someone else was knocked out of
                    the way. This was not true of the Foreign Service, because we were constantly
                    changing jobs, moving to and from Washington and between geographic areas. You
                    could be promoted by virtue of your performance and not necessarily because a
                    job of that rank is waiting for you.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>When I got down there, I retrieved the film on Rene Dubose, a French-born
                    scientist working at the Rockefeller Institute, who was the first to connect
                    environmental degradation with human health. I showed it to Bob and several
                    others that he had called in to look at it. Everybody immediately said, “Oh it's
                    not up to our standards of production quality.” I said, “Of course not.” It was
                    black and white; it was grainy. That was not the point. The point was the
                    content and the subject and the approach and the ideas. Bob said he saw what I
                    meant and would let me oversee the production of a pilot to see if it worked. He
                    then asked me, not in front of all these people but privately who I wanted to
                    start with, and I said Margaret Mead. He took that to the front office. James
                    Keogh was the director, and they came back with a suggestion that we start with
                    Clare Booth Luce. I said that I didn't think she had the worldwide reputation
                    that Margaret Mead had. We were looking for people whose greatness we did not
                    have to explain or justify, but a subject that our audiences would want to
                    listen to; who would want to see this film because of what they knew about the
                    contributions of this person. The front office backed off and we started
                    working.</p>
                <p>Now I had no way to be sure that Margaret Mead would agree to make the film. She
                    was not a favorite of the administration, nor was she a supporter. That was the
                    first task. Next, I had to get someone in the film making staff, an executive
                    producer, to work with me on the technical side. The production director who had
                    been brought in politically was a very colorful guy from California whose beard
                    was about four times larger than yours. But he had great sympathy for what I was
                    trying to do. He gave me a young fellow just out of the Air Force who had not
                    been contaminated by the old executive producers there, people who didn't
                    produce films but who chose the producers and oversaw their work. They were the
                    project directors, not immediate hands on people. The person they brought me was
                    Tim White, a very capable young man. He was a conservative and I wasn't but we
                    got along very well. He understood what I was going to do. We were going to try
                    to do something which had a high level of credibility, which meant we didn't
                    want the film maker's art to be so obvious that sophisticated audiences would
                    feel they were being manipulated. We wanted Mead to narrate her life story and
                    to talk about the contributions she had made, and to use those filmic elements
                    needed to make the film attractive to the eye and to the ear, but to really make
                    sure that the individual was the story, that her ideas would come through so
                    that the audience felt they had spent an intimate hour with that person.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>I called up Margaret Mead to explain our plan, and she said that she would be in
                    Washington and would meet us for breakfast at the Mayflower Hotel. Tim and I
                    talked about it first. We were going to have to tell her that this is a
                    government film and that the interviews would take place over a much longer time
                    than an hour, so we would have to edit her remarks. If at some point there was
                    something that could be an embarrassment to the government, we would probably
                    have to cut that out. And if she couldn't live with that, then there was no way
                    we could run the risk of making a film that she would then denounce. So we sat
                    down with her. Before we could get a word out of our mouths she said, “USIA is a
                    great agency. You stood up to Joe McCarthy. I would like to make this film but I
                    don't want to get you guys in trouble. So if I say anything that could be
                    embarrassing don't worry, just stop the camera and we will start over.” She was
                    absolutely delightful. We didn't know that she knew at the time she had a
                    terminal illness. She died three years later. The film was very basic. We made
                    it very cheaply. We had about $30,000 over and above what I now know is a large
                    part of the below line costs, such as the salaries of the people that are doing
                    things and the administrative overhead. All that was there, the money was there.
                    The government process spoiled me for my later film-making efforts; once we got
                    the subject to say yes, the money was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get access of footage of her...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: We were able to get from WETA portions of a film that she had made on
                    her return to Papua New Guinea, and of her speaking in pidgin English with the
                    natives there. So yes we did. We also shot in various locations. We shot a good
                    deal of the interviews in the tower of the Museum of Natural History in New
                    York, which was the temporary office she had been given when she first got
                    there. But as she said in the film, “I soon found out that this was a wonderful
                    office. There were two staircases, and if someone was coming up that you didn't
                    want to see on one staircase, you could go down the other.” She was wonderful.
                    The film was finished and we showed it to people in the division and they said
                    “Very good and interesting but you know, we don't know how the posts are going
                    to react, how they are going to use it.” I said, “Well why don't I take it and
                    show it before we distribute it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The system was that normally we would ask posts if they wanted it and you would
                    send it to the posts who would order it. So I set off on a trip for one month. I
                    started in Tokyo and ended in Istanbul with 12 stops in between. It was the most
                    demanding trip I've ever made in my life. I would get to a place in the evening,
                    work the next day, see people that night and leave the following morning. I went
                    from Tokyo to Seoul to Taipei, to Manila to Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok to New Delhi
                    to Tehran to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem to Cairo to Ankara and Istanbul. Everywhere
                    I went we would show it to a television station; we would show it to a woman's
                    group and maybe some other viewers that the post thought appropriate. Absolutely
                    without exception, every television station production chief we showed it to
                    said: “Why aren't we making a film like this with”.... and then they would name
                    their “living national treasure.” It struck a spark. The posts liked it, and we
                    sent it out. It was shown quite widely. As a matter of fact quite recently the
                    centenary of Margaret Mead's birth was celebrated at the Smithsonian. Wilton
                    Dillon, senior scholar at the Smithsonian, was a student of Mead's, and is a
                    member of the board of directors of the non-profit corporation I formed when I
                    retired to continue doing this kind of thing. He asked me to cut the film to a
                    half an hour so it could be shown at that conference, and I did that. So it is
                    still alive and in the National Archives, although there is some doubt as to the
                    survival of all of the footage that didn't make it into the film. I still have
                    to investigate that. I was told it was thrown out, but I don't believe it. We
                    went on to make six films in this series, which was called “Reflections.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: After Mead we did Samuel Eliot Morrison, the historian; architect
                    Buckminster Fuller; AFL-CIO head George Meany, and NAACP executive director Roy
                    Wilkins. By this time I was really getting leaned on to choose people who I
                    thought had so obvious a political message that they would be very suspect, and
                    would undermine the credibility that the series had gained. We proposed that the
                    posts themselves could let us know who they wanted to show to their audiences.
                    We sent out a list but let them add names that they came up with. The name that
                    was not on the list but that everybody put at the top was Leonard Bernstein. He
                    was younger than our typical participant. We wanted people who were at the age,
                    as we delicately put it, at which it was appropriate to start summing up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The age of reflection.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The age of reflection. But we also did Bernstein when he was about 60.
                    I wasn't around for the completion of all these films, but I identified the
                    people and got them to agree to participate. I got Bernstein through a friend of
                    mine in Milwaukee, Ben Barkin. He represented Schlitz beer which underwrote the
                    summer season of the New York Philharmonic. When Bernstein came to Brussels with
                    the orchestra, Barkin was on the platform behind him as TV floodlights blinded
                    them. I called out “Who is that guy with Ben Barkin!” He almost fell off the
                    platform. Well Ben got Bernstein to agree to make the film. It is the only film
                    of the six that is not now in the public domain because his estate has got it
                    tied up. Somehow the Agency had to agree to give him the rights to his voice,
                    and gave the visual rights to the producer. Perhaps in time that will also
                    become publicly available because it is a wonderful film. That was made
                    partially in Israel because it was too expensive to film him conducting the New
                    York Philharmonic, but it was much more reasonable to go to Israel to film him
                    conducting the Israel Philharmonic.</p>
                <p>But overseeing “Reflections” was only part of my duties. I worked very closely
                    with our news division in an effort to get them to cover activities that were
                    useful to our posts, and that meant that either we had to figure out how do
                    stories that had lasting meaning, or else get them footage of timely events more
                    quickly than we could by sending it through the pouch. An opportunity arose when
                    President Ford was to deliver his State of the Union Address. It would be
                    written about in the foreign press, but there weren't satellites around at that
                    time to give them access to the event in real time, or to give them the voice
                    and image of the speech and of the House of Representatives. And language was
                    also a problem. So we set up an experiment to see how fast we could get the
                    entire speech on film to key posts in the language of their countries.</p>
                <p>We started by bringing translators into the studio to monitor the speech, with
                    advance texts available, and take notes as they viewed it. We did this, as I
                    remember, in French, German, Arabic, Japanese, Italian and Russian. At the same
                    time, we had people calling around to all of the international agencies of the
                    US governmento State, AID, the Peace Corps, the Foreign Agricultural Servicany
                    Agency that might have people traveling abroad that weekend (the speech, I
                    believe, was on a Friday). We found the people we needed and gave them a copy of
                    the film in a large case to take immediately to the USIS office at the Embassy,
                    or in some cases we'd have someone at the airport to meet them. The result was
                    that on that Sunday night, the PAO in Bonn was able to host a showing at his
                    home for a large roomful of German officials and newsmen, and other posts who
                    received the films in record time thought it was a real breakthrougeven those
                    who received it in English were able to use it for their key English speaking
                    contacts. This was just a foretaste of what communications would be like once
                    satellite transmissions became possible.</p>

                <p>It was also the year of the bicentennial, and we were looking for a project that
                    would be equal to the occasion. There was a plan to make a film about a
                    forthcoming scientific breakthrough that the US was deeply involved in, and they
                    chose to explore the early work in genetic splicing and its implications.
                    Several of us thought this was fine but too narrow, and what we eventually
                    produced was a series of 13 half-hour programs on the cutting edge of American
                    science in, among other fields, physics, aeronautics, space, agriculture,
                    paleontology (that one was called “Exploring the Past), and even social
                    sciences. The films were very widely used and translated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. And where did you go once the assignment in the Film
                        division was over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I had been assigned to attend the Senior Seminar in National and
                    International Affairs beginning in late August of 1977, but in February as I
                    remember I had a call from the Personnel Division asking me if I could recommend
                    anyone who would be able to serve as spokesman for the US delegation to the
                    Sixth Conference on the Law of the Sea at the UN. The delegation was to be
                    headed by Elliot Richardson, one of the most distinguished public servants of
                    his time. A friend of mine, McKinney Russell, had been named Deputy Director of
                    the film division, and he was one of the best officers in the Agency. So I felt,
                    having worked with him for several months to help him get settled in, that it
                    would be a very useful phase between then and the beginning of the seminar to
                    propose myself for the task, as long as Richardson agreed and would allow me to
                    leave in time to attend the seminar.</p>
                <p>Q, Well, you're a New Yorker. What was it like to go home again?</p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The experience in New York was wonderful. I was born and raised in New
                    York but left on my 17th birthday to go to school in Wisconsin. I had visited my
                    parents of course, but only had lived in New York again for three months when I
                    got out of the army and took a temporary job working for Funk and Wagnalls,
                    editing their international yearbook and looking for my first newspaper job. My
                    college room mate, Dick Schickel, had become a movie critic for Time, and found
                    for me this wonderful two story apartment in a four story brownstone house on
                    the upper East Side that I was able to rent for the four months or so that I
                    would be in New York. That gave me the opportunity to rediscover the city and to
                    realize I could live there again. It was a great joy. I went back to Washington
                    as much as I could. My kids came up. My wife came up, but I was relearning the
                    New York City subway system, and I delighted in it.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>Richardson himself was an extraordinary human being, a truly great person who
                    would have made a wonderful President if only it were an appointive position. He
                    often introduced a speech by recalling being introduced by someone who said:
                    “Ladies and gentlemen, I now want to present the former Undersecretary of State,
                    former Assistant Secretary and later Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare,
                    former Secretary of Defense, Former Secretary of Commerce, former Attorney
                    General, and former Ambassador to the Court of St. James. Ladies and gentlemen,
                    I present to you the former Elliot Richardson.” He loved that story and told it
                    over and over again. But he wasn't the former anything. He was a truly great
                    public servant, and an extremely decent and self-effacing man.</p>
                <p>During the summer of 1977, the summer of the great New York blackout, I had a
                    phone call from a reporter for the Boston Globe, his hometown paper. He said
                    that he had just seen a private preview of an interview former President Nixon
                    was doing with David Frost, and added: “Nixon talks about the firing of Spiro
                    Agnew, the resignation of Agnew. He talks about Richardson, when he was Attorney
                    General, coming to him with the evidence on Agnew. Nixon is saying that he told
                    Richardson 'Yes, but you can't get out in front on this and announce it because
                    everybody knows you wanted the vice presidential nomination and will think it is
                    vengeance. So we will have to handle it a different way.' The question is, would
                    Richardson confirm this.” I said, “Well I don't know, but I will talk to him.”
                    It was late; it must have been seven or eight o'clock at night. We all worked
                    late during the UN session and I went into his office and I told him of this
                    conversation. Richardson said, “It is absolutely true.” I said, “Well do you
                    want to talk to him or not?” He said, “Sure, why don't you get him on the
                    phone.” (I reflected on the widely known fact that Richardson harbored
                    presidential ambitions and would want to keep on good terms with the Boston
                    Globe.) So I got him on the phone and stayed in the office as Richardson was
                    answering the questions. I, of course, could only hear his responses, but I
                    could sense what he was being asked. I knew exactly what was happening. He was
                    in a talkative mood, and a very good reporter realized this and was leading him
                    into much different issues than Richardson had agreed to discuss. I wrote him a
                    little note that, on reflection, was somewhat out of line. “You should say only
                    what you want to see in print and then shut up.” He looked at it and he
                    terminated the conversation. He said, “I wish I had met you 20 years ago.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well before we leave this Washington time, you were with
                        the American Foreign Service Association which essentially is the Foreign
                        Service's union. This is a pretty active time for it wasn't it? These were
                        people who were, I mean it was sort of the era of the young Turks.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes it was. Bill Harrop, Charles Bray and Tom Boyatt were among the
                    founders of the movement to take what was a professional association and change
                    its nature to compete to represent its members as a union. This dilemma arose
                    because the Nixon administration surprisingly moved to allow government
                    employees to form active unions. AFSA would have to become a representative for
                    bargaining purposes on issues relevant to Foreign Service members, making it a
                    bona fide employee labor organization. If not, the American Federation of
                    Government Employees or some other existing public employee union would have the
                    inside track to organize Foreign Service officers. And the question was, did the
                    Foreign Service belong in the same bargaining unit with an organization
                    representing a much larger membership of civil servants, whose interests, and
                    problems were so different from those of us who lived and worked under very
                    different conditions and very different personnel rules.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you mentioned before, quite a difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Bill Harrop and I were friends from the Congo. He had been the consul
                    general for the latter part of my stay in Lubumbashi, and had earlier served in
                    Brussels. I saw him when he came through Brussels when he took a year off from
                    the Foreign Service and devoted it to organizing AFSA as a union. By the time I
                    got back to Washington, they had already won the representation election and
                    were actively and aggressively representing Foreign Service interests. Tom
                    Boyatt was president of the AFSA Board of Governors when I served my first term
                    on the board. He's still active in AFSA in retirement. There was a move in the
                    mid 1970's to absorb USIA into the State Department, a move that finally
                    succeeded during the Clinton Administration. Everybody at State thought we
                    really wanted to be part of State and be part of the Mother Church. I had mixed
                    feelings about this. I had been in the Agency for only ten years or so, and
                    could see benefits in terms of career advancement for some officers, but that we
                    would face a loss of independence in carrying out our programs. Knowing what I
                    know now and seeing the results of the amalgamation of the Agency into State, it
                    is very clear that the fears of the old timers were very well founded. Public
                    diplomacy has suffered a great loss of identity and agility by becoming part of
                    a much larger bureaucracy, in which public diplomacy is being confused with
                    domestic public affairs. I am not sure whether public diplomacy suffers by being
                    more closely identified with the State Department overseas as some do, but in
                    any case I don't think that is a major problem. I think the real problem relates
                    to resources.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>There is a natural tendency within State to consider the work of its political
                    and economic officers to be the heart of its diplomatic responsibility. That's
                    where career ambassadors come from, although it's true that a number of public
                    diplomacy officers have gotten ambassadorial posts. And it's hard to dispute
                    that the work of gathering and analyzing information about the politics and
                    economies of the governments with which we deal, and to carry out the diplomatic
                    relationship on issues of highest importance, is the primary reason for the
                    existence of foreign ministries. But it means that, without the independent
                    budget that USIA had, the functions of units of State that don't have the lead
                    role become subservient, and their budgets become vulnerable. The major
                    exceptions to this is Diplomatic Security because of the challenge of dealing
                    with protecting embassies in an age of terrorism, and Administration, because
                    they control the money. That first attempt at consolidation failed, and I'm
                    grateful that I never had to work under the present conditions, in which there
                    are no Deputy Assistant Secretaries for public diplomacy in the regional bureaus
                    as there should be, but only an officer and staff at a functional or regional
                    desk. And although there is an Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy, he or she
                    doesn't have control of the functional budget or of personnel assignments.
                    Serving on the Board was very useful because it broadened my understanding of
                    and exposure to issues that affected people in the Foreign Service outside USIA
                    and State, such as those who work for the Foreign Commercial Service, the
                    Foreign Agriculture Service, AID and others. There were issues involving
                    Consular affairs, administration, and many others matters that I had never been
                    sufficiently concerned about, and it helped to broaden my understanding of the
                    problems of my colleagues. Above all, it helped me a great deal once I went back
                    overseas and had a major post to run. I was made aware that we were not alone in
                    the Embassy or even in USIA. So that was a very useful experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the USIA-State merger issue finally resolved?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: We held meetings at USIA to hammer out what would be the position of
                    the two-person USIA membership on the AFSA Board. We formed a negotiating team
                    within the AFSA board, trying to negotiate a description of a relationship which
                    would give us freedom of operation consistent with what had always existed,
                    meaning political policy guidance from the Secretary of State or his
                    representatives. That was not an issue overseas, since the Kennedy
                    administration established the primacy of the Ambassador over all of the
                    agencies that worked in the embassy. We knew that the PAO and his staff worked
                    for the Ambassador as well as for his area director back home, and that most
                    Ambassadors understood that we lived within budgets that were set for us in
                    Washington. The PAO had two Efficiency Reports written on him or her. We formed
                    an advisory team within USIA to back us up in negotiations, and eventually
                    arrived at a position that tried to square the circle, in which a closer
                    relationship would be formed to negate the possibility of the kind of clash
                    between the Secretary of State and the head of USIA that had occurred when Frank
                    Shakespeare, a conservative Nixon appointee, had made public statements that
                    contradicted the position of then Secretary William Rogers. But our paper had no
                    effect because the White House let the matter drop and apparently was not
                    interested in effecting a merger. I am on the board again by the way, as a
                    retiree representative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we go on to the Senior Seminar, give us some more
                        on your work for Richardson on the Law of the Sea issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Richardson was very interested in the way the newspapers were going to
                    treat this sixth conference on the issue, to know if they would be interested in
                    covering it after all these years of negotiations.. The impression I was getting
                    from our contacts with newsmen was not promising. Their attitude was “call us up
                    when you've got an agreement.” The issues, after all, were very arcane. One of
                    the reasons I took the assignment was that I had overseen production of a film
                    on the issues involved in the Law of the Sea, including navigation rights, the
                    rights of maritime passage, offshore zones of economic control, the mining of
                    manganese nodules found on the sea bottom,. and the status of the sea beyond
                    national territorial zones, that developing nations wanted treated as “the
                    common heritage of mankind”, to be overseen by a new entity that would. exploit
                    the wealth of the sea for all nations to enjoy.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>Richardson had two deputy directors of the staff. His principal aide was Richard
                    Darman, who went on to be a heavyweight in the Reagan administration as budget
                    director and has since made a lot of money at the Carlyle Group. His career was
                    built on working in ever more important jobs for Richardson, as assistant
                    secretary of whatever Richardson was Secretary of, but he felt that Richardson
                    was a very dangerous man, who had, in Darman's view, unduly idealistic views of
                    the world. When I came along and started writing stuff for Richardson he came in
                    to my office and said, “My God. What have we allowed to happen here. The two of
                    you guys think the same.” He didn't think that the open sea should be treated as
                    the common heritage of mankind. In his view that was nonsense. Who gets there
                    first owns it. If you can mine the manganese, you mine it! The nodules were
                    there for the taking, although it took advanced technology to find it and bring
                    it to the surface economically. Manganese is an inappropriate name for it. It
                    was the nickel that was within the nodules that was the most valuable mineral.
                    But in any case, the press was not excited about it and wouldn't be until there
                    was the prospect of an agreement.</p>
                <p>I suggested that it could be useful to go to New York before the session began to
                    meet with several key editorial boards to explain the importance of the issues
                    to them, and he agreed. I set up calls on the editorial boards of the New York
                    Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Daily News. The Daily News was,
                    he thought, an unusual venue since their readers didn't seem to be interested in
                    such matters. But a former colleague of mine at the Milwaukee Journal had become
                    chief of their Washington Bureau, and he told me that the new editor of the News
                    was very interested in international affairs, so he helped set that up. We went
                    to the Daily News first and were received very warmly, despite the fact that it
                    was then seen as a conservative newspaper. Lo and behold the next day there was
                    an editorial in the News supporting the goal of the conference, including
                    Richardson's picture. The experts on the staff were impressed because it had
                    been a long time since the issue had gotten that kind of attention. We went next
                    to meet with the editorial board of the New York Times, where Max Frankel, who
                    wrote those limericks in Limerick that so outraged the Nixon staff, was on the
                    editorial board. We had a very useful discussion with them, and found a number
                    of the editorial writers well versed on the issues. Then we went to the Wall
                    Street Journal and we ran into a buzz saw. I have never experienced such vitriol
                    heaped on a man of Richardson's distinction. He reassured me afterwards that he
                    wasn't upset. But Jude Wanniski, who was a very conservative economist, ripped
                    him up one side and down the other about the whole negotiation, about its
                    economic aspect, and about the proposed changes in maritime law. We had the
                    biggest navy in the world and didn't have to worry about anyone else. It was
                    clear that the Wall Street Journal had a schizophrenic problem unlike that of
                    any other newspaper. It is a very serious newspaper, with an editorial board
                    that is close to insane. The contrast between the quality of work of its news
                    staff and its editorial writers is probably greater than any newspaper in the
                    United States and possibly the world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It continues too doesn't it?</hi>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: To this day. We kept trying to bring them around. Admiral Max Morris
                    represented the Navy on the negotiating team. I told him that the Journal's
                    editor was not at the meeting with Richardson and that perhaps he would be
                    impressed by the strategic issues if Morris would brief him privately. Morris
                    had a lot of Navy money to spend so he invited the editor, whose name escapes
                    me, to lunch at Fraunces Tavern in lower Manhattan, an historic place. Morris
                    tried to talk the editor into understanding that there were very real economic
                    and defense interests involved, especially naval interests concerning freedom of
                    passage through straits. He couldn't move him an inch. Obviously he had been
                    briefed on his staff's meeting with Richardson and I had the feeling that
                    Wanniski was the point man for the board on that issue. My agreement with
                    Richardson was that I'd be able to stay only through mid-August, and would have
                    to go back to Washington for my assignment to the Senior Seminar. He gave me a
                    nice dinner and I was chagrined that the draft treaty that came out of the
                    conference was not ratified by the Reagan administration, although several
                    aspects of the treaty have been accepted by us as international law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave the Law of the Sea conference, was Roz
                        Ridgeway on the team at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: No, not at that time. She was later in charge of all fisheries
                    issues..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I think somebody mentioned, you know all this stuff
                        about mining nodules was basically a cover for the CIA operation of the
                        Glomar Explorer which was to raise a Soviet submarine. The nodules were not
                        a possible thing and there was enough nickel elsewhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I am not sure that was the case. At the time the Glomar Explorer was
                    out there trying to raise that submarine, and they could have used the undersea
                    mining thing as a cover. But Richardson certainly took the mining issue
                    seriously. He felt that we had to negotiate the ratification of the treaty at
                    the same time we were negotiating the treaty itself. So he formed a very large
                    group of NGO's with interests in different aspects of the Law of the Sea, tried
                    to bring them along and involve them in every stage of the negotiations, as well
                    as private interests such as those interested in deep sea mining.Q: Not just
                    NGO's but private concerns.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Mining companies were very assiduous participants in those meetings
                    and were represented on the negotiating team. They had samples of those
                    manganese nodules encased in Lucite. I had one on my desk. They made sure to
                    remind me of its importance. Now nothing much has come of it because things have
                    changed; there is lots of nickel in Canada, Indonesia and Cuba, as well as, I
                    think, in Russia. But at the time it was felt that not only was the resource of
                    potential value, but that the principle of freedom of access was as well. Of
                    course the developing countries were talking about some international control
                    system, and that was anathema to the private sector and to many people in the
                    public sector. But in any case I am not aware of deep undersea mining becoming
                    financially feasible as yet.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It may at some point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: It could be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to senior seminar for what, a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: An academic year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: '77-'78. We were the 20th session. We called ourselves the fighting
                    20th.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was the 17th.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Oh, predecessors of ours. Well as you know it was possibly the
                    greatest year of its kind that anyone could have invented, but now it's been
                    phased out. As Hume Horan, a brilliant member of our class, once remarked,
                    somebody took a look at it and said, “What, a year for these guys to roam around
                    the country and get to know the gay community and the Chinese community and go
                    to Puerto Rico and talk to the factions there, and then traipse around the
                    world? What nonsense! We can do this in three weeks.” Well it is a shame. I
                    think it was the most exciting year I spent in the Foreign Service in terms of
                    really coming to grips with some of the domestic issues that we may have known
                    of intellectually, but were unable to truly grasp the way the country was
                    changing because we were overseas. It didn't hit us. We weren't aware of the
                    impact that rising degrees of crime and violence were having on the cities and
                    on the political behavior of Americans. During most of the year our focus was
                    largely on energy, because it was the year after the great energy crisis when
                    gasoline went to the unheard of level of 65 cents a gallon and there were lines
                    waiting to fill up. So many of us set off in a different direction and invited a
                    lot of speakers on energy.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>But because it was the 20th year of the seminar, they proposed to the Soviet
                    Foreign Ministry, working through their embassy in Washington, that they invite
                    us to go to the Soviet Union for a few weeks and the Soviet senior diplomatic
                    training group would be invited to come to the United States for an equal length
                    of time. They agreed, and we went but, for whatever reason, they passed on the
                    opportunity to send their senior training group. Before we left on that trip,
                    which was going to be to Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev, we went to a briefing
                    given by the deputy chief of mission of the Soviet Embassy, who was extremely
                    acerbic, who said, “You are going to go and you are going to come back and tell
                    stories that the Russians aren't living as well. You won't understand their
                    culture. You will carry with you the prejudices, all the rest of it.” We also
                    met with the Polish ambassador, who later defected to the US, who was charming
                    and welcomed us warmly. We stopped in Brussels on the way to Moscow for a
                    briefing at NATO, delivered by former Secretary of State Alexander Haig, who had
                    become our Ambassador to NATO. So off we went, and had an extraordinary time
                    traveling for two weeks in the Soviet Union and several days in Warsaw. We were
                    struck by the variety of experiences we encountered in the USSR. We went to the
                    opera in each of the cities we visited, and were delighted by the intimacy of
                    their opera halls. Even the Bolshoi opera house in Moscow was smaller and less
                    overwhelming than most opera houses I've been in.</p>
                <p>One day we were taken on a long ride to what we were told would be a model pig
                    farm. The drive through the countryside was pleasant, and we were taken off the
                    bus and led into a small movie theater and shown a film of the pigs and how they
                    were handled, how well they were treated, and presented a slide show on the
                    production levels and the scientific advances that had been made in the
                    industry. Then we were led back to the bus. We asked “Where are the pigs?” We
                    were told: “They are not available right now,” We never saw a pig, a live pig at
                    that pig farm. We didn't meet the Soviet deputy ambassadorin Washington again,
                    but we all agreed that if we could, that would be the first story we would throw
                    at him.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>Another event that was more rewarding was a couple of hours we spent with a very
                    engaging man who was the head of the Soviet Arctic exploration division in their
                    ministry of science. He was explaining the importance of the north to Russia and
                    of the great effort the nation was making to exploit the riches of the arctic.
                    He also made reference to the Law of the Sea in connection with the Soviet naval
                    program, and then took questions. I asked him why the Soviet Union had failed to
                    agree to provisions of the treaty that would seem to be as important to their
                    economy and security as they were to ours. He said, “Those are questions which
                    affect all delegations, and each delegation has different perspectives on these
                    things for various reasons which we needn't go into.” I felt he was a man we
                    should not press on this because obviously he was a serious scientist and
                    couldn't honestly defend a position that he knew to be a matter for politicians
                    to defend. We became aware of the extent to which political pressures affected
                    every element of Soviet policy. He was a scientist, working in a society that
                    was obviously very controlled, and left little room for dissent. We also were
                    aware, since many of my colleagues had served in Eastern Europe, that Soviets
                    standards of living were remarkably below those of most of their empire,
                    something that was confirmed by what we saw in Warsaw. It may be the only empire
                    in history where this was the case. This was particularly true in East Germany
                    and Poland, and, I am sure, in Czechoslovakia. But we did have some warm
                    contacts with our interlocutors which gave us reason to believe that there were
                    a wide range of political feelings which, for understandable reasons, could not
                    be expressed. At the same time, they were patriotic and proud of whatever they
                    could point to as improvements in their lives.</p>
                <p>In other trips we went to Puerto Rico and had interviews with all of the
                    different factions on the issue of whether the island should remain a
                    commonwealth or become a State or seek independence, and we were able to visit
                    several other parts of that lovely but troubled island. We visited military
                    bases, and went to Greenville, Mississippi at the urging of Hodding Carter III
                    who was the State Department's spokesman, and the son of a legendary newspaper
                    editor who was one of the few voices of reason in the South at that time. His
                    mother was still living there. We went out to a remarkable dinner, to a place
                    called Doe's Eating Place, which I think they tried to expand to other cities
                    when Bill Clinton was president. They had the best meat I have ever tasted in
                    the United States. I wouldn't include Argentina but certainly the United States.
                    We went after that to the only place in town where you could get a late drink,
                    that was in a Chinese restaurant. Hodding Carter's remarkable mother took us
                    there, and showed us a trick I've used whenever I've found myself in a situation
                    where it was necessary to be a good sport and show that I had some talent. She
                    pushed a cork into a wine bottom and challenged us to get it out without
                    breaking the bottle. I won't tell you how to do it but some day I'll show you.
                    Greenville was a remarkable place. It was different from the south that I had
                    seen. It was delta country, and older than Columbus, Georgia or Phenix City,
                    Alabama, which were not settled until 1828. It was cotton farming country, and
                    there were efforts made to support independent, struggling black farmers. We
                    were taken to some African -American sponsored businesses that were being
                    stimulated by the office of economic opportunity, and we came away with some
                    hope that change was possible in the deep South, as has proved to be the
                    case.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>We also went to San Francisco and met with the leaders of gay groups, and the
                    head of the Chinese community, who arranged a great dinner for us. We went to
                    New York and spent a day looking over the shoulder of intake workers in a
                    welfare office in the Bronx. We encountered a range of experiences that would
                    have been difficult to imagine had we not had that year. Among our speakers, I
                    arranged for my former boss, then Governor and now Judge John Reynolds, senior
                    federal court judge in Milwaukee, to come and speak to us about the judicial
                    system and its problems. He was a great foe of mandatory sentencing laws that
                    had been passed by Congress at a time when the American people had been
                    persuaded that judges were soft on criminals. He made a very strong case for
                    letting the judge decide the sentence, because the facts of each case were
                    rarely the same, and trying to make one shoe fit all led to many injustices.</p>
                <p>Each of us was given six weeks to travel to almost any place in the world to
                    gather information and write a paper that could be useful to the group. Hume
                    Horan and I had become close, and we decided we should do a paper jointly in a
                    place we might not otherwise get to during our lifetimes. That would probably be
                    Antarctica. So we designed a joint project that would involve the political and
                    environmental issues of that continent. But it turned out that the time frame in
                    which the research would be done would be in the Antarctic summer, when large
                    planes couldn't land on the ice. The Navy would have to take us from
                    Christchurch, New Zealand, in a lumbering C-130. The flight could take more than
                    eight hours and, if the weather closed in unexpectedly, we'd have to turn back
                    and try again. We decided, regretfully, that the plan was impractical, so Hume
                    did a paper on the administration of the national parks of the US, taking his
                    son along, and I went to Mexico at the urging of Ambassador Patrick Lucey,
                    chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party when I worked for the governor and
                    later governor himself. He said that we were beginning to learn that Mexico
                    could be another Iran and that I should come down there and do my paper on the
                    Mexican oil situation. I did, and got access to a lot of interesting Mexicans
                    with whom I later came to work closely. I wrote a paper which indicated that our
                    fears that the world's oil supply was quickly coming to an end were probably
                    overstated. Sadly, that remarkable year ended, as it had to, but left all of us,
                    I believe, rejuvenated and re-educated about our own country. By the time it
                    ended I knew I was going to Mexico as public affairs counselor, which would be
                    my first post at which I really had responsibility for the entire public affairs
                    program. It was a very large program with, at the time, about 20 Americans and
                    120 Mexicans in three cities, Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey.</p>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well, while I was working at IMV I got a phone call from Governor.
                    Lucey who was in the middle of his second term. He told me that he was going to
                    announce his resignation as governor the next day and would accept appointment
                    as ambassador to Mexico, a post offered to him by newly elected President
                    Carter. He said he wanted me to come down with him. I said, “Pat, we don't do
                    things like that in the Foreign Service. Number one, I am the USIA
                    representative to the American Foreign Service Association board. It's our
                    union. We frown on ambassadors who come in and tried to replace their staff with
                    old buddies. He said, laughing, “You know, I asked you to come back when I was
                    elected governor, so I figured the only way I can get you to work for me again
                    was to join the Foreign Service.” I said, “That's very kind of you, but you
                    should go down there and get to know your staff and work with them. If they are
                    not doing what you want them to do, tell them what you want. If that doesn't
                    work, you are free to make changes, but in doing so, you can talk to the
                    director of the Foreign Service and to personnel. You can try to get the kind
                    people you need, but you shouldn't do it without knowing first something about
                    the abilities of the people who are now working there.”</p>
                <p>I happened to know the PAO, Len Baldyga, who was there at the time and was a
                    friend of mine who had a very good record, and told Lucey he should keep an open
                    mind about him and others on his staff. So Lucey went to Mexico but six months
                    later he came back to Washington and we had dinner. He said that he had problems
                    with his Country Team, that it seemed that Mexico for many years had been a
                    retirement post. Not much had been going on, but that Mexico was changing. Not
                    only was the population growing rapidly, but they suspected that there was a
                    good deal more oil than had been thought in their offshore reserves. He said
                    that the PAO was a very capable man but that he was laid low with a bad back and
                    that his staff was not really giving the Ambassador the support he needed. He
                    said it was true of virtually the entire Country Team, made up of the heads of
                    key sections and other Agencies. I told him that I had accepted a request by the
                    Agency to go to New York to work for Elliot Richardson, who was going to be
                    Ambassador to the sixth UN conference on the law of the sea. I had agreed to go
                    up there to work for him in Washington and then go up to New York for the
                    session until August, when I was to go into the Senior Seminar in National and
                    International Affairs, a very prestigious year-long assignment. So I said there
                    is no way I would be available. I was already in the 'midst of my senior seminar
                    year, when he came back to Washington. He said he was going to make all the
                    changes he had talked about, including most of the Country Team. He was really
                    fond of Len Baldyga, who went on to very high level assignments including
                    directing our programs in Europe, but thought that Len, whose interest was
                    mainly in Eastern Europe, also might welcome a change. I said that decision was
                    between him and the director of the Agency; that he would have to talk to John
                    Reinhardt, the Director of the Agency under President Carter, and if Reinhardt
                    wanted me to go to Mexico when I finished the Senior Seminar I would. Director
                    Reinhardt agreed to the transfer, so at the end of the senior seminar I went to
                    Mexico.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is during USIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, you were there from '78 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: 1983. It was my longest time at a post, and in retrospect the greatest
                    opportunity I had had in my career to effect changes in perceptions in a
                    complicated country. It was a time of great change in Mexico, in which there was
                    great admiration for our democracy, as well as a strong underlying historical
                    animosity. My time there spanned much of the terms of three ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out there, I mean obviously with a friend,
                        governor Lucey, as ambassador there, you had been hearing about this and
                        all. What were you getting about Lucey and the USIA operation before you
                        went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I knew that he was on very bad terms, not with the PAO who he liked,
                    but with some of the staff. Len had very serious back problems at the time and
                    for much of the time his deputy was running the post. There was a feeling that
                    Ambassador Lucey expected the post to operate as his public affairs staff did
                    when he was governor of Wisconsin, with press releases going out every couple of
                    days. I told him when I heard about it that I thought that was a mistake. But by
                    the time I got there the well had been a bit poisoned and the staff was in the
                    doghouse. They felt that he didn't understand their program, and he felt they
                    didn't understand his needs. It was a bad situation. When I went down, of course
                    I was free to talk to him in a way that other counselors couldn't because they
                    didn't have the long personal friendship with him that I had. I told him that he
                    was probably harming himself by creating too high a profile, by being so
                    prominent in the press, and it would be better to lower it somewhat. He did, and
                    I asked him if would agree to meet with my staff, get to know some of them, and
                    talk about what his problems were and how we could best support him, and let us
                    exchange ideas on that.. He came down and he was pretty strong in stating what
                    he thought we should be doing, laying out a level of activity that sounded like
                    an election campaign. I went to him afterwards to talk it over, without doing it
                    in front of the staff, and told him that there were things we not only shouldn't
                    do but in fact couldn't do. That we would work up a program that will help
                    support the country plan's goals, and also try to help him communicate
                    effectively with the Mexican public because when the U.S. ambassador to Mexico
                    said something, he was listened to. But this also meant he couldn't expect to do
                    that on a daily basis, because it would appear overbearing and meddlesome.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>This was in early September or October, and we were beginning to turn some things
                    around. We had some staff changes. I wanted to bring down a new press
                    attach�/information officer because I thought that was one of the problems. The
                    incumbent was quite competent, but had lost the ambassador's confidence. Lucey
                    was upset because as governor he would travel around Wisconsin with one
                    assistant who would handle press matters and also take notes for thank you
                    letters and the like. But he had too many people traveling with him as
                    ambassador and he thought it was a waste of money. He wanted the press attach�
                    to travel with him but also to serve as an assistant for the note taking. The
                    press attach� thought it wasn't his job to do so, and the ambassador said “Well
                    either the press attach� will help do some staff work for me, or my staff
                    assistant will do the press work.” So the result was we lost a man traveling
                    with the ambassador, which I thought was a setback since I wanted him to support
                    our program and I thought we should do our best to support him. The Agency
                    agreed that I could bring down Larry Ikels, a very able replacement who could do
                    the job, and that problem was resolved. So we were getting things turned around
                    when all of a sudden, we got word that President Carter would be coming to visit
                    in February. You know what a presidential visit means; it displaces all other
                    activity. But in this case the White House descended on us in early December and
                    we were just upside down for the next three months in preparation for that
                    visit. I had worked on President Nixon's visit to Brussels, but although I was a
                    liaison to the White House press people I was not the PAO there. This one was a
                    much bigger event because there was no real problem in our bilateral
                    relationship in Brussels, but in Mexico, the oil issue had become very
                    important.</p>
                <p>The left in Mexico felt that a deal to sell oil and gas to the United States
                    meant bargaining away Mexico's patrimony. Oil concessions had been given to
                    British and American companies in the early part of the 20th century when there
                    were fields discovered in Tampico up on the Caribbean coast. The industry was
                    nationalized by President Lazaro Cardenas who mobilized the oil workers to
                    support his actions. There is a major statue on the upper part of the Avenue
                    Reforma, leading to the upscale neighborhood of Lomas, of Los Petroleros, the
                    oil workers who led the drive to nationalize the oil industry. Oil and Mexican
                    nationalism were identified as being one and the same. So the left raised a
                    storm. Here was Jimmy Carter coming down and the papers were up in arms. “He is
                    coming to steal our oil. They will take our oil; they want to take everything
                    away from us”. We were having country team meetings about the visit, and I said
                    it was getting to be such a confrontational thing that we needed a cultural
                    event of some kind to soften the atmosphere and to try to assure Mexicans that
                    this is not a crisis situation, but a natural feature of a long term
                    relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>At first we proposed that Vladimir Horowitz be invited to come down and play. The
                    White House objected because he had played at the White House and then had
                    released a record that used the White House for what they felt was
                    self-promotion. There were three symphony Orchestras in Mexico City, the
                    National Symphony, the National University Orchestra, and the Mexico City
                    Philharmonic, which was founded by the wife of President Lopez Portillo. It was
                    the best of the three, with internationally recruited members. The president's
                    wife was herself a competent amateur pianist. Mexico was swimming in oil money
                    then, and she had brought in Americans, Russians, Poles, Germans and French and
                    had hired some of the best Mexican instrumentalists as well. It was an
                    international orchestra, although the Mexican conductor was hired because of his
                    friendship with Mrs. Lopez Portillo rather than for his talent. I suggested we
                    ask Leonard Bernstein to conduct a concert with the orchestra, an invitational
                    concert for the business community, diplomatic community, senior officials of
                    the Mexican government, cultural figures and with the two Presidents and their
                    major aides in attendance. I didn't know it at the time but Bernstein had
                    celebrated his honeymoon in Acapulco, and had written “Trouble in Tahiti” while
                    he was vacationing in Mexico. The White House liked the idea, and Bernstein
                    agreed to do it for expenses only. Well we were delighted. Mrs. Lopez Portillo
                    was delighted, although her first choice for a cultural event had been a grand
                    exhibit of American art. I was told by my staff that during the US bicentennial
                    celebration there was an exhibit arranged for travel to three posts, Warsaw,
                    Paris and Mexico, It was called The World of Franklin and Jefferson, and
                    contained splendid displays of that period. It was put on a train to come to
                    Mexico City, but the train could not be found for about four days. It was
                    carrying material borrowed from museums all over the US, and word of that fiasco
                    made the White House back off. So we got Bernstein, but we promised Mrs. Lopez
                    Portillo that we would try to organize an exhibit of American art when we could
                    do so with the proper amount of planning, something that was impossible just
                    before a Presidential visit.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>Bernstein came down, but sent ahead a program for the concert. It consisted of a
                    mix of American and Mexican music. I remember it included the Symphonia Indio by
                    Carlos Chavez, El Salon Mexico by Aaron Copeland, Samuel Barber's Elegy for
                    Strings and would conclude with the Bernstein Symphonic Dances from West Side
                    Story. I was awakened at 2 a.m. shortly after we received the program, by a
                    fiery redhead with the title of ambassador who worked for Mrs. Lopez Portillo.
                    She said, “Who decided on that program?” I said, “Why Leonard Bernstein of
                    course.” “But Mrs. Lopez Portillo was never asked,” she said, and I said, “I
                    don't think that Mr. Bernstein, who is conducting for nothing, and who as the
                    conductor normally chooses the program, was aware that she wished to be
                    consulted.” The Ambassadress said President and Mrs. Lopez Portillo detested
                    West Side Story because it showed the Hispanic population in a poor light. So
                    that selection would have to go, and in any case she wanted the second part of
                    the concert to be a classical symphony, preferably German. I said that that was
                    above my pay grade, and we got Bernstein's agent Harry Kraut to come down to
                    Mexico and to meet with Alfredo Elias, who was nominally the head of a non
                    governmental charitable organization, an organization of Mrs. Lopez Portillo's,
                    but really was a principal advisor to her, to come to my office. He said that
                    the wife of the President had very strong opinions and in Mexico her word was
                    law on cultural matters. Kraut said, “Well I don't know. Lenny was asked to
                    conduct the concert in honor of the 20th anniversary of the consecration of the
                    reign of Pope Paul VI. The Pope's staff sent up a list of music for Lenny to
                    choose from and Lenny told the Pope he would take it under consideration.” Well,
                    Alfredo's face went pale. He got Mrs. Lopez Portillo on the phone and put her on
                    with Kraut, who said, “I don't know. I guess we won't have a concert. I don't
                    know how Lenny feels about this but I will leave it up to him” We thought the
                    whole thing was off, but Bernstein sent word that he would take the West Side
                    Story waltz's off the program and perform Beethoven's Fifth Symphony instead. I
                    couldn't believe it, but the fact was that he understood Mexico. He understood
                    that this was important, and didn't want to create a diplomatic incident. He
                    came down and he conducted a wonderful concert before a packed house of some of
                    the most important people in Mexico, with the two presidents sitting there with
                    their secretaries of state and national security advisors in the presidential
                    box and the diplomatic corps, the cultural elite of Mexico, and Mexican and
                    American business leaders filling the theater..</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>At the end of the concert, Bernstein took a great bow, walked off in his
                    resplendent white cutaway, and the applause continued awaiting his return for
                    more bows. But instead, the orchestra's regular conductor appeared in a business
                    suit and led the orchestra in the two national anthems and the concert came to a
                    close. Afterwards there was a dinner at the ambassador's house with Lopez
                    Portillo and Bernstein having a contest as to who could start a Latin American
                    song that the other one couldn't finish. It went on until 1 a.m. After the
                    dinner, I wanted Elias to meet Bernstein, and we went to the Presidential suite
                    which the government had provided him in a superb hotel. Bernstein came in and
                    told Elias that the orchestra's conductor had pushed his way past him in the
                    wings of the stage, blocking him from returning for a bow and from having the
                    orchestra receive a standing ovation as well. : “That conductor should be
                    fired,” he said, “not because of what he did to me, but because he does not love
                    music.”</p>
                <p>You could tell the experience was a wonderful one for the orchestra, and they
                    really played their hearts out. They never sounded so good. Anyway, a year or so
                    later, Mrs. Lopez Portillo reminded us that we had promised to follow through on
                    a major art exhibit. We negotiated it and the Mexicans promised to bear a good
                    share of the cost in security, transportation, a lot of things. So I went to
                    Washington and told them we have to follow through on this. The Mexican
                    relationship was becoming so important; oil and immigration, trade and drugs
                    were major bilateral issues. There were so many issues that Lucey suggested that
                    a meeting be held in Washington with the agencies that had interests and
                    responsibilities for aspects of our relationship with Mexico. He went up there
                    and he called me and said: “You want to know what happened when I walked into
                    that room? There were 70 people there. Virtually every agency of the U.S.
                    government had some part of this.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also telephone and personal relationships that completely
                        bypass the embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: That happened a little later in Mexico, but I experienced that in
                    Canada, where the embassy was a bystander, where EPA, you know they were buddies
                    with their counterparts in the US. We started a series of binational meetings
                    that involved the foreign minister and elements of Mexico's bureaucracy and ours
                    that interfaced, from law enforcement to immigration to commerce to customs to
                    agriculture to EPA, all of them. It was and still is a very intense interaction.
                    And more so now of course since NAFTA. I remember one of my professors at SAIS,
                    Isaiah Frank, a former deputy assistant secretary for economic affairs, stopped
                    me on the street one day while I was visiting Washington. and said, “You know, a
                    group of us floated this idea, maybe you have seen it. A group of us got
                    together about the wisdom of looking for a free trade relationship with Mexico.”
                    I said, I didn't think it was politically possible at that time. I meant that
                    they would see it as another attempt by the United States to dominate Mexico,
                    draw it further away from Latin America to North America, which it was
                    geographically but not culturally or emotionally part of, but saw itself as
                    distinctly different from the US-Canadian relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>Well it became a fact much sooner than I would have guessed. It became a fact not
                    just because of significant changes in the Mexican government, but in the
                    Mexican population. Mexico was slowly but surely developing a population of
                    middle class, educated people, who cold no longer abide not having the political
                    freedom that should go along with the responsibilities they were holding in the
                    private sector. This is a development that we may be seeing happen much more
                    slowly in China. I am hoping it goes in the same direction. I do remember that
                    one of the first people I really got to know in the academic community in Mexico
                    was Pedro Aspe, who was then professor of economics, head of the economics
                    department at a private university that was set up by the business community to
                    counter the Marxist economic approach that the national university and most of
                    the universities in Mexico preferred. This was not true of the Instituto
                    Tecnol�gico de Monterrey or of several others. Aspe's students at ITAM, the
                    Autonomous Technological Independent University of Mexico, were receiving a
                    thoroughly modern education in economics and other social sciences. He told me
                    he was graduating 48 students with majors in economics that year, of whom 26 had
                    been accepted into first rate Ph.D. programs in the United States. They continue
                    year after year, and other universities, other private universities began
                    following suit.</p>
                <p>My wife taught at one of them, the University of the Americas in Cholula, outside
                    of Puebla. Monterrey Tech was also turning out people with solid foundations in
                    economics, and these people were going into first rate universities in the
                    United States. The Minister of Agriculture was a graduate of the University of
                    Wisconsin, and formed a Wisconsin alumni association when Pat Lucey was there.
                    He borrowed a plane from Lopez Portillo's fleet to fly a bunch of people up to a
                    homecoming football game in Madison. In any case, Aspe later became Minister of
                    Finance under Miguel de la Madrid. So the country has really begun to
                    change.</p>
                <p>To get back to Mrs. Lopez Portillo and the art exhibit, the Agency agreed and put
                    up some money, but the Mexicans put up more. We agreed that to succeed, the
                    exhibit needed a first rate curator. We decided it would be an exhibit of works
                    from the five great museums of Washington, including the National Gallery, the
                    Phillips. The Corcoran Gallery, the Museum of American Art, and the National
                    Portrait Gallery. It was decided in Washington that the right man was professor
                    emeritus of art history at the City University of New York, a prominent educator
                    named Milton Brown. He was a wonderful gentleman. He came down and a group of us
                    took him out to eat at a very traditional Mexican restaurant, Cafe Tacuba. We
                    got to talking and I said, “Where are you from?' He said, “New York.” I said,
                    “Yes, I know, but where in New York.” He said, “Brooklyn.” I said, “Where in
                    Brooklyn?” He said, “Bensonhurst.” I said, “Where in Bensonhurst?' He said, “Bay
                    Parkway.” I said, “Where on Bay Parkway?” He said “The intersection of Bay
                    Parkway and Bath Avenue.” I said, “Which corner?” He had grown up diagonally
                    across from me a generation earlier. Every store I knew by one name he knew by
                    another.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>He did a wonderful job. He talked those Washington museums into taking things off
                    their walls that had never left the United States before, never even left those
                    museums before. Samuel F.B. Morse's huge portrait of the House of
                    Representatives in the Corcoran, a great work historically and very important,
                    was one of them. It and 89 other works starting from the colonial period up to
                    Diebenkorn, hung at the Palace of Fine Arts for three months. The director of
                    the Agency, John Reinhardt, came down to represent the President at the opening,
                    and it was formally opened by the president of Mexico and his wife. The next
                    president of Mexico was also there, but we didn't know who he was. But we knew
                    he was there because he would be chosen by the outgoing President from among the
                    cabinet members, all of whom were also there.</p>
                <p>The exhibit enjoyed great success and drew large crowds, but being Mexico, it was
                    criticized by the left for not exhibiting this artist or that artist or whoever.
                    Mexico, I decided was one of the two countries where art was really politics.
                    The other one is France. Mexico is like that. There were 16,000 working artists
                    in Mexico at that time and many great museums. The Anthropology Museum of Mexico
                    is the greatest of its kind in the world. The Museum of Modern Art is a
                    wonderful museum. The visual arts are not my field; I was more interested in
                    music, having played piano from childhood, but I really got an education, not
                    only in the arts, the plastic and visual arts, but in the life style of artists,
                    who in Mexico are deeply involved in politics as well as in the arts, and more
                    revered by their countrymen than in any other country that I'm familiar
                    with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find in Mexico as in France that there is an
                        intelligentsia, you know a group that sits around in cafes essentially but
                        has great influence, somewhat of that nature or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Not in areas of policy that in most countries, including Mexico, were
                    critical. The Mexican system at the time was very cynical. The PRI, the
                    Institutional Revolutionary party of Mexico, had been in power longer than any
                    other party in the world at that time except the Communist Party of the Soviet
                    Union. Eventually it was in power longer than the CPSU. After the revolution
                    there was great infighting and war between generals who finally made peace on a
                    cynical basis. That was the agreement that the president would serve for six
                    years but could not be re-elected. What that meant was everybody would get his
                    turn at the trough. The manner in which the powers came to be exercised involved
                    the guarantee of government control of the key sectors of power. They controlled
                    the economy through the ministry of finance. They controlled the ministry of the
                    interior, which meant not what we mean by the ministry of the interior, the
                    geological wealth, the mines, and the public parks. They are talking about the
                    police, internal control, the army, forces of control when needed. Those things
                    were the keys to power. The left, the people who sit around in cafes and
                    complain, were allowed to play with the educational system, the media (as long
                    as it never criticized the president), and foreign policy. Those areas were the
                    playgrounds of the intellectuals of the left.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have been told that the foreign office was sort of the
                        playground of the left because it didn't mean that much in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: That is right, at least not for a long time. When I was there,
                    nationalism was a major element in Mexican's relations with us. Everybody in
                    public life had to be nationalistic, to ensure that they were perceived as
                    defenders of La Patria. But to some it was a calling; to others it was
                    performance. The Mexican school textbooks were outrageous in some respects. We
                    tried to undertake a program in which we would comment on each other's books'
                    treatment of each other's society and history. The official who dealt with us on
                    the textbook issue was actually one of the more sophisticated people in the
                    Ministry of Education, but it was clearly a matter of great sensitivity within
                    the educational community. We had some pro forma meetings and discussions, and
                    we turned sets of some representative US high school social studies texts over
                    to them. But we could never get them to turn their books over to us, although we
                    were able to buy them in the open market. Then we sent them commentaries not by
                    the State Department, but by American educators. They said “Thanks very much.” I
                    don't think anybody ever read them.</p>
                <p>Outside of the sacrosanct areas like education or criticism of the president,
                    there was a great deal of political freedom in Mexico. There were outrageous
                    things in the Mexican press, as long as the limits were observed. There was a
                    close contact of mine at the time who was director of the Institute of Fine
                    Arts, although he was a career diplomat. His name was Juan Jose Bremer who later
                    became Mexican Ambassador to the United States. But he suffered a terrible blow
                    when somebody got access at night to the periodic newsletter that the Institute
                    put out and surreptitiously inserted a scurrilous story about the Grand Poobah
                    who was the Great Whore of Mexico that was recognized as a thinly disguised
                    description of the President's wife. He was fired on the spot and was sent off
                    to the frozen wastes (as the Mexicans pictured it) as Ambassador to Sweden. His
                    career was apparently ruined, but his resurrection as Ambassador to Germany and
                    to the US proves that Mexico has changed, at least to the extent that one
                    administration doesn't feel obliged to punish those who have been castigated by
                    a previous one. You could not take on the president or the first lady with
                    impunity. That was the limit, but within that you had wide ranges of views in
                    the Mexican press, and it ranged from left to right. The PRI tried to enfold all
                    of these tendencies within its house. There was a left wing of the PRI and a
                    center and a right. The left wing was represented by a newspaper called El Dia
                    that was run by an extremely interesting man named Enrique Ramirez y Ramirez. We
                    surprisingly became friends. There was growing interest, particularly along the
                    border but even beyond that, among American newspapers about what was going on
                    in Mexico. But they didn't know Mexico. There were a few correspondents in
                    Mexico City at the time. Alan Riding, an Englishman, was there from the New York
                    Times. He really knew Mexico, he and his Dutch wife Marlise Simmons, who was
                    corresponding for the Washington Post. There were correspondents from both
                    Dallas papers, and of course the US wire services were represented. The smaller
                    towns along the border and the larger cities nearby, like San Antonio or San
                    Diego, knew something of Mexico but mostly at the border. They didn't know the
                    real Mexico, which was Mexico City.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>I thought we needed to get media people together, and I called my friend Dick
                    Leonard, the editor of the Milwaukee Journal, who also happened to be at the
                    time president of the International Press Institute. I asked if they would
                    co-sponsor with us a meeting between Mexican and American editors and
                    publishers, suggesting that it could be held at the Wingspread Foundation in
                    Racine, which was built by Frank Lloyd Wright as a home for the Johnson Wax
                    family but had become a conference center for the Foundation. Now the Mexicans
                    knew Miami. They knew Houston, San Diego and Los Angeles, and some of them knew
                    New York. But they really didn't get very deep into the United States, certainly
                    not into Wisconsin. Leonard was very interested and I was trying to then round
                    up Mexicans to participate while Dick Leonard was trying to get a list of
                    Americans to come along. He turned up a very impressive list of Americans, of
                    American publishers and editors. I was having trouble with the Mexican left.</p>
                <p>I didn't want to have just the more business oriented papers. I went to Ramirez y
                    Ramirez, the publisher of the most leftist newspaper in the country, the
                    newspaper of the PRI's left wing, and he readily agreed to come. Once he agreed,
                    everybody on the left then had cover. So another editor I was friendly with,
                    Manuel Becerra Acosta, who was the editor of Unomasuno which was the newspaper
                    that all the UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico) professors read,
                    also agreed to come. These people were not overtly pro PRI, but gladly took the
                    party's subsidies. They were emotionally for the PRD which was a socialist
                    party. There was also the PAN which was a party which had its base in the north,
                    a Catholic, conservative opposition party which eventually gained the presidency
                    and shattered the PRI's monopoly. There were influential papers in Monterey, the
                    largest city of the north, who also came along. We flew to Chicago with
                    difficulty. American Airlines graciously set aside the front rows of the cabin
                    class section for our distinguished guests. The United States government never
                    paid for business class for anybody, except for the first trip of ambassadors to
                    their post. Other than that it was steerage class. But these guys were up in
                    front and of course they all smoked as they would have on Mexicana Airlines. At
                    the time, smoking was allowed only in the rear of the plane, but thankfully
                    somehow the other passengers got the word and didn't complain.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>Well we got to Chicago and we were whisked through immigration and customs with
                    the help of pre-advised airport authorities, and had a very comfortable bus
                    waiting to drive us to Racine, a drive of an hour or so. Mexicans are a very
                    voluble people, and they were deep in discussions until we got out into the
                    snowy March fields, at which time they fell silent as we entered through a
                    landscape with which they were totally unfamiliar, with farmlands covered with
                    snow, and farmhouses, simple white farmhouses and silos. They were fascinated. I
                    think they were impressed by both the silence of the scene, and by the neatness
                    and sturdiness of the farmlands and the image it conveyed of an organized
                    agricultural society. We got into Racine and we went to the Howard Johnson
                    hotel, which was the closest lodging we could find to the Johnson Center. We had
                    a reception that night with the American editors and with distinguished people
                    from Milwaukee before the blazing, three story fireplace that dominated the
                    great room of Wingspread. We had a great three days. Ramirez y Ramirez gave a
                    talk that people still talk about on why there is a difference in how Mexicans
                    and Americans viewed the world, of how their greatly different historical
                    experiences had brought this about. We had both Ambassadors speak, Lucey and
                    Hugo Margain, Mexican ambassador to the US. We had speakers from several
                    universities, and American newspaper publishers and editors spoke as well. The
                    two delegations really hit it off, although there were some cultural shocks. We
                    drove into Milwaukee to have dinner as guests of the Milwaukee Press Club. We
                    drove in along the freeway at about 6:30 p.m., when everybody who worked
                    downtown was already home eating dinner. The Mexicans looked out on the city
                    which to them looked like it had been hit by a neutron bomb. They said, “Where
                    is everybody?” You know they are used to crowds in Mexico like in China or
                    Japan, where the streets are always crowded. And when we arrived at the Press
                    Club there was an organized demonstration by some group because of some recent
                    Mexican injustice, which they took in good stride.</p>
                <p>They then insisted on reciprocating the following year. They invited Mexican and
                    American editors and publishers to come down to Mexico City with their wives,
                    that was something we couldn't do, and took us to a resort outside of the city.
                    This was at a time when Mexico was swimming in oil money. Every night there was
                    a different meal at a different restaurant with different gifts for the ladies.
                    It was so splendid; it was way beyond the means provided by our representational
                    funds. Then it ended back in Mexico City with a visit to Los Pinos, the Mexican
                    White House, and an audience with President Lopez Portillo.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>The next year was to be our turn again, and we knew we couldn't compete with the
                    sumptuous offerings of the Mexicans, who merely had to contact Los Pinos or
                    Pemex and the money would be forthcoming. We decided to have the next meeting in
                    Washington. This was now the Reagan administration. Pat Lucey had left towards
                    the end of the Carter administration. He was on the outs with President Carter,
                    feeling that Carter had left the liberal part of the party behind, and he
                    resigned to campaign for Ted Kennedy when Kennedy decided to challenge the
                    President's re-election bid. Carter did offer him at that point either of two
                    cabinet positions which Lucey turned down. He was replaced by Julian Nava whose
                    father was Mexican born. Julian Nava had a Ph.D. from Harvard, was on the Los
                    Angeles school board, and served for the remainder of Carter's term. President
                    Reagan designated John Gavin, who was well known for his career as a movie
                    actor, to be ambassador to Mexico. He had not yet been confirmed, but I called
                    him and asked, because apparently he was a good friend of the President's, if he
                    could help get us into the White House for at least a briefing by somebody on
                    Mexican-American relations and, if at all possible, some sort of access to the
                    new President. He said he would try.</p>
                <p>We had the meeting in Washington here at a conference center and it went very
                    well. We were hosted for lunch in Congress by Clem Zablocki, chairman of the
                    House Foreign Affairs committee and an old friend from Wisconsin. But we weren't
                    sure we could get into the White House until, at the last minute, it came
                    through because of Gavin's efforts. One result was to increase my respect for
                    the skill of people with an acting background to do things that had great
                    psychological meaning to an audience. John Gavin, many people didn't recognize
                    this, was part Mexican. His mother was from Sonora, and she came from a family
                    of Californios, people who were in California when it was still Spanish. Gavin
                    spoke exquisite Spanish, and could do so in a Mexican accent or a Castilian one.
                    Lucey, although he didn't speak Spanish, had a lot of clout in Mexico because
                    they knew he could call the President without having to go through the State
                    Department. He got three or four votes out of the U.S. Senate when they were
                    needed to pass the prisoner exchange bill, and did it on the phone. That was
                    more important to the Mexican government than whether or not Lucey could speak
                    Spanish, although it did limit his access to non-English speaking Mexicans.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>For some reason, they weren't immediately impressed by Ambassador Gavin's Spanish
                    ability because they resented the fact that he was an actor. They joked about
                    sending the Mexican comedian Cantinflas to America as ambassador. They were
                    forgetting that President Reagan himself was an actor, a fact that Gavin would
                    mention now and then. And Gavin had made the contact that got our group of
                    Mexican and American editors and publishers into the White House. We were
                    ushered into the cabinet room, to be briefed by Richard Allen, who was then the
                    National Security Advisor. Gavin was acting as master of ceremonies introducing
                    him. The briefing began and continued for a while and then, as if it were by
                    accident, the door opened, the connecting door to the Oval Office, and President
                    Reagan came in. The editors got up, and even some of the most left-wing Mexicans
                    rose and seemed genuinely impressed by being so near the President. He said,
                    “Oh,” as if he were surprised, and apologized: “I didn't want to interrupt your
                    meeting. Jack,” he said, and added, “could you come into my office when you're
                    finished. I want to talk about something.” Well that sent the signal to the
                    Mexican editors that the ambassador they were getting was as close to this
                    president as Pat Lucey had been to Carter, if not more so. It was a very shrewd
                    way to handle the situation. The Mexicans were already planning a follow-up
                    meeting for the next year, but before the time came the Mexican peso went from
                    22 to a dollar to 200 to a dollar in one day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ouch!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Mexico was devastated because oil prices collapsed. They were
                    borrowing money based on the expectation of oil at $40 a barrel, as it is now.
                    But in those days it rarely passed $20 and was usually less. The debts they had
                    incurred from the banks, that also had the expectation of $40 to the barrel as
                    collateral, could not be paid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stan, I think this is a good place to stop. We have a lot
                        to cover. This is going to keep on for awhile. I would like you to talk
                        about working with the various ambassadors, their styles and how they
                        affected you. Then talk about your impressions of the two Presidents you
                        worked with, Portillo and de la Madrid, and your dealings with the
                        government, the effect of the peso collapse, the oil thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>All right we will mention a number of things. Maybe we will kick this off. How
                    about your ambassadors, how they used you and your impression of how they
                    operated.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well as I mentioned, when I got there, I got there knowing the
                    incumbent ambassador who had already been there for a year and a half, Patrick
                    J. Lucey, who had resigned the governorship of Wisconsin to take the
                    ambassadorship. There was no need to get to know each other. We had worked
                    together when he was the Democratic Party chairman of Wisconsin, and stayed in
                    touch over the years. We would see each other when he came to Washington during
                    my time there or whenever I was in Wisconsin. When he arrived in Mexico he
                    brought along with him a young man, Bob Dunn, who had been his chief of staff
                    for a while, and then became director of administration of the State of
                    Wisconsin. He was a lawyer by training, a very capable person and served as
                    Lucey's special assistant. So it was a very pleasant environment in. which to
                    work.</p>
                <p>Lucey also had changed a good part of the country team. We were all new to the
                    post. John Ferch, with a strong background as an economics officer and in Latin
                    America, was the DCM. At that time he was easily the best DCM I had ever worked
                    for. He really excelled in keeping close touch with every government agency
                    represented in that very large embassnot just the immediate foreign affairs
                    family but a very extended family of U.S. agencies. He had regular quarterly
                    meetings with every head of agency to prepare briefing papers for the Ambassador
                    on how things were going and what problems each one faced. It was a remarkably
                    good country team. The meetings, the staff meetings were very workmanlike, very
                    issue-oriented, who was doing what or what was coming up and what was the
                    ambassador needed for.</p>
                <p>Although Ambassador Lucey didn't speak Spanish, he did try to learn and had
                    mastered the usual polite phrases. Years later he told me a story that, after he
                    left Mexico, he was invited to a very important wedding in Milwaukee, and was
                    asked by the family of the marriage couple if he would join them in receiving
                    their guests on the receiving line. A lady passing through said, in very
                    American-accented Spanish, “Buenos Dias; como esta Ambassador Lucey.?” And he
                    said, “Muy bien y usted?” She turned to her husband and said, “You see, I told
                    you he spoke fluent Spanish.” He loved to tell stories on himself. Pat Lucey was
                    a very interesting man. He was born in a tiny town in western Wisconsin called
                    Ferryville, on the Mississippi River near La Crosse. His father was a butcher
                    who owned a number of farms. Lucey was, among other things, an expert meat
                    cutter, and also helped manage the farms. He had a Catholic education and
                    graduated from Campion College in Minnesota. Two of his brothers were priests,
                    one sister was a nun. Lucey was a Catholic liberal of the Jack Kennedy or Eugene
                    McCarthy variety. He had very deep feelings about social justice. He and John
                    Reynolds, the governor I worked for, helped organize the Wisconsin Democratic
                    Party which had been the third party in the state of Wisconsin. The voters'
                    decision was made in the Republican primary, which was always a contest between
                    the Stalwarts and the Progressives of the old Robert Lafollette tradition. Joe
                    McCarthy drove the Progressives out of the Republican Party and they took over
                    the Democratic party and made it a party which eventually elected William
                    Proxmire as senator, Gaylord Nelson as governor, John Reynolds as attorney
                    General and then governor, and Pat Lucey as governor, so it is a thriving two
                    party state now. He came out of that tradition.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>I saw him after the Carter victory, for which he had worked hard and succeeded in
                    delivering the Wisconsin vote, just as he and John Reynolds had put together the
                    Kennedy campaign in Wisconsin. We talked abut what if anything he wanted to do
                    in the Carter administration. He had just been re-elected to his second term as
                    governor, but he said that his great focus of interest was on how the world was
                    going to manage what was then seen as a crises of too many people and not enough
                    food, and he wanted to play a role in managing that. Well we don't talk about it
                    much now because food doesn't seem to be a problem in much of the world given
                    the green revolution, given surpluses of the producing countries. He was on a
                    short list for two cabinet positions, which went to others, but he was offered
                    the ambassadorship to Mexico and, to everybody's surprise, he accepted it,
                    resigning the governorship in the middle of his four-year term, because he felt
                    that Mexico was as close as he could come to addressing his focus of
                    interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how about as a Catholic and dealing with population,
                        because basically when you are talking about population you are talking
                        about restricting it, I mean if you can.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: He doesn't have those problems. His views were pretty much like
                    Senator Kerry's announced views today, that whatever he thinks of abortion
                    personally, he believes it is not an area where the government should control a
                    woman's choice. So he had never had any problems on that score. In Mexico his
                    relations were very good with President Lopez Portillo who was thought to be an
                    intellectual, and who had been a professor of law who the PRI felt might add a
                    touch of class to the presidency. My golfing partner was a Mexican who was
                    sitting out the Lopez Portillo administration after having worked in the Banco
                    Rural, the agricultural bank, for President Luis Echeverria, who preceded Lopez
                    Portillo. After the Carter visit in February, 1979, when Lopez Portillo insulted
                    President Carter to his face, I felt that Lopez Portillo could have been elected
                    by a landslide in a totally free election. He was very popular because he stood
                    up to the Gringo president. This friend of mine said, “When he leaves office he
                    will be the most hated president in Mexican history, because I know how much we
                    stole when we were in office, and the guy who has taken my job is stealing 2
                    million dollars a month. I have that on good sources. And if he is stealing at
                    that low level, you can imagine what is going on at the top.”</p>
                <p>Well Lopez Portillo was estimated to have amassed a fortune of over six billion
                    dollars by the time he left office. Nonetheless, the venality of the regime was
                    not thought by any of us to be different than what normally took place in
                    Mexican sexennials, particularly in the last year of the administration's term.
                    And despite the turmoil that occurs as the Mexican president's term reaches an
                    end, there were still a number of issues that needed addressing, in which the
                    Mexicans were very happy to have a person with the kinds of contacts in
                    Washington that Pat Lucey had, including the prisoner exchange bill that I spoke
                    of earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that American prisoners in Mexican
                        jails, I mean there was a reverse side, but speaking strictly form the
                        American side, yes there has always been a real problem for us because you
                        know, an awful lot of people get caught in drug things and all. A lot of
                        young people get caught in the system, and it is a difficult system to play
                        with, the legal system, you know, who do you pay off or not and how you are
                        treated and then you are kind of left on your own once you are in jail.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well there were more Mexicans by far in American jails than there were
                    Americans in Mexican jails. Partly for the reasons you mentioned, there were
                    extra judicial means of avoiding a prison sentence in Mexico, at least to a
                    greater extent than might have been true in the U.S. But in that and on other
                    issues, Lucey was of great help to the Mexicans in explaining to them how
                    bilateral issues could be managed. He liked to do it without getting involved
                    with the Mexican proclivity to shout first and negotiate afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape five, side one with Stan Zuckerman. You were
                        talking about Lucey being on good terms with the foreign minister.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes. Santiago Roel was a politician himself from northern Mexico, from
                    around Nuevo Laredo. They saw eye to eye on the need to improve US-Mexican
                    relations, and when problems arose at lower levels of the relationship, where we
                    would deal with our counterparts in the foreign ministry, Lucey had no problem
                    in picking up the phone and trying to work out a solution. One day I was at the
                    Ambassador's residence, waiting downstairs to leave with him to some event, when
                    the phone rang and kept ringing. So I picked it up and a voice said: “Patrick,
                    this is Santiago”. I explained that the Ambassador was getting ready to leave
                    but that I would have him return the call as soon as he came down. They were
                    pretty obviously on close personal terms.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>As for our own interactions, we dealt with a number of different elements of the
                    foreign ministry, particularly the North American desk, the education ministry,
                    the universities and the cultural entities, as well as, of course, with the
                    media. The cultural entities were not at the cabinet level but were very
                    important in Mexican life, particularly the Institute of Fine Arts which managed
                    the musical and plastic arts. The Prime Minister who succeeded Roel, Jorge
                    Castaneda, had a son named Jorge Castaneda junior who later became foreign
                    minister under president Vicente Fox, the current president. He also had a
                    stepson, Andres Rosenthal, who was the American desk officer at that time. He
                    was educated at the University of Pennsylvania. Like me he had an Argentine
                    wife, spoke perfect English, and was very Americanized. As a consequence,
                    because he looked so European and had studied in the US, he bent over backwards
                    to make sure his nationalistic credentials were in order. His, mother was a
                    Russian Jew who, I was told, had served as a translator for Soviet UN Ambassador
                    Vishinsky. Andres was a sophisticated and smart diplomat who later became deputy
                    foreign minister. But on such stormy issues as immigration, which was a major
                    part of the bilateral problem, he gave no quarter. The flow of Mexican
                    immigrants to the United States was of great importance to Mexicans, not only
                    because they had a natural interest in the well-being of their citizens, but
                    those �migr�s relieved, by their access to the American labor market, the
                    pressure on Mexico to find jobs for their ever increasing population. Those
                    workers also were a very strong source of hard currency for the Mexican
                    government, because Mexican laborers, as do most Latin American laborers who
                    come to the United States, sent remarkably high portions of their earnings back
                    to their families. So they were very sophisticated in turning our complaints
                    against us. They were quite right in saying there would be no huge flow of
                    Mexican migrants into the United States labor market were it not for the demand.
                    Of course we passed legislation which put the onus on the employer for making
                    sure that a person had credentials, believing that businessmen respected the law
                    and wouldn't violate it. Well it did nothing at all to change the flow, and the
                    Mexicans were not going to help us. We were asking them to help stem the flow
                    that was of importance and of benefit to their country, and they were not about
                    to. So unless we really want to build a wall along 2000 miles of our border with
                    Mexico, we have had to learn to live with the immigration problem, with what we
                    call illegal and what they call undocumented workers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are sticking to the Lucey period right now. How did
                        Lucey deal with this?</hi>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: He dealt with it straightforwardly, stated our needs, stated our
                    position but was realistic about it. He told his counterparts in the American
                    government in the INS and in the State Department and to the President himself
                    that unless we really were able to get American employers to observe the law,
                    and to vigorously monitor the working papers and the status of the people they
                    employed, there would be no end to the problem. Unless we truly wanted to arm
                    the border outside of the several crossing points at which we do make major
                    efforts, it wasn't going to hold. I went up north for a visit to the border east
                    of Tijuana in the San Diego area, and it was an extraordinary sight. I was
                    driven at night along the top of sort of a levee by the border patrol. They
                    suddenly turned on the spot lights on top of their vehicles and there, in this
                    vast field, there were hundreds and hundreds of Mexicans huddled, sitting there
                    waiting for the time when there would be nobody at that crossing point, and they
                    could run across. We have put up fences now, and it has driven the border
                    crossers further east of Tijuana, further west of Ciudad Juarez and further west
                    of Brownsville.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is extremely inhospitable country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Very dangerous country, and yet they come. We held a conference, I had
                    mentioned this last time we met, in Wisconsin at Wingspread of American and
                    Mexican publishers and editors. One of the American participants was the then
                    director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Lionel Castillo, who was
                    himself of Mexican descent. He told a story directed at both the Mexicans and at
                    the American participants about a young man from the deep interior of Mexico,
                    around Oaxaca, who was picked up at the border and put on a bus back to Mexico.
                    The young man was about 12 or 13 years old. They sent him all the way back to
                    Oaxaca. The first time he was picked up in the Tijuana area. The second time
                    they picked him up again in Juarez. Somehow they realized he was the same kid.
                    They had fairly good records, and they sent him back home again. The picked him
                    up a third time and again sent him back home. After that they never saw him
                    again. Castillo said, “I am certain he kept trying until he made it. As I think
                    on it, it is Mexico's loss and our gain. Any kid of that age who had that kind
                    of fortitude and that kind of desire to come to this country and work, is going
                    to make it.” And it is the story of American history. We get the best. The
                    people with the greatest desire, the greatest energy to improve their lives come
                    to us. When Mexico can keep those people, Mexico will have a better future.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned I think it was Lucey's chief of staff, named
                        Dunn I think it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Bob Dunn.</p>

                        other words, was Dunn used as somebody to keep sort of the embassy away from
                        the ambassador or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Not at all. Dunn was used as a contact for Lucey with certain people
                    in the business community as well as with a number of government officials. He
                    had a law degree, had been Director of Administration for the State of
                    Wisconsin, and after working in the Carter White House became director of
                    communications for Levi Straus. He's now the head of a non-profit dedicated to
                    encouraging ethical behavior in American business. He was not a typical
                    political watchdog without anything to offer the process. On the contrary, he
                    was a valuable asset. He tried to maintain cordial contact with the American
                    Chamber of Commerce in Mexico, the oldest and probably the biggest in the world
                    of American expatriates at the time, who were of course very important in
                    Mexico. Lucey incurred their wrath because they were lobbying Congress, with
                    other American Chambers of Commerce abroad, for an increase in the deductibility
                    of foreign earnings from their US income tax. They though that Lucey, given his
                    political clout, could be a great help to them with Carter, as he probably could
                    have been. But he declined to help, because he thought they were adequately
                    protected against double taxation, that they were living quite well, and that it
                    was unfair to distort the tax code even further than it already was.</p>
                <p>This caused him some problems when some unnamed members of the American community
                    in Mexico bad mouthed him in the Wall Street Journal, saying he was not doing
                    well as Ambassador but never mentioning what the real issue was. It was followed
                    by a very hostile story in the Los Angeles Times saying that he was doing a
                    disastrous job in Mexico. He got word from friends, who didn't know if it was
                    true, that the source of the story might have been Bob Strauss, then head of the
                    Democratic National Committee. Lucey had had some rough dealings with Strauss,
                    especially during the 1960 convention when LBJ and John F. Kennedy were
                    contesting the nomination down to the bitter end. The story was a very
                    embarrassing one and, to anyone who knew the facts, clearly false. He called me
                    up to his office to discuss it and asked what he could do about it. I said that
                    if he had some powerful friends who could go to the New York Times or Los
                    Angeles Times to dispute the story, that could help. But my concern was the
                    effect it could have on his ability to do his job in Mexico and the danger of
                    having Mexicans feel that his job was on his way out.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>We had mixed relations with Excelsior, which was the leading paper at the time.
                    They were a mixed bag. They had some very hostile left wing commentators, but
                    every once in awhile we would get a decent editorial. More often than not, they
                    were stridently nationalistic. I called up the editor and offered Excelsior an
                    exclusive interview with the Ambassador, something they had long sought, but
                    only if they agreed that it would be conducted by a columnist we knew who was
                    usually very straightforward and not a flag waving hyper-nationalist as were
                    most of their stable. He wasn't a big fan of ours, but was even handed, and the
                    editor agreed. He came to the Embassy the next day and conducted a very
                    far-reaching interview on the major bilateral issues on our agenda. We always
                    used as a basic tenet of our position vis a vis Mexico that there was no issue
                    that one could point to in which the American position did not reflect the best
                    interests of Mexico including, in the long run, immigration. The next morning
                    Excelsior's front page had an eight column banner headline, a picture of Lucey
                    and a story that ran half the front page and another inside page. It contained
                    the most accurate, well balanced, thoughtful, thorough exploration of American
                    policy that we had ever seen in a Mexican newspaper. Lucey got phone calls
                    immediately from the Mexican desk in Washington, which saw Excelsior the same
                    day as we did, congratulating him, and told him they were reproducing it for the
                    American press. They told him the story just shut the door on any discussion on
                    how he was doing in Mexico. So he was very gratified. The story that ran in the
                    L.A. Times didn't take hold in Mexico, and it allowed him to do his job without
                    having to look over his shoulder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reason I asked is I have talked to other people who
                        have served at various times there and they were saying Mrs. Lucey was a
                        problem. Was there a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well, I'll be seeing Ambassador and Mrs. Lucey next week in Wisconsin.
                    They are both 86; their birthdays are a couple of weeks apart. Mrs. Lucey is a
                    very outspoken Greek-American woman who was equally outspoken when he was
                    governor. He was a liberal and she held a number of conservative views on social
                    issues. They have had a marriage that has lasted 60 years or so. Yes, she is
                    outspoken, but she did not create problems with the press or Mexican contacts,
                    and was a gracious hostess. I think the problem is one that many staffs have
                    with ambassador's wives who are demanding about their furnishings, their house,
                    the staff and other matters that affect her life and her ability to fulfill her
                    responsibilities. In all the years I have known her I've never had a problem,
                    except for her objection to my cigars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever find yourself because you were close to Lucey
                        called in to kind of cool things down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Between them? No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, not between the two of them, but I mean I am thinking
                        between the embassy staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I can't remember any. Like most ambassador's wives she usually got her
                    way. If she was asking for something that was not feasible, the ambassador would
                    tell her to drop it. He took the heat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I mean policy wise they were both on the same
                        wavelength. Sometimes you have an ambassador's wife who is riding a hobby
                        horse...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: No. She never spoke publicly. They entertained a great deal and she
                    certainly knew people in the business community. She was a very important
                    contributor to the success of the real estate business that she and Ambassador
                    Lucey established in Wisconsin. She also got on well with the Roels and other
                    important contacts of the Ambassador. Sometimes, if they had no official
                    dinners, they would invite an English-speaking couple over to a small dinner,
                    and that included the great Mexican artist Ruffino Tamayo and the Nobel Laureate
                    Octavio Paz.</p>
                <p>Lucey was and remains a man of genuine intellectual interests. He is also the
                    most remarkable political organizer I ever met. When John Kennedy was having
                    problems with the disarray of the Democratic Party in Ohio, he asked Lucey to go
                    in there and see what he could do to straighten them out. Senator Young was
                    elected to the Senate at an extreme age by pledging he would serve only one
                    term. Because he was only going to serve one term he was very frank with voters.
                    He would get letters complaining of his votes and answer them by writing: “Dear
                    Sir. Some idiot has written me a letter and signed your name to it. I feel I
                    should warn you that someone is using your name in an effort to embarrass you.”
                    Well he decided he loved the job so much he wanted to run again. He showed Lucey
                    those letters and said, “My God what am I going to do about these.” Lucey said,
                    “Let's put them together and publish them as a campaign book.” He did, and he
                    got re-elected. Lucey was the key to the building of the Democratic Party in
                    Wisconsin. He would labor, and it was part of his business background, for hours
                    and days over a mailing and how it would be put together, and where the pitch
                    for funds would come and how it would be phrased. He was a superb fund raiser.
                    He was somewhat more conservative than the governor I worked for; he was a
                    fiscal conservative, whereas the governor I worked for had raised taxes and
                    raised the budget by 25% to finance many needed improvements in state programs
                    and facilities. But he wasn't re-elected, and Lucey was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, was Lucey able to work with the Chamber of
                        Commerce? Was he able to get over that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: They did manage to do a number of things together, but he realized
                    that they were working with him because they had to and he was doing the same.
                    He had good friends within the chamber, although most of them were Republicans.
                    They were an overseas business community which, as you know, where ever you find
                    them, are interested mainly in the security of their firms and their
                    investments. They are far less involved in issues of the American political
                    scene than their American business counterparts would be in the United States.
                    They are part of a different universe, and live very well within Mexican
                    society. But he had a number of strong supporters, and foremost among him was a
                    man who was a leading member of the business community, Victor Agather. He held
                    a big farewell lunch for Lucey at his home, and even if some in the business
                    community resented Lucey's unwillingness to push for tax relief for the wealthy,
                    Agather's standing in the American business community was such that everybody
                    had to attend. He had a huge room in his house in which he could almost hold a
                    ball, and he filled it up with long tables, and every seat was taken. At the end
                    of the meal, he got up and toasted Lucey as the best U.S. ambassador he had ever
                    known, and he had been in that country for a long time. He was not only a
                    successful businessmamaking and distributing Timex wristwatches world-wide - but
                    also a World War II hero who piloted a B-29, one of which he and several friends
                    of his owned and kept in Texas as part of the Confederate Air Force. Every once
                    in awhile they would go up there and fly it, once even flying it up to Oshkosh,
                    Wisconsin to the annual air show. When I was area director for Latin America I
                    visited Mexico and the cultural attach� held a reception in my honor. By that
                    time, Agather was quite ill, had to move about with a respirator and required a
                    nurse in attendance at all times. But he came to the reception, and to a
                    breakfast held the next morning for a group of artist friends of mine. He was a
                    remarkable man, one of a kind, who understood that there were issues more
                    important than the narrow commercial focus of most of his colleagues.</p>
                <p>John Reinhardt was the Director of USIA at the time, and came down to Mexico to
                    represent the President at the opening of the major art show that I spoke of
                    earlier. I was with him on one of his visits to an official we dealt with when I
                    got a phone call in the car from the Ambassador. He said, “You have to come back
                    to the office.” I said, “I'm with John Reinhardt”, and he said “I know, but you
                    have to come back, I'm resigning.” I turned to Reinhardt and told him that I had
                    to return to the embassy because the Ambassador was resigning and he said: “Go
                    do your job. Others will take care of me.” Lucey wanted me to help him with his
                    resignation statement, which made no reference to the fact that he was planning
                    to work for Ted Kennedy, who was going to challenge President Carter's
                    re-election. When he got to Washington he was invited to lunch one on one with
                    Carter, who knew what was up. Carter had told Lucey that he was going to offer
                    him the cabinet-rank position of energy czar whenever Secretary Schlesinger
                    left. Lucey had become greatly involved with energy issues while in Mexico and
                    was on top of most of them, particularly those involving gas and oil. But when
                    Schlesinger left the post Carter named someone else without ever saying a word
                    to Lucey. He told me that at the White House lunch Carter had offered him one of
                    two cabinet positions; I. believe they were HUD and Commerce. Lucey told him
                    that he had already made a commitment to work for Kennedy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Trying to pick this up, Carter bothered a lot of Americans
                        and people involved in the political sphere but also regular Americans by
                        making promises and then not doing it. The most egregious one was forcing
                        the Germans to support the so-called Neutron bomb and then deciding not to
                        do it leaving Helmut Schmidt dangling out there. He was detested for that.
                        Was there a feeling, I mean you are close to sort of the politics, of
                        concern about Carter and how he ran things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: There was disappointment among Democratic elected officials and party
                    workers that Carter appeared to be so vulnerable, that he had not reached out
                    beyond Georgia, beyond the people from Georgia who surrounded him in the White
                    House instead of using his office to establish strong ties across state lines
                    with the Democrats in other regions. John F. Kennedy, I think I mentioned to you
                    once, was as popular among Wisconsin Democrats as he was in Massachusetts. That
                    was true in many other states. Lyndon Johnson had the same problem as Carter,
                    because he was seen as so Texas bound. It was very hard for him to break into
                    and form strong alliances in other parts of the country. With Johnson everything
                    was transactional, whereas with Kennedy it was pure Irish politics. I help you
                    not because I want something in return right now, but because I know that when I
                    need help, you will be there.</p>
                <p>With Kennedy, and then with Johnson, there was a federal judgeship vacant in
                    Madison, and the senators and the governor were all behind a labor lawyer named
                    Dave Rabinowitz from Sheboygan. Rabinowitz had been the lawyer for the United
                    Auto Workers in the bitter Kohler strike that lasted for years, and Kennedy
                    nominated him for the judgeship. He was primarily a bankruptcy lawyer although
                    he handled labor cases as well. Well labor lawyers and bankruptcy lawyers were
                    not the people who ran the American Bar Association. The Wisconsin chapter of
                    the American Bar Association found him only marginally qualified. In a famous
                    statement, after the nomination had not been acted on by the judiciary committee
                    and the question came up at a press conference as to whether Kennedy would
                    re-submit Rabinowitz's name in the next congressional session, Kennedy said:
                    “I'm for Dave.” That is the kind of thing Wisconsin Democrats wanted to hear and
                    just in the spirit that they welcomed. Not long after Kennedy died, Reynolds and
                    Lucey both got phone calls early in the morning, about 6 a.m., from President
                    Johnson wringing his hands. “Oh what should do about this nomination. You know
                    it is really going to cause me problems.” That wasn't the way Kennedy would have
                    done it. It was clear Johnson was setting a price for that nomination that he
                    would collect some day and he wanted Rabinowitz' sponsors to beg for it and know
                    that something would be expected in return. It was the opposite of the way
                    Kennedy had done it. I think that was what weakened Johnson. I think it may not
                    have been the same with Carter, but it was a bloodless kind of relationship with
                    most of the people in the party. It was distant.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>When Carter came to Mexico in early 1978, Lucey went all out for him. This was
                    only shortly after I had gotten there. Carter came down the steps of Air Force
                    One looking terrible. It was the morning that Ambassador Adolph Dubbs had been
                    killed in Afghanistan, and when the U.S. embassy in Iran had been over run for
                    the first time, the first effort to take over. He had been up since 3:00 in the
                    morning. There was talk of canceling the visit, but he thought the meeting was
                    too important to postpone. But when he got off the plane I thought he was
                    terribly sick. He looked awful, and the schedule of course was brutal. It was
                    from the airport to a meeting with President Lopez Portillo to a meeting with
                    the foreign minister, and then there was a formal lunch at the foreign ministry.
                    The issue hanging in the air for the meeting was all about oil, all about
                    energy. A deal had been negotiated in which Lopez Portillo had to face down the
                    left in Mexico who didn't want any kind of agreement with the United States
                    about oil, about selling oil because of the history of American ownership and
                    British ownership of Mexico's oil resources in the 1920's. He faced them down
                    and there was a tentative agreement on the sale of natural gas to start with.
                    Schlesinger became the Secretary of Energy and he rejected the deal because the
                    price was above the world price. Lopez Portillo was known to have said, “The
                    Americans have left me hanging by my paint brush,” the image of a painter
                    painting a ceiling and someone taking away the ladder. So that was in the air.
                    At the end of the dinner, Carter was asked to speak. He made an unscripted,
                    rambling kind of nostalgic memoir about his visit to Mexico as a young man with
                    his wife when he had gotten Montezuma's revenge along with a few other pleasant
                    statements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You better tell what Montezuma's revenge is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Montezuma's revenge was dysentery, said to be inflicted as a payback
                    to those who had conquered Mexico. I was sitting with Mexicans and nobody at the
                    table blinked an eye or snickered or frowned or anything at Carter's reference
                    to Montezuma's revenge, but greeted it with murmured laughter. Lopez Portillo
                    got up and gave an extremely nationalistic response. The key phrase was “We know
                    who our friends really are by the way they treat us.” Every Mexican and all the
                    foreign diplomats knew what that meant. There was an audible gasp from the
                    audience. It was an insult to the American president, and I don't think Jimmy
                    Carter realized it at the time, because I think he was groggy. Afterwards, all
                    the American presat least those who weren't based in Mexico — wrote about the
                    Montezuma's revenge statement as if it were a huge gaffe, and I told them they
                    were missing the story. The next day the Mexican press was full of praise for
                    Lopez Portillo because he had stood up to the American president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Mexican context when you say our friends, how they
                        treat us, what I mean was there something in the air immediately or was it
                        just generic?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: What was in the air was the gas deal. They were just outraged because
                    Lopez Portillo in their view had stuck his neck out in order to make a deal that
                    they saw as mutually beneficial. The delivery of Mexican gas would be good for
                    the United States; the Mexicans were getting a better price than they could get
                    elsewhere, and it would open the door to a more fulsome energy relationship.
                    They were never going to allow ownership of Mexican production facilities, but
                    they certainly were and are a major supplier and a dependable supplier of gas
                    and petroleum products. That's what was in the air, and every Mexican there and
                    most of the Americans in the room outside of the press knew what he was saying.
                    So Carter was not that popular in Mexico, but that was not the reason for
                    Lucey's disaffection. It was really first of all that if Teddy was going to run,
                    Lucey was a Kennedy guy and always would be. He could have been in JFK's cabinet
                    if he wanted it. He knew that and LBJ knew it. It didn't mean he was hostile. He
                    supported Carter when he ran but in a race between a Kennedy and anybody else,
                    he was for the Kennedy, as he was for Bobby Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. How hard was it to work with the Mexicans in setting up
                        the details of the President's visit? Could they get their act
                        together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: We had an embassy team assigned to work with our counterparts on the
                    Mexican side. The key counterpart for such an event was the Estado Mayor —. a
                    professional military household operation at Los Pinos, the Presidential
                    compound, which was extraordinarily effective. The first event was to be the
                    arrival at the airport. You go there and they tell you exactly where the plane
                    will come and exactly where it will stop and where a speech is being made and
                    here were stands for 5,000 people. How many people do you expect in the stands?
                    They said there will be 5,000, and there were 5,000 people, with 50 peso notes
                    in their pockets. Every place you went you would know exactly who would be there
                    and how many and it never failed to work. They were in full control of
                    everything. The Estado Mayor could get anything done it wanted to.</p>
                <p>Once there was a space exhibit to which we had gotten NASA to send some models
                    and posters. The Mexicans wanted the Ambassador to walk through it with
                    President Lopez Portillo. Lucey thought he needed some technical backup if he
                    were going to explain the space program to the President, and we called NASA in
                    Houston and they sent us down an astronaut. He made a great hit. However the day
                    before the exhibit we went to look at the arrangements and nothing was uno
                    stands, no exhibits, no posters, all of which we had supplied. We were
                    astonished because the Estado Mayor had to know that the President would be
                    there, and apparently something had fallen through the cracks. We called the
                    Estado Mayor and told them there would be a very embarrassing situation because
                    it was hard to believe that the exhibit could be mounted overnight. They said:
                    “We have already taken care of that. It will all be up.” The next day it looked
                    like it had been built a week before. Everything was in its place. I learned
                    that if you really needed something done in Mexico, you got it done through the
                    Estado Mayor.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>The visit in Brussels that I had worked on was very different. It was just
                    honorific; there were no big issues. But a presidential visit opens the door for
                    contacts that, if you are able to, you keep and will serve you well all during
                    the rest of your time in the country you're assigned to, and I found that true
                    on Presidential visits elsewhere. I made friends with people in los Pinos, the
                    Mexican White House, who afterwards would come to my house for dinner. A call
                    from the top impresses people and helps move things along, and that's true in
                    many countries, including our own. So despite the mess it made of our program
                    for three or four months, the visit was a helpful experience. But right after
                    the visit the post was inspected, and received a terrible report. The inspection
                    report noted that we lacked program activity, never mentioning that we had been
                    tied up for a full three months in preparations for the President's visit. I
                    responded with a point by point refutation and asked for a new inspection. The
                    Director threw out the inspection report and said you don't need another
                    inspection. It was a hatchet job and even Washington knew it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how about after Lucey went; you say you had almost an
                        interim ambassador didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Not for long. John Ferch was the charge but Bob Dunn called me and
                    said, “What do you think of this? A top guy on the list is Julian Nava. He is an
                    elected member of the Los Angeles board of education, a professor at one of the
                    California state universities. He was an historian. His father, a barber, was
                    born in Zacatecas and left during the Mexican revolution, as did many Mexicans.
                    Nava was a pilot in WWII and then a Ph.D. in history from Harvard.” I said I
                    thought the Mexican press will welcome it. Nava came down and we got on well. He
                    spoke excellent Spanish, and he was liked by some of the Mexican left. He could
                    talk to intellectuals, and did so. But he never really got a good welcome within
                    the Mexican government, the top echelons of government. I think there were
                    racial reasons. He was darker than anyone in the Mexican cabinet. He was truly a
                    son of Mexico. The Mexican cabinet all talked about “Nosotros los Indios,” — We
                    Indians” — but outside of the one or two junior ministers, it was a pretty solid
                    European cabinet. Nava didn't have the kind of political clout that Lucey had
                    because his political experience was purely local. He didn't have that kind of
                    access in Washington that Lucey had and the Mexicans knew it. He was treated
                    poorly for the worst of reasons by the Mexicans. The last time I saw him, he was
                    in Mexico doing some representation for a US manufacturer, and seemed to be in
                    good spirits. I don't think the time in Mexico hurt him. He did, however, make a
                    big mistake when he arrived in Mexico. There was a notorious chief of police in
                    Mexico who had built a mansion in Zihuatanejo and kept a string of polo ponies
                    in Cuernavaca, all on a monthly salary of $400. He was later tried and convicted
                    of any number of things. When Julian Nava came to the airport, he was met there
                    by this Mexican chief of police and rode off with him in his limousine in front
                    of all of us and the press, a terrible mistake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he know, I mean normally the ambassador goes in his
                        own car. I mean it sounds like no one had briefed the ambassador about you
                        know, just the normal entry route.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I don't know. I think that Nava felt that he had better contacts with
                    Mexico than we did, and the devil take the hindmost. You know, in the day to day
                    work in the embassy, he did a fine job. In a larger sense though, I don't think
                    he made use of the opportunities as best he could. At some point he thought he
                    could actually stay on in a Reagan administration, but he didn't. It was again a
                    period when a charge ran the Embassy, and John Ferch had gone on to Cuba as head
                    of our mission there and later became our ambassador in Honduras, and there was
                    a rather long gap before John Gavin, Reagan's appointee as Ambassador, was
                    confirmed and arrived on the job. John Gavin's nomination by the president
                    caused consternation and some disdain in the Mexican press and the public
                    because he was identified as an actor. I think however, once he came down,
                    although he did have some difficulties later on, he did impress a good deal of
                    Mexican society with his superb knowledge of Spanish. His Spanish was
                    impeccable. His mother was born in Mexico, in Sonora. I think I mentioned his
                    mother's family had settled in California before California became a state. He
                    was a cousin of one of the leading writers of Mexico, Carlos Fuentes, who he
                    called Charlie Fountain. They had spent a lot of time together as children.</p>
                <p>He had a tendency shared by almost all politically appointed ambassadors,
                    including Lucey at times, to sometimes speak out on Mexican affairs as if they
                    were presidents of Mexico rather than Ambassadors to the country. It was
                    appropriate to speak publicly about issues relating to our interests, but
                    dangerous to tell Mexicans how to manage their own affairs, at least in
                    public.</p>
                <p>Problems became serious I think, for Gavin, in 1985, after the great earthquake
                    in Mexico City, at a time that I was already in Ottawa. The president was saying
                    that they had lost 10,000 people, and Gavin made a public statement that there
                    were 20.000 or more who had died. He may have been right, but being right was
                    not necessarily the objective of diplomacy. He sometimes felt that you had to
                    talk tough to Mexicans. On such issues as trade, they had a rather closed
                    society. A businessman could for instance, decide that he wanted to make Waring
                    blenders in Mexico, so with a little clout he could get an exclusive license
                    from the US manufacturer, a high tariff from the Mexican government, assemble
                    the parts in Mexico and sell the blenders for three times the price they could
                    be bought in the US. He could then play golf every day because all he had to do
                    was check the office once in awhile to see that everything was going well.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>So dealing with them was hard, and Gavin felt that sometimes you had to deal
                    publicly with them. So did Lucey. But Lucey told me that he was once told by the
                    late Meyer Rosenne, at the time the Israeli ambassador to Mexico, a man who had
                    been a lieutenant general in Israeli security and had served in Mexico for a
                    long time, that his approach to Mexicans was wrong. After a speech that Lucey
                    had given castigating the Mexicans for their restrictiveness in trade and
                    investment, the Israeli ambassador told him: “Pat, you have to understand
                    something. Think of Mexico as an adolescent boy. He is just becoming aware that
                    he is attractive to females. He's got a little money in his pocket for the first
                    time. You come along and tell him he's got pimples on his face and he ought to
                    blow his nose and straighten his hair. The Mexicans will react like that
                    adolescent boy would.” Lucey took it to heart. Gavin on the other hand, felt
                    that Mexicans needed a kick in the butt once in awhile. And I remember that
                    Harry Shlaudeman, who was a career ambassador of great experience, once told me
                    that he thought that Gavin handled the Mexicans exactly as they should be. From
                    our standpoint you know, it didn't make our job easier.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Gavin and I started off on very good terms. I was due to leave at the
                    end of 1982, but after we had worked together for awhile he asked me to stay for
                    a second year. That was helpful to me as well. My wife and I had separated.
                    After a year, she agreed that my two younger children could came back to live
                    with me. I knew that shortly after my next tour they would be going off to
                    college, and I thought they would be unprepared for it, unprepared for living in
                    the States. They had been overseas so much and protected from many things that
                    school kids have to learn to do in the US, so that I wanted to get to a post
                    that had good public schools, reliable public transportation, and a place where
                    they could get jobs after school. The one place I could do that was Canada. A
                    friend of mine was in Canada, and was extending for a year. At first the Agency
                    wanted me to take over the post in Bangkok but I said I would not take two
                    teenagers to Bangkok as a single father. They were very supportive, so I stayed
                    the second year. But during that time, Gavin came to feel that I wasn't being
                    enough of a flack. I worked on his...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is a flack?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: A flack is a personal publicity representative rather than someone
                    with the extensive program we were carrying out. I got a call one day from our
                    area director, Steve Dachi, asking me what had gone wrong with my relations with
                    the ambassador. He said he thought we were on good terms. I said, “I thought so
                    too. He was at my house last night for dinner. Why do you say that?” “Well
                    because he has told Charlie Wick he thinks it is time for a change in the
                    PAO-ship.” I said, “That's fascinating. Are you sure that it is right?” “Oh
                    yeah. Don't worry. We will take care of you. There is a job in Tampa.” It was in
                    an advisory role to the newly established Delta Force for rapid deployment to
                    hot spots. “No,” I said, “I will handle it down here.” I made an appointment to
                    talk to the ambassador and told him that I understood that he had asked the
                    Agency to replace me. He was obviously upset and surprised that I had learned
                    this, and when he asked where this came from I told him something anyone in the
                    government learns fairly soon, that there are few secrets in Washington,
                    particularly when a good job is coming open. He said he was sure there was some
                    misunderstanding, and the issue disappeared, but he did mention that he hoped I
                    could put more staff time into supporting his public appearances, and I assured
                    him we would continue to do all he needed where public affairs were concerned.
                    And that was it. But obviously there had been some damage to our relationship,
                    although we worked the rest of the year together as best we could. Before I left
                    he held a very nice farewell lunch for me with a large turnout of editors and
                    people in education and the arts. He was very courteous, very gracious, and
                    we've spoken since then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what about, one heard about Gavin having problems at
                        the embassy. He changed DCM's a couple of times I have heard, and also he
                        had so called temple dogs which were notorious, personal staff who sort of
                        isolated the ambassador. Could you comment on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well the only real problem was a young man who had been in the Foreign
                    Service and was in Washington at the time that Gavin was awaiting confirmation
                    and was doing the usual reading in and meeting different people in Washington
                    who had an interest in Mexico, and becoming acquainted with the issues. The
                    young man, I think he was a class 6 officer, quite new to the service, was
                    assigned to assist Gavin's preparation for his confirmation hearings. He formed
                    a friendship with him, resigned form the Foreign Service and came back in as
                    special assistant to Gavin at the level of a senior officer, a Class 2, a rank
                    that is now called a Counselor. From a class 6 officer to a counselor is a
                    process that can take up most of a career with about five or six assignments in
                    between. I think there was resentment, more resentment than there would have
                    been had he come in from the outside because he was sharing in matters that were
                    well above what he would have been dealing with had he not run into Gavin in
                    Washington. We had some run-ins. I think a number of people did. I don't know
                    whether it really affected the ambassador's ability to do his job.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>The staff meetings were perhaps a little more restrictive than they might have
                    been. Maybe not everybody talked with as much candor. But I think Gavin did, on
                    the whole, as good a job as was possible under the circumstances. Reagan, of
                    course, was not popular in Mexico. He became more popular later on. He came down
                    to a big show that Lopez Portillo put on when he invited 22 presidents to gather
                    in Cancun. Many of them wouldn't have come until they learned that President
                    Reagan was willing to come down to it. Normally a president wouldn't want to
                    come down if he was only one of 22, but he did. It was a good show of support
                    for Mexico. I think relations warmed after that. But the same issues were there,
                    and still are. I think there was an effort made to systematize the relationship,
                    starting during the Carter administration but carried over into the Reagan
                    administration, to systematize contacts at all levels between Mexico and the
                    United States. We had these annual bilateral meetings which went beyond the
                    foreign ministers. We brought together representatives from top levels of the
                    branches of government that were part of this complicated interface between the
                    two societies and it has helped to make relations flow more smoothly.</p>
                <p>Gavin was a bit put out with the career people during the time I was able to
                    observe him, because I think, he was used to being treated like a star and
                    didn't feel he was getting that treatment in the embassy. I remember that he
                    chewed out my information officer once because, at a speech he was giving before
                    the American Chamber of Commerce, the waiters served coffee while he was still
                    speaking and he could hear the cups rattle. We discussed it afterwards and I
                    asked him to blame me if something goes wrong and not on someone who works for
                    me. I added that if he wants us to handle all of the arrangements for his public
                    appearances, rather than handle it through his special assistant, we'd be happy
                    to do it. But blaming a very experienced officer like my information officer for
                    a waiter serving coffee while he was speaking was something we might not be able
                    to control. He was good about that. But things like that came up now and again.
                    As you know, ambassadors are treated with respect, but people who work for them
                    also think they are professionals, and there was some feeling among some people
                    in the embassy, not all, that Ambassador Gavin expected more than the normal
                    political appointee might. But I am not aware of any real trouble with the
                    Mexican government until that flare up with him in the administration of Miguel
                    de la Madrid, successor to Lopez Portillo. I think his relations with Lopez
                    Portillo were pretty good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, this covers the entire time you were there, have
                        a problem which I am sure will surface when we talk about your time in
                        Canada, but the cultural effect of American media on Mexico? Did that bother
                        the Mexicans?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well Mexicans in the best areas of Mexico City had access to cable
                    television, which brought in American news. It brought in American football
                    which was becoming very popular. The Dallas Cowboys, you would think, were a
                    Mexican team. I guess satellite and cable have become even more extensive now in
                    Mexico. When there was a story in the American press about some failure of
                    Mexican society or Mexican government it would bring a barrage of responses form
                    the Mexican press of all stripes. It didn't matter what the political coloration
                    of the press was, it was energized to defend the flag, and rabid nationalism was
                    just below the surface. But below that surface of instant nationalism or
                    nationalistic response, there was a great regard I think for American society,
                    and a contempt for the inability of the Mexican government to care for the
                    people at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder, who were largely living in
                    Indian communities. In some of those communities the first language wasn't
                    Spanish, but Nahuatl, or one of the other pre-Hispanic languages. Middle class
                    Mexicans, especially during the time when the peso was enormously overvalued —
                    when it was 22 to one before it fell one afternoon to 200 to onwere living very
                    well. If you got on the plane from Mexico City to San Antonio or Houston, there
                    were even farm hands on the flight, who because of the exchange rate could
                    afford to fly up there and buy Christmas gifts and bring them back to Mexico.
                    There was an enormous amount of economic activity between Mexico and the US at
                    that time. Mexicans were buying up Southwest property left and right. In San
                    Diego there were high rise condominiums at Coronado Beach that were being bought
                    by so many Mexicans that they were referred to as “Tortilla Towers” by the
                    native Californians. Everybody was buying a safe haven because of their
                    certainty that the peso would fall, and that it could be accompanied by a
                    political crisis. This fellow who I told you had been deputy director of the
                    Banco Rural owned three houses in San Diego. People were not only traveling to
                    the US, not only watching American television, but were also angling in every
                    way they could to acquire a green card. Everybody wanted the ability to go back
                    and forth across the border freely. Many of the more substantial businessmen got
                    them. They were almost dual citizens, members of both societies. Mexicans told
                    jokes about themselves. They told about the fellow who went up to Tijuana and
                    made his first trip across the border into San Diego. He said, “Oh now I know
                    why America is so rich while we are so poor. You got the paved half.”</p>
                <p>They held a complicated view of America. Octavio Paz, who I met on a number of
                    occasions and who I regarded as the most remarkable Mexican, and perhaps one of
                    the most remarkable men I had ever met, wrote a book, a classic called “The
                    Labyrinth of Solitude”. It attempts to explain the complicated psychological
                    differences between Mexico and almost everyone else, but certainly between
                    Mexicans and North Americans. Mexico he describes as another aspect of Spanish
                    culture, which is another aspect of western culture. The Mexican part of it is
                    the Mestizo, the mixture of the Indian and the Spaniard. Even if it is not a
                    genetic mixture in all circumstances, it becomes a psychological mixture, even
                    among Creoles, Mexican families of pure European descent. And he describes the
                    result as a mask over the face of the Mexican that obscures the real cultural
                    difference between us and them. Americans expect other people to be open because
                    we are so open, whereas Mexicans reveal themselves only gradually and only when
                    it is called for by their own needs.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>This reveals itself in unexpected ways. I remember something that happened on one
                    of the trips we were working on, one of the exchanges with Mexican and American
                    editors. There was a sports writer in the group who we knew well, a convivial
                    man who was very well regarded by the editors who wanted him to work with us on
                    the arrangements. We were meeting to discuss speakers and their subjects and the
                    like, and there was a dinner followed by a series of toasts, all of them the
                    expected gracious complements on how important it was that we were establishing
                    ties across the border and the like. This sports writer gets up and launches
                    into a fiery nationalistic speech about Mexican patrimony and how we welcome
                    American interests but we will always defend Mexico's freedom and integrity
                    against all would be invaders. I thought what the hell was that all about? One
                    of my Mexican friends took me aside and told me it was just like our reciting of
                    the pledge of allegiance, a ritual of no great consequence. I think he was also
                    making sure that the others stayed in line and didn't go overboard in making
                    Americans think that there were no differences between them and us. And yet at
                    the same time there is an enormous, deep familiarity of many Mexicans with
                    American society. I remember when the Seattle Mariners came down to play an
                    exhibition game in the baseball stadium with one of the Mexican league baseball
                    teams. I was asked to throw out the first ball, but I wouldn't agree to do it
                    unless they also let my 9 year old son David throw out a ball as well.. Of
                    course I threw my ball, as most people do when invited to do that ceremonial
                    pitch, into the dirt. My son threw a perfect strike. The fans laughed at me and
                    cheered for him, just as an American crowd in a baseball park would have done.
                    It was a reaction that was common to both societies. I really feel there are no
                    humans on the planet who know how to enjoy themselves more than Mexicans who
                    have some spare money to spend. But our Mexican staff, who earned decent
                    salaries but, with few exceptions, were barely in the middle class, were even
                    more delightful to be with. I think I was closer to them personally than I was
                    to any staff I ever worked with, even before I joined the Foreign Service. They
                    were wonderful, thoughtful, and very warm human beings. We had a great time,
                    great parties; any occasion would trigger one. We would go down to the basement
                    shipping and storage area and see somebody off with carnitos and beer after
                    working hours. It was a great group. Mexicans and Americans, no matter what they
                    say, know how to get along. My closest relationship was with my driver, Salvador
                    Lupercio. He was a sweet, gentle man, with a great sense of humor and a strong
                    dedication to his job. He was eligible for retirement at the time the peso fell,
                    and the longer he stayed on the weaker his pension became. But he refused to
                    leave the job until I left that summer, no matter how hard I urged him to do so.
                    I kept in touch with him for a long time but am afraid he's gone now.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you know, in listening to you, I have a feeling
                        there, I am sure there are more than two, but from the American point of
                        view there are two Mexicos. One is Mexico City, and then there is northern
                        Mexico. I am not talking about those Indian indigenous populations or the
                        southern one. I am just talking about the two areas that affect us. One is
                        Mexico City where power is concentrated, and then northern Mexico where most
                        of the officials and all have got their own ties to California and Arizona
                        and New Mexico, Texas. I mean they are almost running on, I mean did you
                        find that being Mexico-centric that sometimes Northern Mexico was beyond
                        your control or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: All of Mexico was beyond my control, and really beyond US control. We
                    had very good programs going in both Monterrey and Guadalajara, and also had a
                    nice distribution of bi-national centers in a number of cities. I had never
                    worked with bi-national centers before, but they were a tremendous asset, not
                    only as English-teaching centers, but also as cultural programmers and in some
                    cases libraries. They were chartered under Mexican law and were legally Mexican
                    institutions. We helped them and tried to provide cultural programming and
                    assistance as we could, particularly by bringing down experts in teaching
                    English as a second language to help train their teachers. In Monterrey, we had
                    an officer who was spending all of his time messing with the small library,
                    which was housed in the consulate which nobody came to unless they needed a
                    visa.. We just took the whole collection and gave a grant to the bi-national
                    center in Monterrey. They built a wing on to the center and we put a real
                    library in there, and all of a sudden the library was well used.</p>
                <p>Monterrey was vastly different from Mexico City. It always has been. It is a
                    strong Catholic area, whereas Mexico City is still under the spell of the
                    anti-Catholicism of the Mexican revolution. I was told by a left-wing editor
                    that many people think Mexicans are Catholic because they go to church, pin
                    little metal hearts, legs, arms, trucks, cows on a panel displaying the Virgin
                    in hopes of a cure for whatever or whoever is ailing. They also, at the
                    commemoration of the vision by a peasant of the Virgin, will crawl on their
                    knees from Puebla to Mexico City as a way of showing reverence at the Cathedral
                    built in her honor. But my friend said they are not Catholic, they are
                    religious. They pray at churches that were built on the ruins of their old
                    pyramids, and if the churches ever go, he said, they would still pray at those
                    sites. At any rate, no president, at that time, would ever be photographed going
                    to church. Vicente Fox is now in Mexico City and I don't know his practice. The
                    north won that election because more of Mexico became northern-like, became
                    interested in becoming an effective society. There is now a northern style
                    newspaper, La Reforma, in Mexico City that wasn't there when I was there, which
                    more closely displays a journalistic style and lack of front-page editorializing
                    that is uncommon in Mexican journalism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about when you were there? I mean was there a
                        difference in your dealing or our efforts in Monterrey and elsewhere and in
                        Mexico City?</hi>

                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well in Monterrey, we had open access to Monterrey Tech, which was
                    arguably the best university in Mexico. There were very strong, friendly
                    newspapers. And Monterrey was also the best site, at a time when we had no post
                    in Tijuana, to organize programs involving communities on both sides of the
                    border. We had programs between border newspapers and border universities. But
                    after my time in Mexico, when I was area director, a post was established in
                    Tijuana. Now the Mexicans were very aware of the dual nature of that part of
                    their country, so they built a cultural center in Tijuana because it was their
                    view that the northerners didn't realize they were Mexican. They would call a
                    truck, “camion” in Spanish, a “troca”. Their language was being affected by
                    English words, and beyond that, their proximity to American society was making
                    them a different kind of Mexican, lacking the nationalistic fervor of those who
                    lived closer to Mexico City and losing the mentality that saw the United States
                    as a threat to Mexican sovereignty. We couldn't really cover the territory; it
                    was just too huge. At one point we had a post in Hermosillo, where we had a
                    consulate, but we couldn't maintain it. From time to time the PAO from Monterrey
                    would make a visit there. Border towns like Brownsville and Matamoros were also
                    out of reach. We had a good post in Guadalajara which people from Mexico will
                    tell you is the most Mexican place in Mexico If someone in Mexico said he was
                    going to the US but could only visit one city and would want to go to the most
                    American city of all, I'm not sure anyone could honestly designate one. But the
                    state of Jalisco and its capital, Guadalajara, are considered very much the
                    heart and soul of Mexico. Lopez Portillo was from there. His successor was from
                    not far away. We had good programs there, not huge programs but good programs.
                    We identified candidates for Fulbright grants, exchange grants. We had good
                    relationships with the newspapers. We supported the consulate. But the fact of
                    the matter is that while I was there, Mexico City, with its 20 million people,
                    was a combination of New York and Washington, the political, cultural and
                    financial center of the country, and that's where our programs were
                    focused...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the universities in Mexico City? One thinks of

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Luis Echeverria, later President, was minister of the interior when
                    the demonstrations took place. Recently I saw that he was absolved of
                    responsibility for the deaths that occurred when the Army fired on demonstrating
                    students.</p>

                        parts of the world, heavily Marxist faculty and all of that. How did you
                        find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: UNAM, the Autonomous National University of Mexico which, with its
                    preparatory school had over 360,000 students, was very hard for us to bring a
                    speaker to. We had professors who were tops in their fields who their
                    counterparts at UNAM were eager to invite, but were dissuaded because of the
                    prospect of student demonstrations against an “imperialistic agent” coming to
                    the campus. But we had a wonderful library in Mexico City, the Benjamin Franklin
                    Library, which I believe was the first US government library established
                    overseas. It attracted the students from the university, because the collection
                    was good but, more importantly, the shelves were open. They could browse freely
                    in our library and talk with us freely, but it was difficult for us to be on
                    that campus. We could go on many other campuses. Certainly ITAM, the Autonomous
                    Technical Institute of Mexico, was a place where we were welcome. There were
                    several Catholic universities we had good relations with, as well as private
                    institutions and some with government affiliation. In fact we had relations with
                    certain faculty members at UNAM, those who understood that they needed contact
                    with us so that they could give their students the preparation to operate
                    internationally and understand the changes that not only US and Canadian but
                    also European and a number of Asian societies were undergoing.</p>
                <p>There were enough foreign businesses established and growing in Mexico, with
                    Mexican employees and in many cases managers, that a middle class was developing
                    that was free of the cant of not only Marxism but of the revolution. That is the
                    generation that has transformed Mexico into what it is now. It was not as open
                    to us as it might have been, but even in Europe, including Belgium, we had to
                    work carefully so as not to put the people we worked with in a difficult
                    position. We had good relations with people on the left in the universities who
                    were not excessively doctrinaire. Most had several identities. Few could exist
                    on their academic salaries. They would write for the newspapers, sit on boards
                    and commissions and lead issue groups. We could interact in that manner freely,
                    away from the university proper, but it enabled us to talk about the day when we
                    could really do things at UNAM of the kind that we were doing at Monterey Tech,
                    ITAM and elsewhere — bring the kind of American professors down that their
                    counterparts at UNAM would have been delighted to meet and share with their
                    students.. But many on the left changed over the years, as they have in the US.
                    There was a very prominent leftist professor at UNAM, Adolfo Aguilar Zinsser,
                    who was the brother in law of Manuel Becerra Acosta, editor of Unomasuno. He had
                    studied at Harvard and was an outspoken critic of Mexico's energy policy towards
                    the US. Surprisingly, he became a top aide to Vicente Fox when he became
                    president, and eventually became Mexico's ambassador to the United Nations.
                    Tragically, he died in an automobile accident in Mexico in his early 50's. He
                    was a good example of the kind of person who had strongly antipathetic feelings
                    towards the US, who nonetheless enjoyed a good argument over a beer and gave us
                    an insight into what was going on in the university and in the intellectual
                    world of Mexico Dealing with the students was a matter of whether or not we
                    could draw them into functions and into the library which they were free to come
                    to, and many did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a solid exodus of the Mexican children of sort
                        of the ruling class going to American universities and coming back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Very much so, particularly among the wealthier classes. But it was
                    also increasingly the choice of the political classes as well. As I mentioned,
                    the head of the American desk, whose stepfather was on the left of the PRI and
                    became Foreign Minister, went to the University of Pennsylvania. The son of the
                    darling of the left wing, Jesus Reyes Heroles, who was minister of the interior
                    and the left's favorite to succeed Lopez Portillo, received a Fulbright
                    scholarship, studied in the US, and became ambassador to the US. I think Mexico
                    was re-orienting itself. For a long time the Mexican upper classes thought first
                    of Europe when it came to educating their children. Spain, France, to some
                    extent Britain had been the destinations of choice, but an American education
                    had become the most desirable credential for success in the “new Mexico”.</p>
                <p>I did a paper when I was in my last year of the Foreign Service at the Institute
                    for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown, which took a look at the opportunities
                    for study in the United States open at that point to foreign students. And I
                    took a look at the Fulbright program as a fraction of that. It turned out that
                    the Fulbright program, funded mainly by the US government except in countries
                    where there was bilateral financing, accounted for less than 1.5% of foreign
                    students in American universities, which indicated the enormity of the private
                    flow of foreign students to the United States. I argued that since our program
                    was so comparatively small in proportion to the total flow of students, it
                    should re-adopt the reason stated by the original proposal by Senator Fulbright
                    for its enactment: to work for better international understanding and world
                    peace. This would mean adopting a broader view than the Fulbright Board favored,
                    of selecting only the very top scholars no matter what their fields, but also
                    looking for ways to address the needs of universities in places that the eminent
                    scholars didn't want to go to. The example I used was the request from the
                    Jesuit Central American University in El Salvador, which had suffered the
                    assassination of a number of its priests during the civil war, for a professor
                    of journalism. At the time, El Salvador was still dangerous, but we found a
                    young assistant professor of journalism who was willing to go there, and he made
                    a difference greater than a lofty scholar who might have been willing to stay
                    for a week rather than a year could possibly have done. He helped to reestablish
                    relations between the US and the University, where it was assumed that the
                    killings could not have taken place without US acquiescence. The presence of
                    foreign students here was not only a great cultural advantage, both for the
                    foreign students and the American students who studied with them, but an
                    enormous source of income for the US. I pointed this out on many occasions to
                    the people who were talking about the fear of having 30,000 Chinese students in
                    the United States. But those first 30,000 students, most of whom already have
                    returned to China, seem to be having an effect on Chinese society, from what I
                    heard on a recent trip to China. Their American experience has given them new
                    aspirations.</p>

                        when we are inhibiting this because of security.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes, we are losing our greatest advantage in the ideas market. I was
                    going to mention one other thing when we were talking about issues. There was
                    one issue I had some flak on from Washington because of a decision we made when
                    formulating the country plan. Drugs were a problem then as they are now in
                    Mexico, but the Mexicans were most worried about marijuana because their kids
                    were using it, and less worried about the cocaine and about poppies. We had very
                    quietly gotten an agreement with the Mexican government in which we gave them
                    planes and worked together so we would identify targets for their planes to
                    spread crop destroying chemicals. I think it was a very quiet agreement that
                    never appeared in the Mexican press, and the level of binational cooperation on
                    drugs was never discussed lest it stir nationalistic protests. We were under
                    pressure from Washington to have a major drug information program, but we
                    thought better of it, that public information at that time on that issue would
                    make it more difficult for Mexicans to maintain the kind of cooperation they
                    were giving us. Because there was so much conflict in so many other areas, we
                    thought that if this was working, we should leave well enough alone; leave it up
                    to the Mexicans to educate their kids not to use drugs. That was the principal
                    thrust of USIS anti-drug operations, to try to build resistance within that
                    society to the use of drugs by their own kids, which was an inevitable
                    by-product once they started producing them, as happened in Brazil. There we got
                    governors' wives organized in each state's anti drug campaigns. But we didn't do
                    it in Mexico. Later on, as things really became bad, I am sure that the post had
                    to start waging the kind of anti drug campaign that we waged elsewhere, but
                    hopefully with the cooperation of the Mexican authorities.</p>
                <p>Our country plan raised eyebrows on another matter, because along with dealing
                    with immigration, trade, economic and political relations, we also identified a
                    program activity that others thought too broad, too much of an amorphous
                    catch-all. But we defended it because we thought it was at the heart of our
                    contentious relationship with Mexico, and that was mutual misconceptions about
                    each others' society, history, and motives. There were things which happened in
                    America which were read by Mexicans in a way totally different than how we read
                    it, and the same was true as to how we read Mexican events. We felt that the way
                    to deal with that was in creating programs that were fully bi-national in
                    conception, participation and execution. In other words we wouldn't just program
                    to Mexicans, but would act as intermediaries in bringing Mexicans and Americans
                    together, as we did with the press, as we were beginning to do with university
                    groups. These were seminars in which ideas were exchanged between groups, rather
                    than us lecturing to a passive audience. That is what we worked on more
                    assiduously than anything else — to try to figure out a means of communicating
                    in such a way that people felt they were on equal footing, that we were
                    listening as well as talking.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give an example perhaps of during the time you
                        were there of sort of mutual misperceptions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The most obvious one from the uninformed US side was the perception of
                    Mexicans as a nation of Indian peasants controlled by a veneer of transplanted
                    Europeans, peasants who were largely unsophisticated, uneducated, and violent.
                    From our vantage point, we were witnessing a rapid expansion of the Mexican
                    middle class, the beginnings of a political upheaval that would throw off the
                    one-party monopoly of power held by the PRI, and an economic growth stimulated
                    by an expansion in education and newly discovered oil reserves. From the Mexican
                    side, there was a grudging admiration for our political system, economic prowess
                    and perceived efficiency, but a resentment that our liberal democratic ideals
                    were for internal use only, and didn't extend to our dealings with Mexicans and
                    other developing countries. Furthermore, there was a tendency to see nefarious
                    motives in anything we did in dealing with them. If we gave them the benefit of
                    higher prices by selling oil and gas to us because of reduced delivery costs,
                    they thought it was a scheme to control their resources. When Secretary of
                    Energy Schlesinger reneged on the gas agreement because it was well above world
                    prices, we were attempting to undermine Mexico's economy. Also, we were stealing
                    their manpower by luring Mexicans to work on our farms and in our factories by
                    paying them higher wages than they could earn at home, but treating them as
                    slave labor. When floods destroyed homes and farms in Tijuana, a friendly
                    governor had to decline our offer to supply tents to house the displaced because
                    it would be seen as interfering in Mexican internal affairs. The list is
                    long.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A couple of things just before we finish. Cuba. Did Cuba
                        come up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes. Cuba was a constant issue. When Fidel Castro and Che Guevara had
                    to leave Cuba after the aborted first attempted revolutionary attack, they came
                    to Mexico on a little boat call Granma. I was told by the director of Televisa,
                    the privately owned, staunchly independent and conservative television network,
                    that Guevara and Castro had appeared in one of their novellas as doctors in
                    white coats. He told me that if he had known that was going to happen, “I would
                    have hired them and made them stars to keep them from getting back to Cuba.”
                    There was a great feeling of camaraderie between Cuba and Mexico, certainly in
                    the left wing of the PRI. It was part of a way of putting a stick in Uncle Sam's
                    eye, but it was also part of the way that the oligarchy that controlled the PRI
                    and reaped the benefits thereof could demonstrate at very low cost, without
                    giving up their mansions, chauffeured cars and casas chicas, their love nests,
                    that in their heart of hearts, they too were revolutionaries. They certainly
                    were not going to upsetting the apple cart within Mexico, but had to bow to the
                    widespread public approval of Castro, not because of what he was doing in Cuba,
                    but because of how he had stood up to the colossus of the north. These days,
                    however, relations between Mexico and Cuba are not as close as they once
                    were.</p>

                        Canada. I mean just again the designated whipping boy or something like

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I take great pleasure in pointing that out to people who say, “What
                    are you doing in Canada for God's sake? They're just like us!” I point out to
                    them that anti- Americanism was invented by the New England colonists who
                    opposed the revolution and fled to Canada when independence became a fact.
                    Because on a superficial level we see very little difference between ourselves
                    and our cousins to the Great White North, we overlook the often subtle
                    differences that make Canadian society somewhat different than our own. They
                    pride themselves on having less violence, greater egalitarianism, and nicer
                    cities in many cases. But many of the most talented of them seek their fortune
                    in the US, in the media, in our universities, in our businesses. In many ways,
                    the US plays the same role vis a vis Canada as France plays vis a vis Belgium.
                    Ambitious Canadians know that the gold ring is on the US merry go round.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well finally before we leave Mexico, there are two issues.
                        One, how about corruption? You know I think of the dinosaurs of the PRI, and
                        you mentioned the chief of police at $400 a month and living very well thank
                        you and salting away his polo stables and all that. Did corruption play a
                        part in what you were doing or did you have to work around it to get stories
                        in? Anyway how about the whole corruption picture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: That never arose when it came to our dealings with the press. We never
                    paid to place a story. But corruption existed at every level of Mexican society.
                    You could be driving late at night and a policeman stops you and says, “You went
                    through that light.' You say, “What light? There is no light here.” Well you can
                    pay 200 pesos there or they take you down to the station and it is 1000 pesos.
                    “I am a diplomat. You can see it on my license.” “Yes well we can straighten it
                    out down there. You are tired. You give me 200 pesos and you can go home.” I had
                    some wealthy friends who owned some land on which they got a permit to build a
                    luxury apartment house. It was designed to contain 16 apartments. They
                    determined that they miscalculated, that in order to make money on the project
                    they would have to have 20 apartments, and add two stories. So they went to
                    negotiate this with the official in charge of such things in the Mexico City
                    bureaucracy. They worked it out. “How did you work it out?” They said, “He gets
                    one apartment. We get three, we can make it.” I said, “Well doesn't that drive
                    you crazy?” He said, “Look you have to understand Mexico. None of these people
                    get paid very much. Every Mexican official has to raise his own taxes. He is the
                    one who is responsible for bringing the income in that he lives on. It is
                    unfortunate but it is a part of life.”</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>People in Mexico accept it, the mordida, the bite. He doesn't have to ask for it
                    but you make it available. In a sense his view becomes your view. You are asking
                    me to give you something that will enrich you. Why should I? The law doesn't
                    require me to do this. You are asking for an exception to the rule. What do you
                    expect me to do? What would induce me to do such a thing? You know what it is;
                    he doesn't have to say it. So you have to come prepared to say the right thing
                    at the right time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stan, one last question on this unless you have something
                        else you want to add. You were there when the Reagan administration came in.
                        How, did you have a problem dealing with Reagan at first? You know here is a
                        movie actor. I think all over the world I think we had a problem of somebody
                        who is coming from the political field and had the reputation of being far
                        right, in presenting him, and also the impact of Charlie Wick.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I didn't have any problems other than those I mentioned when the
                    initial Mexican reaction to Reagan, in the press anyway, was that he was an
                    actor and therefore unqualified to be president. They forgot about his being a
                    governor of a state with a GNP much larger than their own. But I think the
                    Mexican government obviously treated him with respect no matter what they may
                    have said privately to each other. We didn't have a problem with Reagan; we had
                    a problem with his staff at one point. When Reagan was going to come down to
                    Cancun to attend a meeting of 22 presidents that the Mexican president had
                    arranged, I was awaiting an invitation from the White House advance team to work
                    with them on press facilities and other things that we would normally be
                    involved in when a President visits. Instead the advance team, the pre advance
                    team, seized on a long-time Embassy staffer who was sort of a meeter and greeter
                    for the embassy who had insinuated himself into the confidence of these young
                    and idealistic people. Finally we began to have contacts with the White House
                    press people, but there were still meetings on subjects that we'd have to be
                    responsible for in which we were left out. Finally I talked to Ambassador Gavin
                    during the meeting in Cancun. There was a mid-day break and he and I went for a
                    swim, and I told him I was having a hard time dealing with the White House
                    people, and wondered if he knew what the problem was. He said “Well let me ask
                    you a couple of questions. Did you ever have Julian Nava stay at your house
                    after he came back to visit?” I told him that Lucey had stayed at my house, but
                    Nava had not.” Gavin said he knew that Lucey and I were friends, but they were
                    concerned about Nava. He asked if I had written speeches for Nava that he had
                    used in campaigning in the US for Carter during the election, and I said,
                    truthfully, that I hadn't and that he had never asked me to. He acknowledged
                    that those issues were the source of the problem, and that he would straighten
                    things out. After that it became much better.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the problem in Central America, I am speaking of the

                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes. We had organized demonstrations in front of the embassy on many
                    occasions. Young people in designer jeans would parade denouncing our activities
                    in El Salvador, and Nicaragua. Central America was close to Mexico, but when I
                    got to know Central America more when I was traveling as area director, nothing
                    frightened Central Americans more then their proximity to Mexico.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Colossus to the north, right. It never got out of hand, never got
                    violent. I don't remember us ever having a rock thrown at the Benjamin Franklin
                    Library or people not coming to English language classes at the Mexican American
                    Institute. The demonstrations were pro forma, but we took them seriously for
                    security reasons.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes, but the greater focus at that point was Salvador. I am trying to
                    remember the exact sequence of these conflicts, but clearly Salvador was the
                    focus because it was the bloodiest at the time. The official line, the official
                    position of the Mexican government, was that we were mishandling the situation.
                    They weren't supporting the leftist regimes, but they felt there were other
                    means to ameliorate the situation. The real problem was hunger. The real problem
                    was the rigid class system, the oligarchy, which in the case of Mexico was the
                    pot calling the kettle black. But it did not, and this was the important key
                    point, it did not take precedence over the real issues that Mexico was concerned
                    with in its bilateral relationship with us. Those were the economic and
                    immigration and energy issues that were at the heart of their well being.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, well I think, Stan this is a good place to

                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I wanted to respond to your request that I think about any specific
                    examples of the aberrations in the Mexican press. I spoke to a good friend who
                    was our information officer, who came down to Mexico with me, Larry Ikels. We
                    compared notes last night, and we agreed that it wasn't so much any specific
                    zaniness on any particular story. It was an overall atmosphere of paranoia which
                    colored almost everything that appeared in the Mexican press vis a vis the
                    bilateral relationship, because Mexicans are raised with their mother's milk,
                    and certainly in their school system, to regard the United States as a threat to
                    their sovereignty. One could argue they had reason to do so following the loss
                    of much of what is now the American southwest to the United States after the war
                    of 1848. But it was that paranoiac reaction that saw every gesture, every
                    initiative of the United States vis a vis Mexico, as having a hidden agenda
                    which was to compromise Mexican sovereignty and control of its energy,
                    especially during the time I was there. There are a couple of incidents that
                    Larry reminded me of that we were involved in, that didn't specifically relate
                    only to the press but beyond it. But they do serve to illustrate the point.</p>
                <p>One of them turned out to be an incident that probably was in my own memory the
                    most shameful act I ever committed on behalf of public diplomacy. Mstislav
                    Rostropovich was the conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra. They came
                    down to Mexico to perform at the Cervantino festival in the lovely old Spanish
                    mining town of Guanajuato. At the end of the concert he came out to conduct an
                    encore. He conducted the Stars and Stripes Forever, and there was an uproar in
                    the audience, with loud shouts of “down with American imperialism,” because they
                    saw that patriotic American march as a hostile gesture. When Rostropovich came
                    down with the orchestra to Mexico City to perform, he held a press conference a
                    day before the concert and responded to questions from the press as to his
                    choice of an American march that had inflamed his audience in Guanajuato. He
                    told them that Sousa was to the march what Strauss was to the waltz, the best
                    example of its genre, and he thought that settled the matter.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Lucey had a small dinner in his honor that night, and we talked about
                    the uproar at the concert in Guanajuato. I asked him what his encore would be at
                    the concert in Mexico City. He said, “Well, we are playing the Pathetique
                    symphony of Tchaikovsky, which ends on a religious note and usually isn't
                    followed by an encore. But if one is demanded, we would probably play the march
                    from The Love for Three Oranges by Prokofiev. That, I suppose would be
                    acceptable for a Mexican audience.” I said “Yes, of course,” ... and this is
                    something I rue saying to this very day, “but it's possible however, that the
                    Mexican press would feel they taught you a lesson in Guanajuato.” And raising
                    his eyebrows he said, “Oh?” The next night the concert was held and received
                    tumultuous applause. He came out to do an encore and he conducted the Prokofiev
                    march as he had indicated he would. Great applause followed, and he came out
                    again and went right into a vigorous performance of the Stars and Stripes
                    Forever. Half of the audience was on its feet shouting, “Viva Mexico.” The other
                    half was applauding. Of course the newspapers went wild with it. I think he was
                    delighted, but I don't think it was my job as a public affairs officer to induce
                    a hostile reaction in a Mexican audience, even though it was not at the expense
                    of the maestro who, as I say, thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>The other incident reflects upon the political venom which many Mexican
                    columnists spewed when we undertook a program that was popular among most
                    Mexicans. As I mentioned earlier, at the time of the Carter visit, the wife of
                    President Lopez PortillCarmen Romano de Lopez Portillo — wanted a large American
                    art exhibit as a cultural highlight of the president's visit. I think I
                    mentioned that we told her it was something that we would be glad to entertain
                    for the future, but we only had a few months before the president's visit, and
                    something like that takes a long time and a lot of preparation. After the visit
                    was over, she didn't let us forget about it. So we entered into negotiations.
                    The Mexicans cooperated and assumed a very generous portion of the financial
                    responsibility for an exhibit which was curated by a distinguished professor of
                    art history from the City University of New York, Milton Brown. He accepted the
                    assignment on the condition that the five great museums of Washington would
                    contribute works to this exhibit, and would not in any way bar him from taking
                    any works he wanted from their walls. He took 90 works starting with Copley and
                    ending with Diebenkorn, spanning almost the entire history of American art.</p>
                <p>It was a great success. Almost 200,000 Mexicans came to see it in the two months
                    it was up. Excelsior, which was at that time the leading newspaper in Mexico and
                    very nationalistic, chose to pick a violent critic of the United States to
                    review the exhibit. He lashed out at it for what it did not contain, meaning a
                    series of artists who should have been there if we had taken Mexico seriously.
                    And to our delight, every artist he named was in fact part of the exhibit. We
                    called on Milton Brown, who turned out to be an excellent polemicist, to
                    respond, and he made Excelsior's critic look like a fool. But that is an example
                    of how, even in the cultural field, a Mexican newspaper, a leading one, would
                    reach out to find someone who would find a political basis for criticism of the
                    exhibit. It was one of the things that made me conclude that art is politics in
                    Mexico as it is no where else, with the possible exception of France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you went up to Canada where there is absolutely
                        no paranoia concerning the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: That is not true. I specialized in paranoid countries.</p>

                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well you see, it is the birthplace of anti-Americanism. The United
                    Empire Loyalists went there at the end of the revolution when they were the
                    first non-French speaking white settlers allowed to settle in Ontario. To this
                    day you go to the York club in Ontario, and you have to toast the queen before
                    cigarette smoking is allowed both before and after dinner. I think that still
                    exists. It certainly was true when I was there. I went to Canada for very
                    specific personal reasons. I was at the time a single parent. My kids were of
                    high school age, and this probably would be the last post when I had any
                    supervision over them before they went off to college. I wanted to take them to
                    a post where they could learn to live in a world different from the world of
                    young children in a diplomatic setting, which meant they would have to learn to
                    use public transportation, go to a public high school, and get jobs after
                    school. The only place I could do that was in Canada. It was coming open a year
                    after I was due to leave Mexico, but I stayed an extra year, despite my
                    disagreements with Ambassador Gavin, which we worked out, in order to be in line
                    for that posting. We spent three very interesting and very cold years in Ottawa.
                    My kids achieved everything I hoped for and went off to college far better able
                    to cope with the real world. And I also persuaded Adriana Bianchi, an Argentine
                    scholar with a US education who I met when she was teaching at a university in
                    Mexico, to join us in Canada where we were married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I was there from 1983 to 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I was the counselor for public affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador, and how did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well he was a very interesting and colorful man. His name was Paul
                    Robinson. He was the president of an international insurance company that his
                    father had founded in Chicago, and was the chief Illinois fund raiser for the
                    Reagan campaign in Illinois. He had made many waves in Canada by making it his
                    personal task to travel the country berating the Canadians for not pulling their
                    weight in meeting the common defense obligation, that their spending on military
                    hardware and on mutual defense was disproportionate to their GDP, the lowest
                    proportion in NATO. He trotted out many figures to describe the disparity
                    between NATO's defense posture and that of the Soviet Union and its Eastern
                    European allies at that time. But every time he gave a speech the figures tended
                    to change, to the delight of our critics. My first task was to find some way,
                    because he was a very determined man and was not easy to contradict, to get him
                    to use accurate numbers and stick to them.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>I had, when I was in Mexico, very good relations with what we then had — a world
                    class printing plant that served all of Latin America and much of other parts of
                    the world. Our two major printing plants were in Mexico and the Philippines, and
                    the magnificent book of 90 full color reproductions of the works in our Mexican
                    exhibit were all printed in collaboration between those two printing plants. I
                    called the people at the plant in Mexico and asked if they could produce a
                    pamphlet which would contain the Ambassador's basic speech, with his photo, and
                    get it to us very rapidly. They said they would do it in record time. So I went
                    to Ambassador Robinson and told him that his basic speech was important enough
                    to warrant a mailing to universities, defense institutions, periodicals and
                    newspapers, but since he didn't use a text, it would be useful if he would
                    dictate the speech to his secretary. He thought that was a great idea, and did
                    it right away.</p>
                <p>We then gave the text to the Embassy's defense attach� and asked him to get every
                    one at the Defense Department whose armaments were mentioned to vet the numbers
                    and make sure they were accurate and up to date. We sent the corrected material
                    to Mexico and I believe it came back in a fine little pamphlet with the
                    Ambassador's photo on the cover within a week or ten days. From that time on he
                    stuck by that text, with the correct figures that we could defend against
                    critics. And from that day on we were on fine terms.</p>
                <p>He was a great baseball fan, a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan with a box seat for all
                    their games at Wrigley Field. The manager and a few stars of the Toronto Blue
                    Jays would annually come to Ottawa as guests at a dinner that was held in a
                    beautiful hall in the majestic Canadian parliament building to discuss the
                    outlook for the team in the coming year and answer questions. A collection of
                    the leading lights of Canadian politics were invited to the dinner, and the
                    Ambassador, knowing that I grew up in Brooklyn and was a Dodger fan, invited me
                    to join him at the dinner since his wife was not a baseball fan. There were four
                    large round tables, with about 10 people at each. The majority leader of the
                    Canadian senate was the host at our table, and before dinner and the session
                    with the Blues Jays, called on each of us to tell his favorite baseball story.
                    It started with the Ambassador, went around the table, and ended with me. I had
                    only one story to tell, and while others were telling theirs I wondered whether
                    it would be acceptable to tell it in that august company.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: There is a rather strong word in it, without which it makes no sense,
                    but since this was hopefully among friends, I took the risk of telling it... I
                    told about having gone to see the Brooklyn Dodgers with some friends of mine
                    when we were about 12 or 13 years old at Ebbets Field, a night game. There was
                    pitcher called Hugh Casey who was a real roughneck. He once reportedly had a
                    fight in a saloon with Ernest Hemingway when the Dodgers trained in Cuba. He was
                    a heavy drinker and was one of the early relief specialists in the major
                    leagues. That night the Dodgers were getting beat up, and he came in to relieve,
                    in the fifth inning as I recall. He pitched the rest of the game, getting in and
                    out of trouble, but won it. It was a marvelous performance from a guy who was
                    out of condition and getting by on sheer guile. We waited at the players exit to
                    get his autograph, and finally he came out dressed like an insurance salesman,
                    snap brim hat, brown pinstripe suit. Now we were only interested in his
                    autograph. We congratulated him on his performance, and offered him our pads and
                    pens. He said, “Not now kids, I am really a little tired.” So we followed him
                    down the street, and just before the elevated subway station he stopped to get
                    the News and the Mirror, which came out late in the evening, and to get a shoe
                    shine. While he was getting his shoes shined we asked, “Can we get your
                    autograph now?” “Let me rest a little kids. Let me just read the paper,” Well he
                    tips the shoe shine boy, goes up the stairs of the elevated and goes through the
                    gate leading to Manhattan. Our route was to go the other way, back to Coney
                    Island, change subway trains and go up to Bay Parkway. Instead we followed him
                    on the train to Manhattan, standing by as he read his paper, repeating our
                    request. He said, “Not now kids, just let me read a little more.”</p>
                <p>Before we knew it we were at Union Square, 14th Street in Manhattan. He gets up
                    to leave the train. We follow him off the train pleading. “Mr. Casey, we have
                    done everything you said. We are in trouble now. We should have been home a long
                    time ago.” (This was long before cell phones.) He went through the turnstile and
                    I called out to him. “Mr. Casey, if we go through this turnstile it is going to
                    cost us another nickel to get back on the subway. Why don't you just show us
                    some kindness and give us the autograph. We followed you all this way.” He
                    stopped, and he turned around and came back to the turnstile, and we extended
                    our pads and pens certain that he wasn't going to walk off and disappoint us.
                    When he reached us he stopped and said, “F..k you, kids,” and he turned and
                    walked away. I have used that story to describe to people in various cities what
                    could be in store for them if they really want major league baseball players in
                    town as a constructive influence on their kids.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>Well those at the table, to my relief, roared with laughter, especially Paul
                    Robinson. We got on even better after that evening. The next morning I found a
                    copy of the new annual baseball almanac on my desk. Inside the cover page it was
                    signed: “Good Luck Kid. Hugh Casey.” I knew it came from the Ambassador and we
                    had a good laugh about it. I'll never forget that, when he left the
                    Ambassadorship after the election to go back to Chicago, he threw a huge dinner
                    for the wealthiest people in Ottawa at which he charged an attendance fee of
                    $500 a head, all of which went to the Kidney Foundation. (His mother's life was
                    saved by the donation of a kidney from his sister.) It was hugely attended. He
                    had gotten the best hotels into putting up tents and serving their favorite
                    desserts, and it went on and on until one or two a.m. and there were about 12 or
                    14 of his closest friends and a couple of us embassy types left. I would not
                    attempt to reproduce his articulation at the end of such a long and wet evening,
                    but as I remember he said to the groggy assemblage, throwing his arm around me:
                    “I never would have guessed that when I left Ottawa, my best friend would be a
                    New York liberal Jew.”</p>
                <p>I have seen him since, both in Washington and Chicago and we always exchange
                    Christmas cards. He was such a baseball fan that he put up a pitching machine
                    and a backstop on the front lawn of the ambassador's residence, and made me get
                    up to hit soon after I got there. I had played some baseball as a kid and I hit
                    the first pitch from the machine, a line drive. He said, “I've finally got a PAO
                    who can hit. A slash hitter.” He promised to reward anybody who could hit the
                    ball far enough to break a window in the residence, but the lawn was huge and
                    thankfully nobody did it. Everybody sort of laughed about his miniature baseball
                    field until one day Pierre Trudeau, then prime minister of Canada, stopped by
                    with his three sons to have a go at the pitching machine. He was colorful, and I
                    think that despite the fact that he was a target for lampooning in the press,
                    they knew that he was a man who had a good sense of humor, loved Canada deeply,
                    and I think that in the long run, because Canada did increase its defense
                    budget, he had a useful effect on Canadian defense policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This concentration on the defense thing, was there some
                        guidance from the State Department or was this his thing, or did people in
                        Washington tell you to cool it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well I think there was consternation on the Canada desk over the
                    stridency of his message, but he was regarded as a powerful political appointee.
                    It certainly was not a contradiction to the President's own message, and
                    whatever the concerns were, he did as he chose in this matter. He was not off
                    line on the message. He was just not a traditional State Department type. But
                    that is true I think in the case of many political ambassadors who choose to be
                    proactive in public affairs. I am not at all convinced that it is a bad thing.
                    It is very rare for most career ambassadors to call attention to themselves by
                    haranguing the host country on an issue of mutual concern. But sometimes a
                    political ambassador who comes there for a short time can get away with
                    something that needs saying. Any foreign ministry can observe that, well he is
                    not really a career diplomat, is he? But they hear the message. In the case of
                    the political ambassadors for whom I have worked, they had an advantage in being
                    able to make phone calls that most career ambassadors can not, to people in
                    Congress and the Senate and the White House, whereas most career ambassadors
                    have to wade through State Department channels.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, well, a little bit of compare and
                        contrast between the environment in your job in Mexico and Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The issues were in some cases similar, but the context and the style
                    were very different. The Canadians were every bit as hostile as the Mexicans to
                    our involvement with the contras in Nicaragua and the right wing government in
                    El Salvador. And when we brought the son of Violetta Chamorro, who later became
                    president of Nicaragua, to speak in Ottawa, there were those who thought we were
                    out of line. The son was the editor of the only remaining independent and
                    outspoken newspaper, La Prensa. His father, the editor, had been killed. The son
                    was a very bright guy, educated in the US and we had his appearance sponsored by
                    the International Press Association representative in Ottawa, who was editor of
                    the major Ottawa newspaper.</p>
                <p>Chamorro gave, I thought, a very realistic assessment of where the Sandinistas
                    were headed and what the opposition was like, discounting the contras, and what
                    was happening to them. When it was found out that we had paid his expenses,
                    somehow the Ottawa papers made that the story. Even if we asked how else he
                    could get there, since there was no money in Nicaragua for people who are not in
                    the government to come up there, they played it as if we had used subterfuge. It
                    seemed silly and somewhat amateurish in our eyes to characterize is as
                    underhanded. Later on when the strategic defense initiative became a high
                    administration priority, and we were told to flog it, we had speakers coming up
                    who were greeted with total derision. It was not an issue for Mexicans to be
                    concerned about because they had no direct involvement in the strategic defense
                    of North America. But the Canadians did, and they thought, as many Americans
                    did, that the concept was eyewash</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>Canadians loved to feel that they had built a society that was free of the
                    violence and poverty that existed in the US, and that they had a better life.
                    And yet, when you take a look at the number of Canadians who have come here to
                    make their name, they are everywhere. They are everywhere in the arts, the
                    sciences, the universities, and the media. During the Vietnam War there were a
                    large number of Americans of draft age who had come to Canada because of their
                    opposition to the war or, in some cases, just to avoid the draft. A number of
                    them ended up teaching in Canadian universities, and became some of the harshest
                    critics of American policy in Canada. But those issues were conducted and talked
                    about in perhaps a less paranoid manner than was the case of Mexico, mostly
                    because there was vastly more interchange between the two societies. That was
                    not only on the level of the academies and the newspapers and business, but in
                    government.</p>
                <p>In the embassy in Mexico, at the time I was there at least, there was very little
                    direct interchange between Mexican government officials and their counterparts
                    in the US government. In Canada, however, our environmental people and their
                    environmental people would talk directly. Our commercial people and their
                    commercial people, our treasury people and their treasury people had direct
                    lines to each other's offices. They knew each other. They traveled back and
                    forth. So the differences are subtle, but real. The Canadians are determined not
                    to become a mirror of American society, although that varies depending on where
                    you go in Canada. Canadians in Ontario and Manitoba fear that someday they will
                    lose Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia to the United States because the
                    Canadians there are so much more pro American, feel so much that their lives and
                    concerns are very much like those of Americans. In Manitoba, Ontario, and then
                    certainly Quebec, attitudes are far more nationalistic, although Quebecers
                    sometimes seem to feel more comfortable with Americans than with their
                    English-speaking Canadian countrymen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you go to Nova Scotia where Boston is their
                        capital.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: That's right. And Quebec is a very complicated issue because it's
                    Canada's great divide. But the Quebecers use that. They like to feel closer to
                    us than they do to Canadians, the Quebec nationalists anyway, than they do to
                    English speaking Canadians. They had a consulate in Boston of about 34 people,
                    which was extraordinary. They were very active in developing business ties,
                    particularly in energy. They sell a lot of power to the United States from their
                    vast hydro electric resources. But the recurring efforts of Quebec nationalists
                    to gain autonomy was an issue that we obviously stayed strictly out of, because
                    it is for Canadians to decide. We would gain nothing by entering into it,
                    although obviously we don't relish the idea of Canada splitting. The pressure
                    within Canada waxes and wanes. Right now it is in a waning period. I think
                    certainly every American administration would prefer a united Canada, although
                    when you get out to the West of Canada many people say “let them go and be done
                    with it.” I doubt that it's going to happen. At least I hope it won't.</p>

                        Montreal and Quebec and Toronto. Were you having a problem of keeping the
                        Quebec nationalists from snuggling too close to us and trying to co-opt
                        us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: We had offices in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, consisting of one
                    American plus a Canadian staff and a library. Those programs were very active
                    because they were in great cities. The major universities of the country were in
                    those places. Carleton University and Ottawa University had some decent
                    departments, but the strongest centers of higher education were elsewhere. You
                    had McGill in Montreal plus several French-speaking universities. The PAO in
                    Montreal was also responsible for Quebec City which was the site of Laval
                    University. Toronto of course had the University of Toronto, which is the great
                    university of Canada, but also York University and in Lower Ontario some very
                    good universities, Kingston, Queens College, the University of Western Ontario
                    and a university in Waterloo that was probably the best center for computer
                    science in the country. In Vancouver, the University of British Columbia was
                    outstanding, and there was a first rate university in Winnipeg, the University
                    of Manitoba. There were also consulates in Calgary and in Winnipeg. We tried to
                    serve them by sending materials for one of the State Department local staff to
                    distribute. Canada is a vast country but it is not very deep. About 80% of the
                    population lives within 150 miles of the U.S. border. So you can't cover the
                    whole country, but we really seldom try to cover any country geographically. We
                    try to find the people who shape attitudes in the country and the institutions
                    to which they belong. We tried to form cooperative relationships with those
                    people, the gate keepers, to reach the country as best we can.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well talk about Quebec. I somehow have this feeling that
                        Quebec in a way parallels France in that they have their intellectuals at
                        the university and all. Were these important people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes, but there is a very important distinction to be made here. The
                    French in France don't accept the Quebecers in the way the Quebecers would like
                    them to. Their accent is very different; it's still rooted in 17th century
                    French. The Quebecers are North Americans, but they love their French roots;
                    they love their language. Their differences with English speaking Canadians are
                    not merely linguistic, but really involve a matter that may be more serious,
                    since it represents a question of economic and class distinctions. Ottawa
                    adjoins the province of Quebec, separated only by the Ottawa River. Just across
                    the river is the town of Hull. When we were moving in to our house in Ottawa,
                    all the workmen, all the delivery men who would come to our house were French
                    speakers. During the heyday of Anglo ascendancy in Montreal, there were clubs
                    which would not accept French Canadians as members. There was a class
                    distinction which is much stronger I think, ultimately, than the language
                    distinction. But still the same, the movement for independence has given rise to
                    much greater sensitivity within Canada and the realization that if they want to
                    remain united, they would have to address the language issue and the class issue
                    as well. It is a healthy country. They have really good, strong partisan
                    battles, and the strength of their several political parties wax and wane as
                    ours do not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When they lost, the party almost disappeared.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes, the Progressive Conservatives almost disappeared and really have
                    not recovered from their high water mark in the 1980's. They were the dominant
                    party while I was there and then a couple of years later they had only a handful
                    of members of parliament. So there are much stronger swings of fortune there
                    than here. There was a strong third party in Canada, the New Democratic Party
                    which is pretty much a socialist party. One major difference between us is that
                    Canada has a parliamentary system, which produces a very different style of
                    politics than we practice in the US.</p>
                <p>Here, the most useful attribute in Congress is the ability to rise to a committee
                    chairmanship. That is achieved by longevity and developing strong alliances that
                    may not be visible to observers. The accumulation of debts owed by those whose
                    careers you have advanced can be collected once you advance to more important
                    committee chairs. All of this gives you power to get your legislation passed,
                    and to control the agenda of an important area of congressional action, from
                    defense to finance to public works, to health and labor.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>In Canada, the give and take of parliamentary debate values the legislator who is
                    fast on his feet and shines in the quick response that brings hurrahs from his
                    fellow partisans and also brings him attention in the press and on television.
                    American congressional leaders must be powerful. Canadian parliamentary leaders
                    must be brilliant. And they are the product of an enviable educational system. I
                    was friendly with a professor who lived in Ottawa but was born in a tiny town in
                    the north of Saskatchewan, I think it was Ruppert. His father came from Russia
                    as an indentured servant, a Jew who spoke only Yiddish and an Indian dialect
                    that he learned in Saskatchewan. And he worked his way out of that, but the son,
                    because of a Canadian policy of trying to ensure equal education throughout the
                    nation by paying more to young teachers who would go to very distant, rural
                    areas, got a good enough education in that tiny town to be accepted at the
                    University of Saskatchewan. His education there was good enough to get him
                    accepted into the PhD program in economics at the University of Chicago. It is
                    possible that a story like that can occur in the United States, but only in the
                    case of an exceptional teacher who spots an exceptional student. Canadian
                    schools, and the entire educational system, are not tied to local property taxes
                    as ours are. Good schools don't exist because they are located in wealthy areas.
                    The money is spread around to all, and it results in an educational system that
                    is far more uniform across the country than is our own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now did you find that you were keying programs to the
                        English speaking and then to the French speaking. Did you have different
                        focuses or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Not really. We had good relations with the University of Ottawa which
                    was French speaking and more left than Carlton University. In Montreal we dealt
                    with McGill which was English, and with Concordia which was French. But if it
                    was a common venue, we invited people equally. We did start a Fulbright exchange
                    program, which really didn't exist in Canada because everybody thought we didn't
                    need one. We did it in a different form though, and this was with the
                    international relations department of Carlton University. We worked out an
                    agreement whereby professors from the School of Advanced International Studies
                    of Johns Hopkins in Washington would come up and teach a several day course in
                    their specialty at Carlton University, and Carlton University professors would
                    go down to the School of Advanced International Studies to lecture in their
                    specialties in Canadian affairs. It was the only way you could do it with
                    Canada; it had to be two way. It served a very good purpose. Canadian studies in
                    the US are not what they might be. It is a rather rarefied field for a small
                    number of students and scholars but it does exist.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>The North American Free Trade Agreement created new interest in the relationship
                    once it was more than a bilateral free trade agreement with Mexico only. Then
                    the complications that followed out of an attempt to design an agreement which
                    would benefit all three countries took very extended negotiations which
                    concluded long after I left. It created more controversy in the US than in the
                    other two nations, even though Canadians undoubtedly lost some jobs to the US,
                    but there was a fear in the US that jobs in the trans-national auto industry
                    would move to Canada. The tri-lateral negotiation was an undertaking that I
                    couldn't believe, at the time I was in Mexico, was ever possible, as I mentioned
                    earlier. I think it was because we weren't as fully aware as we might have been
                    of the growing power of the new Mexican middle class, people who were
                    professionals or white collar workers who no longer felt they needed political
                    tutelage. This is ultimately what brought about the political change in Mexico
                    that made NAFTA possible.</p>
                <p>In Canada, there was already an enormous amount of American manufacturing and
                    there was significant Canadian-owned manufacturing in America, as well as
                    significant cross border investment in each other's industries-. So in a sense
                    it was easier. But reading Mexico into all of that was a great achievement,
                    because of the significant cultural differences and production processes. I am
                    not an economist, but I salute the negotiators who were able bring it off, and
                    the political skills it took to not only negotiate it but also to have it
                    accepted by a majority of the political actors in all three countries.</p>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well it was certainly there. The Canadians at the time still had
                    restrictions requiring movie theaters to have X percent of Canadian productions
                    on their screens. There was a fuss about American books overwhelming the
                    Canadian products on the shelves of their book stores and libraries. But I think
                    that is changing. You know I make films now, and I get a little check each year
                    from the Canadian consortium that protects American film makers by tabulating
                    the amount of American programs seen on Canadian television and send us a our
                    pro rata share of the royalties owed by Canadian cable systems. I think what is
                    happening is that Canada is now producing some first rate films that are seen in
                    the United States. They have extraordinarily good writers. Margaret Atwood and
                    Robertson Davies are probably read by as many Americans or more than Canadians
                    who are reading American authors. Stephen King might be an exception along with
                    more literary writers like E.L. Doctorow, Phillip Roth, Joyce Carol Oates, or
                    John Updike, But at that same time there is a sensitivity on the part of most
                    countries who feel that their own cultural achievements are being neglected by
                    those of countries like the US, France and the UK whose international media
                    dominate much of the planet. Hollywood is probably the bete noir of foreign
                    cultural commentators because its output dominates local productions simply by
                    the unmatched production values of its films, even if they are artistically
                    inferior to many of the superb small foreign films that serious film fans in the
                    US enjoy. American films are hugely popular in every country I've worked in,
                    including Canada, where our common language and cultural affinity makes them
                    more accessible. But I can't imagine that that will remain a serious issue
                    forever because of the growing strength of Canadian culture and Canadian
                    identity. They are proud of their distinctions and are gaining in
                    self-confidence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get called in, I mean is this an issue had this
                        become an issue while you were there on any particular thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: When we would have meetings on cultural issues we would bring up the
                    Canadian content issue and point out that it was unbecoming a nation that was
                    justifiably proud of its writers, artists and film makers. They would
                    acknowledge that we brought it up and move on, sort of the same reaction that
                    Mexicans have when we point out the distortions in their textbooks. It was a
                    political issue because most Canadian film makers would probably find it more
                    difficult to have some of their films shown without the cultural protection
                    laws. And yet they could point to figures that showed that American films were
                    easily within reach to most Canadians, which was certainly true in all of the
                    video stores and on television. Canadian channels and Canadian cable services
                    carried American television coming from the cities across the border closest to
                    them. So it is really a hopeless task to seal the border off from cultural flows
                    each way. And it is inevitable that the cultural flow would be greater flowing
                    north than flowing south, except for the fact that proportionate to their size,
                    I think Canada is holding its own.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Cuba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Cuba was a freebie for Canadians. Canadians love to be friendly with
                    countries with warm climates. Even working class Canadian families spend a
                    couple of weeks as far south as their budget will allow. If you go down to Miami
                    in the winter you will hear a French Canadian station that operates only in the
                    tourist season. Canadians discovered that travel to Cuba was cheap and fun and
                    then the hotels began improving as foreign investment went in. So although their
                    differences with us over how Castro should be handled were not very different
                    from the way Americans who disagreed with American policy would describe it;
                    nonetheless, it was one of those areas where they were free to tweak us, free to
                    pull Uncle Sam's beard without any consequences. We understood that. There were
                    problems of course, once you start trying to export to the United States
                    Canadian products containing sugar that was bought in Cuba, that ran afoul of
                    American laws restricting Cuban goods. I don't know how they could determine
                    which box of cookies had Cuban sugar in it rather than beet sugar from wherever.
                    It is pretty silly, you know, when you get right down to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, say, the Canadian media? Did you go to
                        the Globe and Mail or any newspaper and you know, say could you get a little
                        more even sided coverage in this issue or that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes, but that wasn't usually the way we would do it. We would, if
                    somebody was in town, a lecturer, a government official who could state our
                    case, we would make them available for an interview. I mean we would not lecture
                    the Globe and Mail, which is a great and responsible newspaper. They had a first
                    rate correspondent in Ottawa, a columnist who we were very close to. He agreed
                    with us on some things and not on others. But you earn a good relationship with
                    newsmen by doing certain things that allow them to develop trust in what you
                    tell them.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>We had several high level visits while I was there. George H.W. Bush came to
                    Canada when he was vice-president and enjoyed a very successful visit. Then
                    later there was what was called the Shamrock Summit between Brian Mulroney, who
                    was prime minister, and President Reagan. It was held in Quebec City which I got
                    to know very well by running back and forth a dozen times before the visit.
                    Before a presidential visit the Washington press corps scheduled to accompany
                    the visit was given a special briefing on the issues. The briefing was to be
                    given by Richard Burt, the then Assistant Secretary for European affairs before
                    Canada became part of a new bureau called Western Hemisphere Affairs. The
                    briefing was to be given in Washington, and we arranged with the White House for
                    a hookup to be set up at the National Press Building in Ottawa, where most
                    newspapers and broadcast media had their offices, and where we had ours. There
                    was a nice studio downstairs and we were able to get a video and sound feed
                    directly into it. The Canadian press came out en masse — about 100 people were
                    there. We had an agreement that, at a certain time in the briefing, Secretary
                    Burt would accept questions from the Canadian press. As far as I know, it was a
                    first, and I'm sure it has now been done wherever facilities are available; at
                    least I hope it's done, because it's important that we treat the press of a host
                    country where the president travels as professionals deserving equal treatment
                    with our own press. There's always a desire by the White House press office to
                    take care of the US press first for obvious reasons, but we got much better
                    treatment for the president than I recall from visits I worked on where the
                    foreign press was clearly given second-class consideration.</p>
                <p>Once we got a satellite dish and USIA started WorldNet, we would invite a half
                    dozen or so Canadian reporters to our office to participate with press in
                    several other countries in interviewing important US officials. Once Secretary
                    of State Shultz participated in such an interview, as did a number of other
                    cabinet members, and the press was very enthusiastic about the program. The
                    interview subject couldn't see them, but he heard their questions and answered
                    them directly. It gave the press in the participating countries the opportunity
                    to ask questions relevant to their own bilateral issues and not only those
                    important only to the US agenda, and created a lot of good will along with many
                    useful stories. Virtually every post now has access to this kind of activity,
                    and I understand there is now new technology that permits programs that are
                    directed at single countries, even smaller posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you get this “poor little us” stuff? You ignore
                        us and all that. I got a little taste of this from this program we have
                        here, this oral history program. Oh about six or seven years ago, in our
                        collection we have taken excerpts from interviews dealing with various
                        countries and lumped them together you know, for the help of someone. One
                        day one of the Canadian correspondents, I think a major one from the Globe
                        and Mail ran across ours at Georgetown University. The next thing we knew,
                        there were front page, “American diplomats expose all. Feel that Canadians
                        suffer from an inferiority complex.” I think one of the people was Paul
                        Robinson who mentioned he carried a gun with him in his car.</hi>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I was not aware of that.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is after. This was a time when I think we had some
                        stuff going on. But I mean you know it was front page stuff when it came.
                        Then of course, another Canadian man in Washington was beaten so he went and
                        called some more on it. It is the only time our embassy wrote and said,
                        “What the hell is this program.” It is the only time we ever had this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well every country in the world is sensitive to how they are dealt
                    with in the United States, and particularly in public. I know that Canada is a
                    great country, but in baseball terms it's Triple A. They feel a bit neglected
                    because of being so close to a giant and seemingly, in the eyes of others in the
                    world, so close culturally. People talk about North America and they mean Canada
                    and the United States and they make no distinction between us. When you live
                    there as an American, you realize the differences are quite real, and yet we are
                    probably more alike than any other two countries. Americans are more like
                    Canadians and Canadians are more like Americans than either of us is like any
                    other people. That is a fact of life, and most Canadians understand that, and
                    most deal with it. You know, Canadians have a great sense of humor. They kid
                    themselves. They kid themselves vis a vis the United States as well. I am
                    neglecting here also to mention that Paul Robinson was not the only ambassador I
                    had served with there. Tom Niles was a career officer, came to Ottawa about
                    midway during my three years there, and we had a very different embassy when he
                    ran it. He was a very professional diplomat, a very serious man, and got along
                    very well in Canada and was respected. He didn't make, and didn't seek to make,
                    the kind of public splash that Paul Robinson did. I wasn't there when he left,
                    and I'm sure he left great admiration behind him, as did Ambassador Robinson,
                    even on the part of many people who disagreed with his politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find while you were there, was the
                        Reagan-Mulroney friendship, two big Irishmen a factor in your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Oh sure. As I mentioned, they called that summit the Shamrock Summit
                    because of the Irish antecedents of the two principals. Reagan was not uniformly
                    popular throughout Canada. He certainly was as popular among conservatives in
                    Canada as he was among conservatives in the United States. But the strategic
                    defense initiative was particularly problematic, as was the fear among many
                    liberals and socialists that he was taking too aggressive a stance in our
                    dealings with the Soviet bloc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Known as Star Wars.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Star Wars was simply not taken seriously in Canada. Nonetheless,
                    despite strong political and attitudinal differences, nobody really hated Ronald
                    Reagan. He didn't stir up the personal hostility that there was in the case of
                    Richard Nixon or these days in the case of George Bush. There were strong
                    differences over issues, but it was a time of reasonably good relations. You
                    know, there have been periods in American-Canadian relations, I guess especially
                    during WWII, where there were some very sharp elbows on both sides, particularly
                    because Canadians entered the war several years before we did. Now there were
                    some issues that are sort of bedrock in the case of Canada and the case of
                    Mexico. In the case of Mexico it is immigration, where they know they are wrong
                    but they need it. They need the money that flows in from migrants and they need
                    the relief of population pressure among young people for whom there are no jobs.
                    In Canada, it's largely economic; it could be fisheries on the west coast and
                    east coasts — the salmon fisheries in the west and the cod fisheries in the
                    east. And then there is always litigation about some economic disagreement or
                    another. Most recently it was the legitimacy of stumpage fees we'd levy on
                    Canadian logs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: A friend of mine has. He is retired and still working on the salmon,

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes. Adriana and I were married in Canada about a year after I
                    arrived.. After I went to Canada with my children, who were 16 and 13 at the
                    time, she came up to visit and scout employment opportunities and found a job
                    teaching and doing research. She wanted to get married in a town with a nice
                    name, and we found a small town 130 miles straight north of Ottawa with the
                    lovely name of Mont Laurier. We drove up there and noticed the trees getting
                    smaller and smaller the further we went. We had discovered a wonderful little
                    Belgian restaurant up there, and after being married at the City Hall, had a
                    lunch for a small group including Ambassador and Mrs. Robinson, my children of
                    course, my sister and her husband from Dallas, a very bright young member of my
                    staff, a Canadian couple who became our best friends, and the Ambassador's
                    chauffer. That was on October 20, 1984, and we had arranged for the restaurant,
                    which was opened that day only for our party, to have a roaring fireplace going,
                    since that late in October in northern Quebec could be extremely cold. As it
                    turned out, it was probably the hottest October 20 in northern Quebec's history.
                    We all took off our jackets but were still sweating. But the meal was wonderful,
                    and then we went back to the Ambassador's home where the rest of the embassy
                    staff had been invited by him and his wife to a reception in our honor.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: We were great importers of Canadian oil from the oil patch. There the
                    Athabasca oil fields produced an oil derived from tar that was more expensive to
                    mine and refine than crude oil at the time, but is far more competitive at
                    today's oil prices. They have a goal of producing up to three million barrels a
                    day by 2015. We also get a sizeable amount of electricity from Quebec's
                    hydroelectric plants, and I believe there have been other sources of oil found
                    in Alberta and other western provinces.</p>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I believe the only issue that arose, and I don't think it was much of
                    an issue while I was there, was the trade in cigarettes. There is a tribe that

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes, and they can sell duty free, tax free cigarettes. All borders
                    create issues. But no, that was very much a Canadian issue. They dealt with it
                    with a soft touch and I don't remember it being of any great moment. My one
                    great regret dealing with the question of Canadian native Indians, or Inuit, was
                    that the Canadians never followed through on a proposed tour for information
                    people from foreign embassies to the far north, as they had arranged for
                    ambassadors at one time. I thought I had my counterpart in the Canadian Ministry
                    of External Affairs convinced he should really take some information officers
                    from different embassies on such a trip. He thought that was a great idea, but
                    it didn't happen. I was counting on that, even though when I retired I did on my
                    own get to Antarctica, but I was really hoping I could get to the Canadian
                    Arctic. There is a wonderful trip I never had the time to make on a train that
                    runs from Winnipeg up to Churchill where, if you get up there at the right time,
                    you can watch the polar bears come in to feed on people's garbage cans.</p>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: There might have been an issue in the Pacific northwest because of the
                    scuffle over timber imports, but it just wasn't the same situation that we faced
                    on the border between the United States and Mexico, where you had a situation
                    like El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, where there are three times as many people in
                    Juarez as there are in El Paso. Both cities are drawing from the same aquifer,
                    and we are using two or three times as much water as the Mexicans are. Or the
                    situation between San Diego and Tijuana with the waste water from the Tijuana
                    River polluting Imperial Beach south of San Diego. You don't have that kind of
                    friction between publics on either side of the US-Canadian border born of issues
                    that really divide them. There aren't that many twin cities as such. People from
                    Manitoba tend to think of Minneapolis as their shopping destination, just as
                    people from Ottawa went to shop in small towns in upstate New York. Even with
                    the Canadian dollar weaker than ours at that time, prices were better in the
                    U.S.</p>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: There is no dependency for jobs the way there was along the Mexican

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well we had an interesting coincidence that then Canadian foreign
                    minister Allan MacEachen and George Shultz were classmates at Stanford.
                    MacEachen was from Halifax, and so he insisted on meeting every three months,
                    which was an impossible schedule to maintain. But they met several times a year,
                    and they met a number of times in Halifax. Halifax is a wonderful town, and I
                    enjoyed going there, but we met in other places too, I remember meetings in
                    Calgary and Toronto. They were not meetings designed to try to settle a specific
                    issue, but rather to try to keep current the management of the relationship, and
                    they were largely successful.</p>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: To Brazil, as minister counselor for public affairs. That was a stark
                    contrast to both Mexico and Canada. We were sent to Brasilia, a new capital born
                    of the desire of President Kubitschek of Brazil to move the country, whose
                    population was concentrated on its Atlantic coast, inland to a plateau 3000 feet
                    above sea level, a vast plain of red clay and brush. When I looked at a map I
                    could see that if you pushed Africa and Latin America together, that Lubumbashi
                    in the Congo and its laterite soil was practically the same laterite I saw 25
                    years later in Brasilia, and they were virtually at the same latitude. It was
                    remote, somewhat more quiet than we preferred, but increasingly livable,
                    particularly after I had been in Brazil awhile. We had at the time seven USIS
                    posts in Brazil. The headquarters was, of course, at the embassy in Brasilia,
                    with large posts in Rio De Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and smaller posts in Belo
                    Horizonte and Porto Alegre in the south and Bahia and Recife in the north. We
                    also had a widespread system of bi-national centers, one as far north as Manaus
                    that was created and run by a wonderful man with great enthusiasm for the United
                    States, and it was a great excuse to get up to Manaus, visit him and his board,
                    leave some books or other gifts, and make sure they knew we appreciated what
                    they were doing. There were, after all, almost a million people living in that
                    city on the Amazon, which was a free port.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't they have an opera house and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: They had an opera house that was built during the great rubber boom of
                    the 19th century. It was under repair when I was there. The New York
                    Philharmonic came down with Zubin Mehta. He wanted to play in Manaus, but we had
                    to tell him it was still under repair, but he still went up there to take a look
                    at it because it is a wonderful little theater, similar to the one built during
                    the silver boom in Mexico in Guanajuato.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The ambassador was one of the great career ambassadors of our time,
                    Harry Shlaudeman. He is a very quiet man, reserved, somewhat shy, but probably
                    the most utterly professional diplomat I have ever known. He arrived there just
                    shortly before I did. He had been the Assistant Secretary for Latin America,
                    ambassador to Argentina, Peru, Venezuela, deputy chief of mission in Chile,
                    served several tours in Colombia as a young officer, and before he came to
                    Brazil was special negotiator for Central America during the problems in
                    Nicaragua. After his retirement the first President Bush, who later gave him the
                    Medal of Freedom, talked him into going to Nicaragua as ambassador. Other than a
                    tour in Bulgaria, he served his entire career in Latin American affairs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been in some very difficult posts.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Oh yes, and he had been negotiator for Central American affairs,
                    largely dealing with the Sandinistas. He was a great golfer and if he resented
                    anything viscerally about the Sandinistas when he was in Managua it's that they
                    had torn up the only golf course in town and made it into a tank training
                    ground. I met him in Washington when I was told of my assignment and he wanted
                    to know my background, where I was from. I told him Wisconsin and of my
                    political work there. He rubbed his head and said, “My God, the people's
                    republic of Wisconsin.” The first few months I was there, he would hold staff
                    meetings and go around the table and ask questions and nod his head and walk
                    out. I felt very distant. I didn't know if he was at all interested in what we
                    were doing. One day that first Christmas, between Christmas and New Years, I was
                    for some reason working. I got a phone call, picked it up and it was Ambassador
                    Shlaudeman on the line. He said, “What are you doing?” I said, “Well I am
                    pretending to work.” He said, “Want to play golf?” I said, “When?” He said,
                    “Now.” And we left the embassy and went to the golf course, and had a wonderful
                    time. I think it was just his way of communicating to me that things were OK. We
                    became quite close. We still correspond by internet. He is living in
                    California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what were the issues that particularly concerned you
                        in Brazil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: The issues that seemed most central to the relationship were economic
                    ones. The Brazilian economy itself was strong but the country was in a constant
                    state of financial crisis. While I was there, there was a terrible period in
                    which price controls were imposed and food disappeared from the markets. My wife
                    had to go out with a friend to a farm and, under the light of a bare bulb in a
                    back room, this farmer cut meat for us that he wouldn't sell in town. The
                    Europeans sent meat that was deep frozen as an emergency supply. The Brazilian
                    press called it “carne mumificada” mummified meat. It was truly inedible. The US
                    was seeking to help out in stabilizing things and of course the IMF took the
                    lead, but it was a very difficult time for Brazilians to get through this. There
                    were also trade issues of enormous importance involving agricultural products,
                    and Brazilian manufactures. Our markets were not as open to the Brazilians as
                    they would have liked, and they were effectively barring us from entering into
                    their computer market. As a consequence, Brazilians had to do with computers of
                    local manufacture and design which were not suited to the very advanced state of
                    most Brazilian manufacturing corporations.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>The contrast between Brazil and Mexico was very great. Brazil represents
                    two-thirds of the South American economy. The State of Sao Paulo at the time,
                    maybe it is even greater now, had a GDP greater than that of Argentina. One of
                    the reasons for the striking nature of Brazil's economic advancement is that,
                    unlike Mexico, it has always welcomed immigrants. As in our own experience, they
                    have attracted ambitious and entrepreneurial people from Italy, Germany, Japan,
                    Russia, Poland, Syria, Lebanon, and Jews from all parts of the world, along of
                    course with the original Portuguese and the only people who came without wanting
                    to, the Africans who were enslaved until 1888, largely from Angola and other
                    West African areas. The largest expatriate Japanese community in the world is
                    found in the state and city of Sao Paulo. They number more than a million.</p>
                <p>In Mexico, it is not impossible to settle as an expatriate, but difficult to
                    become a citizen. I think only the refugees from the Spanish civil war were
                    fully welcomed, as were a number of Jewish refugees from Hitler. The resulting
                    difference is that, although autos are manufactured in Mexico, they are assembly
                    plants of foreign auto makerGeneral Motors and Volkswagen and the like. The
                    Brazilians, I believe, do more of the manufacturing of parts and participate in
                    the design of cars. They also manufacture airplanes that are used by US and
                    European airlines, particularly planes made by Embraer. They are also large arms
                    manufacturers, who had been selling tanks and heavy weapons in the middle east,
                    particularly to Iraq. The two best hospitals in the country are in Sao Paulo.
                    One is the Einstein Hospital, one is the Syrian-Lebanese Hospital. I think this
                    openness to immigration has given it a very different texture than Mexico. It
                    has some world class newspapers and very good television. Mexico has a powerful
                    networTelevisbut is surpassed by Globo, the Brazilian network that is probably
                    the most successful in the developing world. It produced novellausually erotic
                    soap operathat are seen around the world in translation. Among the leading
                    newspapers are the Jornal do Brasil in Rio, the Gazeta Mercantil in Sao Paulo
                    (the Wall Street Journal of Brazil) as well as the Estado do Sao Paulo, Folha
                    and several others. And the fourth largest news weekly in the world is Veja,
                    produced by Editora Abril, the largest publishing house in Latin America, that
                    prints more than 100 magazines. These are serious publications, producing good
                    and usually responsible journalism. On economic issues however, as is the case
                    with newspapers in most countries, even our own, they tend to take the side of
                    their own country when there is a conflict on trade matters. The newspapers in
                    Brasilia itself were particularly egregious, but everybody in government read
                    the papers out of Sao Paulo and Rio.</p>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: We had to be in Brasilia because the Brazilian government was there,
                    which meant our embassy was there. But since the major media and cultural
                    institutions were in Rio and Sao Paulo, I traveled there rather frequently, and
                    tried to make visits to the other posts a couple of times every year. We had
                    good staff at all of our posts. We had three Americans plus a large local staff
                    in both Rio and Sao Paulo, including a book translation operation in Rio. We had
                    good communications within Brazil by telephone, but the people who made a
                    difference in the arts, the universities and the media were not in Brasilia.
                    There were great universities in both Rio and Sao Paulo. There was a university
                    of modest stature in Brasilia, the University of Brasilia, but the University of
                    Sao Paulo was a great institution, as was the University of Campinas in the
                    interior of the State of Sao Paulo. There were both church and public
                    universities in Rio, good universities in Porto Alegre and elsewhere. Porto
                    Alegre was full of surprises, with people in industry very interested in the
                    arts and very strong media. I developed good relations with people in those
                    cities. We opened up a new bi-national center in Recife while I was there that
                    is still going, replacing one having been run by someone who disgraced us. It
                    was not as much fun or as easy to operate from Brasilia as it would have been
                    from either of the other two main cities, but we had close contact with our
                    posts and the program was well coordinated. Today we have posts only in
                    Brasilia, Rio and Sao Paulo. We have shrunk that much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the Universities. Did Brazilian universities
                        follow the same pattern as so many other Latin American ones where there is
                        very strong leftist Marxist anti-American student body. I mean it is almost
                        dangerous to go into there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: No. I mean certainly undergraduates, certainly in Latin America but
                    even in America, you will find tend to have political views that are rather more
                    to the left than in the general population. But I can't think of a university
                    campus in which we couldn't speak to people and carry out programs anywhere in
                    the country. It is just a different atmosphere than in many Latin American
                    countries. We don't own any land that was once part of Brazil. There are
                    certainly differences over policy issues, and Brazilians are temperamentally
                    quite different from us. They are culturally a distinct and voluptuous people,
                    and yet they like many of the same things we like, such as American style
                    shopping centers and most American products. We were of course criticized from
                    the left. The designer of Brasilia, Lucio Costa, and the architect of its
                    buildings, Oscar Niemeyer, were men of the left. Niemeyer was in fact a
                    communist, and the city was laid out by city planners who had in mind very
                    strict rules about how things would be organized. But from a sterile plot of
                    land on an arid plain in the middle of nowhere, it has now really blossomed,
                    because Brazilians will recreate the life style they love no matter where they
                    are. The restaurants are getting much better. Outside of the Plano Piloto, the
                    central plan of the capital, cities have grown up made up of people from the
                    northeast who originally worked on the city who chose not to go home. Satellite
                    cities like Taguatinga and Ceilandia and other towns appeared so that there is a
                    large population on that high plateau now, well over two million people. They
                    grow three crops of soybeans a year on that land; having been made fertile by
                    the development of nutrients to enrich the clay and sand soil, and the climate
                    is very congenial. They are vast exporters of agricultural goodsoybeans and
                    elsewhere oranges and of course coffeall of which, except for coffecompetes with
                    our produce very effectively.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: You have heard the song, “They Grow an Awful Lot of Coffee in Brazil,”
                    they grow an awful lot of everything in Brazil, wonderful fruits, oranges. They
                    make up the major imported source of oranges for the prepared orange juice we
                    drink. It is a country of enormous diversity. They think of themselves as a
                    future major power, and with a population of about 175 million or so, with vast
                    resources, much of it unexplored, and a very productive population, there is no
                    reason why they shouldn't be world class. Now when Charles de Gaulle visited
                    Brazil, he was said to have observed, “Ces't ne pas une pais serieux.” —it is
                    not a serious country. And I suppose by some standards that might seem true.
                    Brazilians love to play so hard that they are not as productive as they
                    otherwise might be, but that is not true of the places where things are really
                    happening. It may be true in smaller cities that are right on the beaclike Bahia
                    or Fortaleza, and it's probably harder to work hard in Rio than it is in Sao
                    Paulo. But they produce an enormous percentage of the shoes we wear in the State
                    of Sao Paulo, and the traffic jams in the city of Sao Paulo occur not because
                    people are playing hard but because they're working hard, and the same is true
                    in Porto Alegre and Belo Horizonte. That is also true in cities most Americans
                    have never heard of with more than a million people, like Curitiba. But they
                    still find time to enjoy life,</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well there is a tremendous influx of migration of rural people into
                    the cities where the jobs are, where the wealth is. And as is the case in many
                    Latin American countries, a lot of protection is given to squatters. If you
                    leave your house unoccupied, and someone else moves in, it is not as easy to get
                    them out as it might be in our country, but that isn't what they were doing.
                    They have been squatting on empty land. There has been a vast movement of
                    landless peasants into the Amazon, into Amazonia, which is a vast region which
                    includes land that is not jungle, but is part of what is known as Amazonia. That
                    has given rise to a major issue between us on environmental concerns. It arose
                    not out of encouragement by the USG to limit deforestation in the fragile
                    Amazonian rainforest, but by statements by celebrities such as the British rock
                    artist Sting and, more importantly, by a delegation of US Senators led by former
                    Sen. Tim Wirth and including heavyweights like Al Gore and the late Senator
                    Heinz. They visited the rainforest and made strong statements asserting that
                    Brazil was putting the planet at risk by allowing the Amazon to be
                    destroyed.</p>
                <p>It was one of the few episodes in which I thought the Brazilian press and
                    government began to act in a manner that one would have expected in Mexico, with
                    an explosion of vituperation for our interference in their affairs. They pointed
                    to our own denuding of forestland in our early history in order to develop our
                    country, and our arrogance in declaring that Brazil had no right to develop its
                    own. There was in fact a very inefficient use of the rainforest arising out of
                    clear cutting land that could then be used to raise cattle. But once you cut
                    down the native vegetation, the land becomes less fertile because the nutrients
                    in the soil are leached out by the heavy rainfall. Then the cattle farmers just
                    move on to new forest areas and cut them down. There is an experimental station
                    I visited with USIA Director Catto run by the Smithsonian that demonstrates the
                    inability of forests newly exposed by the clear cutting of neighboring trees
                    that makes it more difficult for them to survive the exposure to the elements..
                    We did point out to the press that there were more trees today from New York
                    City to the Canadian border than there were in the 19th century, because most of
                    those small farms had disappeared and the forests were allowed to recover.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>We also did something that was possibly the most successful event of its kind
                    that I had experienced in my public diplomacy career. We had formed a very
                    strong friendship with a number of media associations, including the Brazilian
                    associations of magazine publishers, of newspapers, of television and radio, and
                    of journalism education. My closest ally was a man named Roberto Civita, who was
                    president of the largest publishing house in South America, Editora Abril, which
                    published more than a hundred magazines, the most important of which was Veja,
                    the world's fourth largest news magazine. Ambassador Shlaudeman had given a very
                    good speech which got wide attention, describing our own environmental movement,
                    how it started and where it led, starting with Teddy Roosevelt who started with
                    conservation, Rachel Carson who wrote her seminal book Silent Spring, and ending
                    up with the present focus on ecology and the attempt to undo the damage done to
                    our environment.</p>
                <p>Then we held in Rio de Janeiro a seminar attended by 150 science writers from all
                    over Brazil, and co-sponsored the event with the International Association of
                    Science Writers, which was headed by an American at the Smithsonian Observatory
                    in Boston. We got the UN development program to pay for two Asian science
                    writers who wrote on ecological problems in the Philippines and Indonesia, and
                    we brought in several American writers and a couple of U.S. based European
                    science journalists working on the environment. The whole purpose of it was to
                    demonstrate to the Brazilian press what the press was doing elsewhere in
                    covering environmental issues, and how they were pressuring their governments to
                    act against environmental destruction. It had an amazing effect in alerting the
                    Brazilian press to the reality that they had a role to play in shaping public
                    opinion and the environmental policies of their government, as well as taking
                    the heat off us. Even though the worst of the storm had died down, all of a
                    sudden a flood of very professional articles starting appearing about
                    environmental problems in different areas of the country, Our program worked
                    because we arranged contact for the Brazilians with their professional
                    colleagues in other developing and European countries and not just with us. We
                    didn't have a government speaker in the whole seminar. The speakers were all
                    journalists, and the suspicion that the Brazilians were being fed uniquely US
                    policy faded. There is still an ecological problem in the Amazon, but the
                    Brazilians are far more aware of it now than they were, not because of our
                    pressure, but because of their own growing environmental movement.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Brazil, did they look toward the United States or
                        towards Europe. I am talking about the business governing class and
                        all.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well, the man who was the head of our Fulbright program, a very
                    professional Brazilian academic, said to me one day, “You know, it is a terrible
                    thing to be a colony. But to be the colony of an underdeveloped country was
                    really worse.” Today, Portugal is more dependent on Brazil than vice versa.
                    Certainly there are ties to Europe, but they are more commercial than cultural
                    or political. Brazil has far greater access to the American than to the European
                    market. They had great markets in the middle east, particularly in armaments. If
                    you take a look at what is going on in Iraq right now, one of the companies
                    working for us in Iraq is a Brazilian company construction company that is
                    experienced in very large scale projects, and who probably had had contracts
                    with Saddam. So Brazilians are probably less parochial in their view of the
                    world than many developing countries, to the extent that you can call Brazil
                    developing. It is a mix of a highly developed society and a third world society.
                    Rio and Sao Paulo, may have dreadful slums, but they still are world class
                    cities, as are many other cities in the south. The northeast of the country and
                    other areas beyond the reach of the bourgeoning economy are still comparable to
                    areas of the third world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about social life there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: In Brasilia, social life largely involved the diplomatic community. We
                    had some friends in the press, and others who had little or nothing to do with
                    the Embassies, people Adriana knew through teaching at the University of
                    Brasilia, others in business or professional life, and some in the Brazilian
                    government with whom we established personal friendships. But Brasilia was at
                    the time a diplomatic pond. It is the only place I had served where I went to
                    diplomatic parties with some regularity. There were a few restaurants, and a
                    rather nice golf course, which was a great source of relaxation but very much a
                    social club for expatriates and the diplomatic crowd. But Brasilia was a rather
                    isolated place, 700 miles from the coast. It wasn't easy to get in the car and
                    drive somewhere beyond 10 or 20 miles without stocking provisions. So when you
                    weren't flying out of the city, you were living in it. Being able to travel to
                    the other posts at a certain point changed my attitude about Brasilia. Most
                    Brazilian cities are somewhat chaotic, certainly it's the case in Rio and Sao
                    Paulo. They are also hard to get around in and somewhat polluted. The government
                    people were forced to move to Brasilia and hated it, but after awhile they were
                    grateful that their children could walk to school without having their lunches
                    stolen, and that the air was clean and that the slums were conveniently
                    relegated to the shanty towns that had grown outside of the central city.
                    Brasilia itself was close to living in a western-style suburb. Things have
                    changed by now. The city is bigger and traffic is worse, but there is more to do
                    and I think Cariocapeople from Ridon't leave Brasilia on weekends to fly “home”
                    as they used to. Brasilia is now home.</p>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Oh yes. They are highly professional, highly trained, very proud, and
                    very powerful compared to our State Department or Foreign Service, within the US
                    government. You don't do anything in foreign affairs without going through
                    Itamarati, the Brazilian foreign ministry. They are in charge. When there is
                    someone in the ministry of mines or health or commerce who has the title of
                    assistant secretary for foreign affairs, he is a Foreign Service officer from
                    Itamarati. He is not a political appointee and he is not somebody from that
                    agency. He is a diplomat. So can you imagine how powerful the State Department
                    would be if it staffed every office in the bureaucracy that was called Office of
                    the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs? And they are good; they know
                    their stuff. They are good to deal with. The people we dealt with in cultural
                    affairs, in educational affairs, and press relations were terrific to work
                    with.</p>

                        believe it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: There are more terms to describe people of color in Brazil than we
                    have. Here it is largely just black and white. There are many more terms used in
                    Brazil, from “preta” for very dark Afro-Brazilians, through “mulatta” for mixed
                    blood to “morena” for lighter skinned individuals and I'm sure a number of other
                    terms to describe subtle differences. Here, one drop of African blood has
                    typically been used to describe an individual as black. There has certainly been
                    more inter-marriage in Brazil, and mixed couples don't attract attention in most
                    places. But if you are described as “preta” in Brazil you have far less chance
                    of moving in that society than has become the case in the US. We had a regular
                    interaction with Afro-Brazilian organizations that welcomed our bringing
                    African-Americans to Brazil who could help them to understand how the American
                    civil rights movement succeeded so well. A man I later made a film about, John
                    Hope Franklin, was a guest lecturer and was adored by the Brazilians, especially
                    but not only by the Afro-Brazilians.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: He is an historian born in an all-black town in Oklahoma, educated at
                    Fisk and Harvard, who taught in black colleges in North Carolina but became
                    chairman of the history departments of Brooklyn College, the University of
                    Chicago and Duke University. He is now professor emeritus from Duke and Chicago
                    and still writing. He is 88 and authored a boo“From Slavery to Freedom: The
                    History of African-Americans”, that is a standard text now in its eighth or
                    ninth edition.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>Slavery didn't end in Brazil until 1888. It was however, a different transition
                    in Brazil than it was in the United States. Brazil didn't have a civil war. Some
                    people say it is because of the Portuguese heritage of ameliorating differences
                    rather than facing them head on. But they went from a monarchy to a republic,
                    from slavery to emancipation, and from dictatorship to democracy without
                    shedding much blood at all. They took more time to achieve those changes than we
                    did, but with a lot less bloodshed. Today, if you are a light skinned person of
                    African Brazilian heritage with talent, you can move anywhere. If you are dark
                    skinned and you are Pele, you can be the most popular man in the country, the
                    soccer star. If you are born in a slum in one of the favelas above Rio, and
                    don't get much of an education, your only hope is either that you have some
                    talent that will catapult you out of your low station in life, or that you will
                    find an illegal course to wealth. The state of Bahia, especially the city of
                    Bahia, has an African culture with many African traits. The feasts of different
                    African gods whose names I forget are celebrated there as they are in Nigeria
                    and Angola. The famous Mardi Gras in Brazil really amounts to thousands of white
                    people sitting in the stands watching black people having a wonderful time. But
                    it's also true that intermarriage was accepted in Brazil long before that was
                    true in the United States. There is ease of movement among the people who are of
                    mixed ancestry throughout the society, but there are certain classes that feel
                    that they are as isolated and as hopeless as were American blacks in the days of
                    segregation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well is there anything else you think we should cover in
                        Brazil? Maybe one on the cultural side, anything that we did that found the
                        Brazilians particularly responsive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: There were many American touring cultural events that would travel
                    through South America. When we could latch on to one, and could find some money,
                    we would try to get them to one or more Brazilian cities. We had a cultural
                    attach� at the time, Frances Switt, who was a hard driver. She was not as
                    popular among her staff as she was with those of us who appreciated the results
                    of her work. She was a whiz at spotting a show, a Broadway show or a revue that
                    was going to be in South America, and finding either an American or Brazilian
                    company to back it, put some money up in collaboration with us. These events
                    went over very well, since the popular artists in Brazil are a dominant
                    expression of Brazilian culture.</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>Brazilian music, Brazilian dance, are world class, and are a very important part
                    of the world's music. Certainly there is a great interplay among Brazilian
                    popular artists and American. So many Brazilian artists have made it big time in
                    the United States, Tom Jobim being the most famous. And American artists were
                    appreciated by Brazilians, so when shows could come to town and Brazilians could
                    come to see them, especially in Rio and Sao Paulo, they made a big hit. There
                    was a time when the United States government could help underwrite the cost of a
                    tour by the New York Philharmonic or other of our great orchestras. But those
                    days have disappeared. Now we send small groups, and individual artists have
                    come and played and have made important contributions. Brasilia was not a hotbed
                    of cultural activity. It had an orchestral hall built for some reason as a
                    Pyramid, which has nothing to do with Brazilian history, and with dreadful
                    acoustics. It was designed by Oscar Niemeyer. The New York Philharmonic came on
                    its own, with local underwriting, and the Israeli Philharmonic and the Leningrad
                    Philharmonic came with underwriting by their governments and, in the Israeli
                    case, by the local Jewish community. The music starved Brazilian audience was
                    always the same, and it didn't matter what orchestra performed. It didn't make
                    any difference. It was not what drove the relationship or affected it in any
                    meaningful way. Educational exchange was much more important. We had a very good
                    Fulbright program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well was there the pattern that developed in so many other
                        countries in this period, of the young college graduates of the country
                        would go to the United States to get their masters and Ph.D.s in some field,
                        often technical.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: They would not only go to the United States, but to the University of
                    Sao Paulo or Campinas as well and get a first rate Ph.D. in computer science.
                    But the United States was sought after for its educational opportunities. We had
                    a first rate system of educational counseling where students could come in and
                    look through CD ROMs telling them about American universities. Not all of these
                    students would go with American help. It is a little known fact that we had
                    going, at one point, a huge export industry of American education. We are losing
                    that now because of the current security restrictions. But at the time, there's
                    no question that in terms of a destination for advanced education, although
                    Brazilians went to Europe and elsewhere, the most desired education destination
                    was the United States. Competition for Fulbright awards was very intense. Our
                    bi-national Fulbright program in Brazil was the best that I had ever worked
                    with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you left there in '89</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes, in the summer of '89. I was supposed to stay until 1990, but
                    there was a new director of the agency after the election, after the first
                    George Bush became president, who was Bruce Gelb, Chairman of Bristol-Meyers
                    Squibb. I was asked to come up and become the director for Latin American and
                    Caribbean affairs in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we will pick this up the next time when you came up in
                        1989.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, today is 7 September 2004. Stan, 1989. What does being
                        the director of Latin American and Caribbean affairs mean in USIA terms at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well it means being responsible to the director of the Agency for our
                    programming and our personnel in 27 countries in the area. As I remember, at
                    that time we had well over 120 US officers at posts in Latin America and the
                    Caribbean, and more than 600 Foreign Service nationals. The total budget was
                    about $33 million. The posts ranged from huge ones like Brazil and Mexico, where
                    we had in Mexico about 20 Americans and in Brazil at the time about 24 or 25.
                    They were working at multiple posts, seven posts in Brazil and three in Mexico.
                    At small posts like Surinam and Guyana we had one American and a couple of
                    FSN's. But it was an extensive region with varied problems, requiring a good
                    deal of travel, and I think it gave me a very different perception of the
                    realities than you get while working in Washington.</p>
                <p>There you are involved in a lot of policy discussions at State, but can easily
                    lose track of what is happening on the ground. In USIA, even in Washington, we
                    had some tools that would allow us to really interact very directly with the
                    posts. We didn't have a large enough operation to assign a single desk officer
                    for each country, so each of our people were responsible for multiple posts. But
                    they were interacting on a daily basis with most of their posts, answering
                    questions, giving the support from Washington they needed in the field. The
                    Agency had a system requiring annual country plans in which the posts would
                    relay to Washington an analysis of the state of our relationship with the
                    country they dealt with, the problems facing U.S. policymakers in that country
                    that we could help them respond to. Then the posts would list, in priority
                    order, the kind of responses that we could make that would help make American
                    policy better understood, by achieving contact and influence if possible with
                    the people who made the key decisions that affected that nation's response to
                    American policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>Our best tool for rapid reaction was WorldNet. It was a reasonably new tool,
                    introduced by Charles Wick when he was director, in which we could have
                    satellite contact with the major embassies and posts in the world. That meant a
                    large investment in hardware, not only securing transmission contracts on the
                    appropriate commercial satellites for use in the different parts of the world,
                    but also having the means of downloading those transmissions, which required an
                    antenna of varying sizes depending on the proximity and the access of that post
                    to a good signal from the satellite. The result of the use of this tool was to
                    allow us to bring journalists or other opinion leaders into a venue, typically a
                    media room in the American center or the consulate or the embassy, and give them
                    the opportunity to hear a statement from an American figure, one usually but not
                    always a governmental official, and then ask questions of him or her. If
                    necessary, we would use a translator either at the Washington end or at the
                    receiving end.</p>
                <p>Now this technology could be used in a variety of ways. One was as a form of
                    distance learning, where you have a seminar when either the speaker is not
                    available to travel or you don't have the resources to bring one to the post. In
                    many cases a speaker could be made available to more than one post at a time,
                    particularly where there is a fast-breaking event that requires immediate
                    explanation of our action. There were a number of occasions in which this was
                    very valuable. The one that comes to mind immediately was the crisis situation
                    in Panama in which then President Noriega was expected to make a major statement
                    affecting our accusation that Panama was a major transit point for the shipment
                    of illegal narcotics to the US. As I remember he was to address the Panamanian
                    people over a holidaI think it was Labor Day here, and we wanted our position
                    made clear before he spoke. Mike Kozak, who was then a State Department attorney
                    who was assigned to work in the Latin American Area, was a very bright guy,
                    spoke good Spanish, and he agreed to a series of short interviews of 10 or 15
                    minutes each, that we would do directly with press or television in about six
                    different countries in Central America and a couple of major South American
                    capitals. It worked spectacularly well. We got coverage all over the region, and
                    demonstrated that we could use the speed of that technology to deal with a
                    foreseeable problem. You could take the wind out of an event that might
                    otherwise trouble us for a week or a month, trying to catch up with and explain
                    what happened after it happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A question Stan, how did you personally feel and sort of
                        your colleagues about the idea WorldNet was first surfaced? You know this is
                        sort of something coming out of Hollywood. Was there a lot of skepticism or
                        was it jumped on quickly?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: At the time that WorldNet was being introduced I was in Canada. I
                    remember Canada was then part of the European circuit, was in the domain of the
                    assistant secretary for European affairs, and therefore our structure would
                    always follow the State Department in terms of the assignment of individual
                    countries to bureaus. I remember we had long discussions by phone with the home
                    office. Sam Courtney was then director of European affairs in USIA. He wanted
                    all of us to come in with ideas as to what our position should be on the proper
                    use of this new facility. At the time, I pretty much said the same thing I
                    described in terms of what the priority, not the exclusive but the priority use
                    of this tool should be, and that is for rapid response when necessary to bring a
                    key policy figure to an audience, and who was willing to be subjected to the
                    questions of foreign press, foreign media, foreign experts on American policy
                    matters. That became the position of our European area, because it represented
                    the view of a number of other PAOs as well. Now it has demonstrated its
                    usefulness beyond responding to fast breaking events.</p>
                <p>There have been many instances where cultural issues can be usefully the subject
                    of a WorldNet program, but we all felt there was no substitute for the ultimate
                    interaction which is a human being either visiting a post or of our contacts,
                    opinion leaders in foreign countries, visiting the United States. The direct
                    interaction of individuals is the number one tool, I think, not only in public
                    diplomacy but in foreign policy. WorldNet was suspect for the reason you alluded
                    to, because most officers were wary of the tendency of all elements of the U.S.
                    government to rely on new technology to reach their objectives. We all felt that
                    just as strategic bombing didn't win World War II, longdistance communication
                    couldn't always change minds. But most of us felt that getting the Secretary of
                    State or other key officials to talk directly to our audiences and answer their
                    questions via World Net was an extremely effective tool.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, in the first place I guess when you
                        came on board, Nicaragua was still ticking away wasn't it? I mean you talk
                        about you know, the transition from your perspective from the Reagan to the
                        Bush administration in Central America.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well I wasn't in Washington during the Reagan administration. I don't
                    know if there would have been too much difference in the way Nicaragua was
                    handled. We had a post in Nicaragua consisting of one American and a number of
                    Nicaraguans, but it was very difficult to get things to them. We did manage
                    through neighboring posts, usually through Costa Rica, to get materials in. Our
                    post in San Jose was working with Costa Rican radio, giving them materials that
                    were broadcast and heard in Nicaragua. It was indirect, but made a difference.
                    With a presidential election was agreed to by the over confident Sandinistas, we
                    started conducting some training classes in the techniques of campaigning by
                    satellite, held at our Embassy in Managua for invited members of the opposition.
                    We were able to bring people who were experts in monitoring elections into our
                    Washington studios who could exchange ideas with the Nicaraguans. Their
                    experiences weren't always appropriate for conditions in Nicaragua, but at least
                    there was a level of contact that added to the confidence of the opposition. I
                    remember that after the election, when I was able to go down there, we were
                    enthusiastically welcomed by the Chamorro people. I remember there was one thing
                    we did right after the election, or not long after the election, when Denny
                    Martinez, a great pitcher who was from Nicaragua, pitched a perfect game.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who did he play for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: He played for Montreal, and he was the first Nicaraguan to play for a
                    major league baseball team. We wanted him to do a WorldNet interview for the
                    Nicaraguan press. They are great sports fans there and the country adored him.
                    He could have been elected president. He had a very compelling personal story,
                    having overcome alcoholism and rebuilding his career. His family was still
                    living in Nicaragua and he said he would do it. But I remember that the team was
                    traveling to Los Angeles, and we had to arrange for a complicated hook up from a
                    studio there to get the signal into Washington and then to Nicaragua. Our
                    facilities were in the US Embassy, but even the Sandinista press came. In the
                    middle of it, in walked President Chamorro and made a statement so moving,
                    thanking him for raising the spirits of all Nicaraguans and for representing his
                    country so brilliantly, that Martinez was in tears. And even the Sandinista
                    papers had to carry the story, along with her praise of Martinez and of how much
                    he had contributed to the new spirit of democracy in Nicaragua.</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>Now one of the weaknesses of this tool was that it was a one way visual dialogue.
                    It was two ways by voice, but the logistics and expense of allowing a two way
                    visual communication was at the time prohibitive. There were many cases in which
                    people who were new to the format among our foreign audiences would sit there
                    and say, “Wait a second. You mean I can see him, but he can't see me?” This was
                    a very instructive remark because it emphasized again what a dialogue really
                    was. It had to be an exchange of ideas between equals, even if the speaker was
                    of grand rank. It also sometimes didn't work, for instance when we used it
                    during the period in which the ratification of the new Brazilian constitution
                    was the issue. We asked for and got the participation of the then chief justice
                    of the Supreme Court, Warren Burger, to give a talk on the American
                    constitutional process and the role of the judiciary in the interpretation of
                    the constitution, and how it came about. And at the other end in the auditorium,
                    along with many legislators, the press and distinguished judges, there was the
                    aged distinguished Chief Justice of the Brazilian Supreme Court, who could not
                    be seen by Burger, although, of course, Burger could be seen by all. Burger made
                    some nice initial remarks to began his presentation, when the Brazilian justice
                    interrupted, and started an explanation of Brazil's constitutional process,
                    going on and on, hardly taking a breath. We could see Burger's face on the giant
                    screen getting redder and redder and redder. We were relieved once the program
                    ended because if it had gone on much longer I'm afraid Justice Burger would have
                    gotten up and walked out of the studio in Washington, creating a reaction in
                    Brazil that we weren't looking forward to. These days there are alternative
                    means of communicating visually, in which exchanges can be arranged among a
                    small number of peer groups in each country interested in exchanging views on a
                    common subject, and which permit both parties to see each other. I understand it
                    is an increasingly useful tool.</p>

                        Nicaragua, because at one point this is so the focus of the Reagan
                        administration and was playing out when Bush came in. What was the feeling
                        in your office on how this was going to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well, first of all, I think there was total recognition that Nicaragua
                    was a tortured country, mis-governed throughout its history; that the American
                    role in Nicaragua's history had not always been admirable, that the Sandinista
                    regime was pretty much a continuation of the whole story, and this was reflected
                    in reporting from the embassy. There was a great deal of corruption; the
                    Sandinista leaders were enriching themselves in the same manner that Somoza and
                    his predecessors had done. And for whatever reason, including that the contra
                    insurgency that was being underwritten by the United States was probably a drain
                    on their resources, the Sandinistas seem to have decided that the best
                    alternative would be an election that would clear the air and legitimize their
                    rule, and they were certain they would win it. After the victory of the
                    opposition, the United States promised a major assistance grant of, I believe,
                    $500 million to help immediately the process of rebuilding and aiding Nicaragua,
                    which was a desperately poor country, and had suffered terribly during the
                    conflict. Managua had still not been rebuilt after the major earthquake they had
                    suffered some years back. But then El Salvador was in turmoil, as was Panama. I
                    had the feeling that $500 million check was never cashed; it seemed to circulate
                    from country to country like a Christmas fruit cake that everyone gets and
                    passes on to someone else but never gets eaten. I haven't been down there for
                    awhile, but I felt then and still do that this so-called dagger at the heart of
                    American security, this spread of Communism we were going to see marching up
                    through Mexico into Texas, was always a fantasy. Once that bubble was burst, our
                    interest went elsewhere. We never truly followed through on our promises. It is
                    a disgrace that Honduras and Nicaragua especially should be such miserable
                    places with so little hope, so long after we had treated them as the prime focus
                    of American security interests in the entire region. You know, if you are going
                    to be an empire you have really got to first look close to home to make sure
                    there are no problems in your neighborhood, and that you have to make an effort
                    to have decent relationships with what the Russians call their “near abroad.”.
                    For some reason our attention span is too short to be able to follow through,
                    and that almost guarantees we will have problems in Central America again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel at all frustrated that you were here in
                        Washington but you weren't, didn't have any hands on any policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well we did participate regularly in State Department meetings. We had
                    our say on and input into discussions on matters involving that aspect of the
                    issues in Central America and elsewhere that we had the tools to address. But we
                    kid ourselves about the real impact we may have had on policy, or about how much
                    of any of those meetings affected the decision on the issue of the day. What we
                    did have that gave us an advantage was the ability to convey to the posts the
                    flavor of thinking in Washington, and to be of more use to the posts in
                    instilling a better understanding of what in their program planning was
                    realistic and what was not.. We didn't have the huge bureaucracy that State had,
                    and I think I could get a cable out more quickly, or get things done by
                    telephone, and then later by e-mail, than was possible for a desk officer at
                    State, who would have to get endless clearances and revise a message to satisfy
                    every nit-picker.. You know we had also a very difficult resource situation.
                    Almost every year we would have to cut staffing at our posts.</p>
                <p>The typical process was to always cut the big posts because the small posts were
                    down to bare bones. There wasn't much to cut there. So the targets were always
                    the most important places to us like Mexico and Argentina and Brazil. One year I
                    sat down with my people and asked: “Why don't we turn that around. Why are we
                    taking our ammunition away from the places that really count the most to
                    American relations with Latin America.” So we agreed to undertake an experiment
                    in taking two small posts, Surinam and Guyana, and have them served by our post
                    in Trinidad, which was the place that had the best air communications to them.
                    And it was tough to do because the Ambassadors in both those posts didn't want
                    their American USIS officer taken out. We agreed we would leave a local staff of
                    FSN's that could carry on the basic work of distribution of materials, and we
                    would schedule speakers that would serve that mini regional circuit of those
                    three posts and have the Trinidad PAO escort them if necessary. After much
                    wringing of hands and protesting, George Jones, who is now on the AFSA board
                    with me, conceded to the change. He loved the USIS program, thought it was one
                    of the most important tools they had in Guyana, but he reluctantly went along. I
                    think it worked. It wasn't the same as having another hand on deck for the
                    Ambassador to use in that role, but given the alternatives, we thought it was
                    wise. Since then, the situation has gotten much worse. Where we had seven posts
                    in Brazil we now have just three. I don't know the extent to which they have
                    been able to maintain FSN's in consulates, but I think we have lost some of
                    those consulates as well. So in big countries like that, our impact is
                    diminished.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we deal with Cuba or was that sort of taken out of
                        your hands.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Actually the first thing I had on my plate on the first day I walked
                    into my new office was a request to sign off or comment on a memo on the
                    creation of TV Marti. Now we already had a radio Marti, which was widely
                    listened to in Cuba, very hard to jam, and of very good content. I listened to
                    it to satisfy myself that they were doing a professional job, and they were. It
                    wasn't an endless harangue. It was a good news report with the emphasis on Latin
                    America and where we had information on events in Cuba that might not circulate
                    widely in Cuba itself. But this new idea was to deliver a television signal that
                    could be see in Havana and elsewhere on the island.. I did some research on it,
                    I didn't have much time, but it became abundantly clear that television not only
                    would be a much greater threat to the Castro regime than radio, that they would
                    take steps to jam it, but that it was much easier to jam than a radio
                    transmission. Even though it would be an expense for Cuba because they would
                    have to use energy to fire up jammers, they would be compelled to do so. No
                    question about it. So we would be cranking up staff that I think is now about
                    700 people, and sending TV news and other programs to Cuba that few if any
                    Cubans would see. I have seen the result, and it is a pretty good newscast, but
                    since it was clear to all but a few zealots that it would not be seen by Cubans,
                    it was obviously meant only to satisfy the Cuban Americans in Miami, although it
                    would have no effect at all on the movement of information to Cuba. I said that
                    in the memo, and I was told “thank you very much”, and it went on the air.</p>
                <p>The first signals were sent from a tethered balloon in southern Florida or some
                    island off Florida. It broke loose once. To this day despite the fact that much
                    money and effort has been put into the attempt to penetrate Cuba with a TV
                    newscast, it hasn't worked. There was an outfit we later had dealings with when
                    I was working on my final assignment in the State Department in the office of
                    the Undersecretary for Political Affairs. The Air National Guard of Pennsylvania
                    had a plane that could beam information radio or television signals and get
                    under radar. I understand they have recently had some success in Cuba, but they
                    are not going to be able to keep that up. So it's a vain attempt.</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>We pushed other efforts. We placed an officer in Cuba, serving on the staff of
                    the American liaison office, technically an element of the Swiss embassy in
                    Cuba. We were allowed one person in there. We sent good people down there who
                    could really operate on their own. We talked to the Cuban Liaison office here
                    about being able to get American scholars to Cuba as part of our speaker's
                    program, and had permission from our side of the aisle to try to make it happen.
                    Joe Tulchin was head of the Latin American division at the Wilson Center, and he
                    agreed to go to Cuba as our first speaker. It took a long time for the Cubans to
                    respond, and we started getting resistance from some on our side because some
                    felt we would be aiding Cuba in this effort. I didn't feel that sending an
                    American speaker who could represent non-government views on the situation in
                    Latin America and on current scholarship on the continent was more of an asset
                    to Cuba than it was to us. It was a means of starting a dialogue, and of testing
                    whether or not they really wanted any kind of information on an official basis.
                    At the last minute the trip was cancelled; the Cubans declined to give him a
                    visa. I am sure that it was as much a matter of consternation within the Cuban
                    bureaucracy as it was in ours. Since then I think we have gotten some people in
                    who carried out programs. Our presence there is important. Certainly it is
                    important in giving whatever help we could to those people, intellectuals and
                    artists, who have been mistreated because of their opposition to the Castro
                    regime. But American policy has remained in the hands of largely those Cuban
                    Americans who feel that the way to get rid of Castro is with an iron fist rather
                    than a velvet glove. It hasn't worked thus far. There are some signs of change I
                    guess, but the recent moves by this administration to make it more difficult for
                    Cuban Americans to send assistance to their own families could have an effect on
                    the Cuban population in south Florida. I hope it does. I think our policy has
                    been wrong for a long time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Not on my turf, but certainly they had their own bureau. They had
                    Radio and TV Marti within the bureau of broadcasting. That was their home base.
                    They controlled personnel there. They controlled who the newscasters were; they
                    controlled who headed it. The first head of it was a man who was a chemical
                    engineer, Tony Navarro, who was Cuban born, conservative, and a very decent man.
                    We were on good terms, but he was the Ambassador of the Florida Cuban community
                    to Washington, and he had to represent their interests as best he could.</p>

                        Cuban Americans, became more American.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I didn't have that much contact with them because there was only a
                    limited number of things you could do in Cuba. I wasn't allowed to travel there
                    to visit our operation because there was a USG rule against anyone of my rank
                    visiting the Island. There does seem to be less passion about returning to Cuba
                    among American-born Cubans than among those who left Cuba for America. Our
                    general counsel at USIA and I became friendly, and worked together on a number
                    of issues, including of course Cuba. He was Cuban born and came to the US with
                    his parents. He name is Alberto Mora, and his father was a doctor in Cuba, and
                    his mother Hungarian. He seemed to me a very bright, level headed guy who was
                    realistic about what we were doing in Cuba. He was probably a good influence on
                    his Cuban friends, but I doubt if he had any independence when it came to the
                    Radio or TV Marti undertakings and had to handle the legal end of it. I can't
                    say that I knew Jorge Mas Canosa welhe was the head of the Cuban American
                    National Foundation and his son took over after his father's death. He was a
                    powerful force in Washington. TV Marti was his baby. He was at almost every
                    meeting on a Cuban subject that I attended, and I think his presence had a
                    stultifying affect on the discussions, because his influence within the Reagan
                    and Bush administrations on Cuban matters was enough to ruin a diplomatic
                    career. He was a self-made millionaire and single minded on US-Cuban relations,
                    seeing to it that no activities took place that would indicate an accommodation
                    with Cuba as long as Castro was alive. And upon Castro's death, he envisioned a
                    return to the island by him and his friends in Miami who would be welcomed as
                    heroes and would create a capitalistic, democratic Cuba.</p>
                <p>I am sure there are great divisions and all shades of political feeling within
                    the Cuban community about this. What I am afraid of, what a lot of people are
                    afraid of, is that when Castro dies, there will be a struggle between the people
                    who stayed in Cuba and resisted and those who stayed behind, with the Communists
                    waging a rear-guard battle..The people in Miami seem to think that with the
                    money that they gave and with their influence, they will go to Cuba and remake
                    it, reclaim their property, all the rest of it. I am not so sure that is going
                    to happen. I think it is going to be a very difficult matter for the United
                    States to handle because the people who stayed are going to have a very
                    legitimate claim to keep what they think were useful contributions of the Castro
                    erhealth and education mostland throw out the rest.</p>

                        in the country have little to no regard for those who left. We are seeing
                        this in Iraq, we are seeing this in Germany back after the war. It just
                        doesn't work. The people who have gone away, they are seen as traitors.</hi>

                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well Willy Brandt had that around his neck, and yet he did become

                    resources between the Miami Cubans and the island itself is going to make it
                    more conflictive. One would hope that by the time it happens, there would be
                    greater sensitivity, if I can use that word. I understand it is out of favor in
                    Washington, but greater sensitivity among the Cubans in Miami as to how to
                    handle their return. It would be wonderful if a delegation went into the interim
                    government of Cuba after the fall of Castro and said, “What can we do to help?”
                    Instead of saying, “We want our property back. Get out of my house.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Was much of the Latin American program information program
                        directed at limitingCuban influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: To a great extent by the time I was running the Latin American
                    operation, Castro's influence in Latin America had diminished very greatly.One
                    of our major focuses at the time was to encourage the growth of free markets in
                    Latin America. I remember there was a very major program organized jointly by
                    Treasury and State which would feature a conference in Latin America with David
                    Rockefeller as the star attraction. Before he left, we had him do a number of
                    interviews with economic writers in a number of countries in Latin America by
                    WorldNet. He was talking to people who had once been very taken with the
                    socialist transformation of Cuba but who, despite retaining an admiration for
                    Fidel for standing up to the U.S., had seen the Cuban economy atrophy under
                    Castro's rule. Rockefeller was greeted with some suspicion, since there's always
                    suspicion and paranoia in Latin America and elsewhere when we start talking
                    about free enterprise. He was able to lay out very frankly what our hope was,
                    and that was for a growth of trade between the United States and Latin America
                    on a more even basis. Much of the turn towards open markets and freer trade in
                    Latin America came as a consequence of that effort, but the return of economic
                    difficulties in the continent has led to the return by some of those
                    governments, with the possible exceptions of Chile and Mexico, to the old
                    protectionism of the past.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's turn to Panama. When you arrived, what was the
                        situation particularly with Noriega and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: This is hard for me to remember because for a long time Noriega was
                    one of our favorites, despite his corruption, until he ran afoul of our concern
                    about the growing drug problem. It wasn't long into my tenure that in the middle
                    of the night I got a call saying that we had gone in with military force. I had
                    to call the then deputy director, Gene Kopp, wake him up about two or three in
                    the morning. He wanted to know why we weren't given a heads-up by State. It was
                    an embarrassment for me, but all information had been very closely held. Edward
                    R. Murrow once said to his counterparts at the State Department when he was
                    director of USIA: “You have got to let us in on the takeoff and not just the
                    crash landing.” And that was never truer than in this instance. Certainly the
                    invasion of Panama was having repercussions all over Latin America. We just
                    played catch up. We got someone before dawn over to the task force, and had
                    someone on that task force throughout that crisis. It was not that difficult a
                    public affairs problem within Panama after it was over because Noriega didn't
                    have that great a following in his own country. It was a plutocracy and
                    everybody knew it. I don't know how much better off it is today, but presumably
                    the drug matter is somewhat more under control. Drugs were the issue as far as
                    we were concerned in Panama, but also in many countries in Latin America where
                    drugs were either grown, manufactured, or transported,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you do anything to respond to the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: In most places we were aiming our efforts at the widespread phenomenon
                    that countries involved in the drug trade inevitably found the epidemic
                    spreading to their own children. In Brazil, before I arrived there and while I
                    was there, the post had developed a strategy of enlisting the efforts of the
                    wives of state governors to head a campaign warning young people of the dangers
                    of drugs. The program was started by our post in Sao Paulo, and they got a
                    number of governor's wives involved to good effect. But nonetheless, drugs were
                    flowing into Brazil, at that time, from Bolivia, and found their way throughout
                    the country. Rio was probably the most affected. There were materials produced
                    in USIA which reflected the same themhandle the stuff and your children will
                    suffebut in truth, I don't know how much an effect our efforts achieved.</p>
                <p>Another effort we made was to enlist the energies of the governments of the
                    Andean and other countries, but first of all the Andeans, in coordinating our
                    information efforts to curb drug use. I think we succeeded in five countries in
                    signing memorandums of cooperation between our government and theirs. Peru and
                    Colombia were the first to sign, and several others came along later. It was not
                    a transformative undertaking, but we were able to help them by sending our
                    materials to them in Spanish so that they could use them as a basis for their
                    own campaigns, modifying them to address their own situations more precisely. We
                    also used speakers from the appropriate US agencies, either as traveling
                    speakers or on WorldNet, to bring audiences of professionals in the field up to
                    date on what our thinking was on how to turn the tide. But the DEA and others
                    responsible for the effort were in very close contact with their counterparts
                    abroad, so we didn't try to program to the professionals.</p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about how you were focused on Central
                        America then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Yes, Central America and the Andes were in the limelight because,
                    during my tenure, the Bush administration developed a heavy focus on
                    counteracting drug traffic. Our director, Bruce Gelb, liked to find ways to be
                    part of the action. We suggested very early on after the program was announced
                    that he visit the Andean countries, go down there and see what the posts were
                    doing, and get more familiar with what the problems were. He jumped at the
                    chance, and we went down to Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia. He spent a couple of
                    days talking to people in La Paz, but we couldn't get down to the Chaparral
                    where the drugs were growing. In Peru, a country a friend of mine called “the
                    Saudi Arabia of coca”, we were flown by helicopter into an advanced base where
                    destruction of coca plants was taking place. I assure you, flying over those
                    fields where coca growers lurked you wanted a helmet to sit on. It was pretty
                    dicey. We actually set down with armed men all around us on a hill side where
                    coca plants had been burnt to show us the effectiveness of certain defoliants.
                    Then on to Colombia, where we had briefings from the ambassador and met with
                    some of the Colombian officials working on the drug problem. When we returned to
                    Washington, a member of Gelb's staff told me that he felt that he had gotten a
                    good feeling for what USIS was doing. USIS remember, is the name that we used
                    overseas, U.S. Information Service rather than U.S. Information Agency, because
                    that had been the historic name while it was still part of the Department of
                    State. I think it's useful for a director who is generally stuck in Washington
                    to get out into the field, even if it is going to an embassy for a reception,
                    being feted in the capital and then moving on and getting briefings by the post.
                    But to get out in the field and see something as dramatic as he did, made him
                    feel much closer to the problem. Then of course, from our standpoint, we could
                    hope for greater support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Gelb's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Gelb was chairman of Bristol Meyers-Squibb. His brother was the Chief
                    operating officer. After he left USIA he became ambassador to Belgium. His
                    father was an entrepreneur who brought Clairol to this country from Germany
                    where it was called Klein-all, because the man who developed it was named Klein.
                    He told me a story about how his mother had smuggled the formula back to the
                    U.S. just before war broke out in her brassiere. In any case his background was
                    as a businessman. He had been a fund raiser in New York for Bush. He was new to
                    government, and that is one of the reasons why I felt that kind of travel was
                    useful to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel that in his own way he was trying to
                        compete with Charlie Wick who had made such an impact and was so close to
                        Ronald Reagan, Mrs. Reagan really.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I didn't get that feeling. He had a very different style. Charlie Wick
                    was a friend of Ronald Reagan, although. I don't think he was a Reaganaut. He
                    was not super conservative. He was just a friend of Ronald Reagan's. They raised
                    their children together. They lived next door to each other. It was an enormous
                    benefit to the U. S. Information Agency when the Washington newspapers reported
                    that President and Mrs. Reagan spent Christmas Eve at their home with the Wicks.
                    That message was heard all over town. I never had the disadvantage of working
                    cheek by jowl with him, although some of those who did had to put up with ideas
                    that seemed zany at first and some people found it difficult to say no to him.
                    If they did, they sometimes paid the consequences. I was told that a bright guy
                    named Bob Earle, who worked for him, apparently once had an ash tray thrown at
                    him. But Charlie Wick treated him very well, and he got good assignments
                    thereafter including Mexico as PAO. But Wick did have the one thing that every
                    bureaucrat wants in the leader of his agency, the ability to get money, and we
                    prospered during that period, although you had to talk him down from some things
                    that just weren't going to work. But all in all, he made a very important and
                    valuable impact on the Agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Argentina come across your radar more or less? I mean
                        Argentina has always struck me as here is this country with everything going
                        for it and nothing works.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: Well it comes across my attention more forcefully because my wife is
                    from Buenos Aires. I have visited there several times as area director, and a
                    number of times since I left the service. Argentina is one of the few countries
                    in the world that is self sufficient in energy and food. It has an educated
                    European population. At the time of the beginning of the war it was either the
                    fourth or seventh leading country in per capita GDP, depending on whose
                    statistics you accept. You still see the grandeur of the place when you go down
                    there. I don't know if you have been to Buenos Aires. It is a European city,
                    with the highest concentration of psychologists per capita in the world. It has
                    a thriving culture, great restaurants, and wonderful food. I hate to tell a
                    Texan this, but the greatest meat in the world is in Argentina, along with some
                    wonderful wines and attractive, intelligent people.</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>They can't get it together because they have been mis-governed for so long. Like
                    many countries in Latin America, but certainly in Brazil and Argentina, holding
                    minor office is a route to great wealth. State elected officials retire after a
                    few years at multiples of their salaries, and the federal government is forced
                    to pay the bill. These are regimes that have encouraged the growth of cynicism
                    about government, and without a citizenry that has faith in the government, it
                    is very difficult to find anything good that can come from such a situation.
                    They have been disappointed over and over by people who they thought would
                    finally lift them out of chaos. There was a period there when the government
                    tied the peso to the dollar. It had the immediate effect of attracting
                    investment and boosting the value of the peso but it couldn't be sustained. It
                    couldn't be sustained because they couldn't control inflation. So just as in
                    Mexico it wasn't a slow leakage, it was a burst of the dam when the country goes
                    down. You have got to adjust the exchange rate when the situation calls for it.
                    There wasn't a hell of a lot we could do in Argentina except show the flag,
                    programs about rational economics, maintain the relationship. As elsewhere in
                    Latin America, we had these wonderful bi-national centers. The Bi-national
                    Center of Buenos Aires is a great independent institution with 10,000 students
                    or so learning English and bringing people in close proximity to American
                    culture. So we maintain the dialogue; we maintain the relationship. But the
                    institution that affected policy more than any other, including the U.S.
                    government, was the IMF. They determined in effect what the relationship would
                    be because we got blamed for whatever the IMF would do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go then? This would be '92.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: I was called in by then director Henry Catto. Catto was a man of great
                    charm and intelligence who was from Texas, had been spokesman for the Defense
                    Department, had been ambassador to El Salvador, and to the Court of St. James,
                    spoke excellent Spanish, and was the best director of USIA that I had personal
                    dealings with, perhaps because I was in Washington for a longer time and was at
                    a higher rank, permitting me to have more contact with the Director. Perhaps I
                    am unfair to others whom I haven't had as much contact with. But he was a great
                    pleasure to work for. He suggested to Larry Eagleburger, who was then the Deputy
                    Secretary of State, that we needed to have a USIA officer at the State
                    Department at a level where he could have some input into discussions of current
                    policy, and bring resources of the Agency to bear as appropriate, and also keep
                    the Agency informed as to where it could direct its fire. Although every area
                    director was plugged in to his or her regional bureau, Catto felt one step
                    higher would help, and Eagleburger agreed. Catto asked me to go over to work in
                    the office of the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, the third
                    highest position at State, who was at the time Arnold Kanter.</p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>I went over and met the Undersecretary and we had a good talk and worked out a
                    lofty title of Coordinator for Foreign Information Policy. It was a total
                    mystery to everybody at State and USIA. They found me an office and allowed me
                    to bring an assistant with me, who was Joe Bob Johnson, my policy officer at the
                    Latin American division. We were also given a State Department secretary.
                    Shortly after I got there I called Deputy Secretary Eagleburger, who I knew some
                    because we were both at the University of Wisconsin at the same time. He was a
                    senior when I was a freshman or a sophomore. I was a staff member of the
                    rabble-rousing student newspaper, the Daily Cardinal, and he was the head of the
                    Young Republicans. We met again in Brussels, when he was the political advisor
                    to NATO and I was the information officer at the embassy. We did have contact
                    there; he had dinner at my house and when I was leaving Brussels for Korea he
                    and a colleague of his took me to a farewell lunch. I've always been proud to
                    have known him. It was a great achievement for him personally and a great honor
                    for the Foreign Service to have a career officer become Secretary of State.
                    Catto had taken my name to Eagleburger and he said fine, so I called him up and
                    said, “Ok you have gotten me here; now what do I do?” He said, “Anything you
                    can.” And I came to realize that that was the way things operated at State. You
                    carved out your own area of operations and did it until and unless someone
                    pushed back.</p>
                <p>Arnie Kanter and I talked over my own view of what I should be doing and, since
                    the major concern of the US at the time was the situation in Yugoslavia, I
                    decided that is where we could really best put our energies immediately. There
                    were opposition radio and television stations in Belgrade whose message was not
                    heard throughout the country. They didn't have the technical means to do it
                    because their transmission equipment was weak and apparently in poor repair,
                    largely because of the absence of spare parts. So we decided we would try to
                    help there. Marvin Stone, the former Deputy Director of USIA under Charles Wick,
                    had taken over an organization named the International Media Foundation that
                    provided help in building democratic media. He was a former defense writer and
                    then editor of U.S. News and World Report. We became very good friends when he
                    was in USIA, particularly after he came down to speak for us in Brazil while I
                    was PAO. His organization was an AID grantee and I heard that they had bought
                    $235,000 of spare parts and other things that the independent television station
                    in Belgrade could use to strengthen its signal, but they couldn't get it in
                    because there was a UN embargo on shipments to Serbia.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>So Joe Johnson and I got a meeting together of interested parties in different
                    bureaus in State. We found out that the antenna that was then being used by the
                    Belgrade television station was in fact one that had been put on long term loan
                    to them years before by the United States government, acting through USIA. We
                    suggested that the International Media Fund's material could also be offered as
                    a long term loan, and that would, since it remained USG material, give us the
                    right to send it through the diplomatic pouch., making it a permissible shipment
                    despite the embargo and safe from mis-handling by Milosevic's henchmen, who were
                    giving the independent media a hard time. The group reached agreement on that,
                    and Marvin was delighted at the prospect of getting the material out of London,
                    where it was awaiting transshipment. We sent a telegram with what we thought was
                    the good news to Belgrade, informing the embassy of our plans. The embassy at
                    that time was headed by the charge', the Deputy Chief of Mission in the absence
                    of an Ambassador. He sent back a response saying that such an act would bring
                    potential physical danger to bear on the staff of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade.
                    I couldn't believe that response, since the Serbs had many better excuses to
                    threaten harm to our people than what we were planning, and physical harm would
                    obviously escalate the tension between us to a level that Milosevic had thus far
                    avoided. We got another meeting together, and Joe and I were the only ones on
                    the room who supported asking the DCM to give us a better justification for his
                    fears than was provided in his initial response. Nobody in the State Department
                    wanted to second guess a DCM who raised the possibility of physical harm coming
                    to our people. I called our PAO there, Mike Hoffman who had been my deputy in
                    Brazil, and I asked, “Is this real?” He said he thought the DCM had just dug in
                    his heels. Nobody at the post wanted to send a dissent message, so we were
                    stuck.</p>
                <p>Then the question came up as to what alternative was possible.. The most feasible
                    was to go to the United Nations and seek an exemption from the embargo. We
                    discussed that with the British who thought it was a good idea. The issue went
                    to the Security Council, and it gave us the exemption. So the shipment went, and
                    it was brought to the Yugoslavian border by truck from Budapest. The truck
                    crossed the border and was promptly hijacked, and probably distributed to
                    Milosevic's favored stations. I don't think Marvin Stone ever forgave me, but we
                    had to make the effort. Our friends in Yugoslavia knew we were trying. In
                    retrospect, I thought I could have gone to Larry Eagleburger and asked him if he
                    really wanted to let the DCM call the shots, but that was really Arnie Kanter's
                    call, and I had enough respect for him not to try an end run. I was very
                    disappointed by the inability of people at State to look at this realistically.
                    It was a CYA reaction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cover your ass.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: That's right. Because if a drop of blood was shed, it could be traced
                    to a decision to move this equipment in, and they feared that the blame might
                    land on their desk. Well it seemed to me to be so remote a possibility that the
                    Yugoslavians were going to do something stupid. The real risk of danger was not
                    to us, but to the people at the independent radio and TV stations who were ready
                    to take the risk of Milosevic's people coming down hard on them.</p>
                <p>Our other major issue was what to do with the VOA/Radio Free Europe plan to build
                    a $200 million transmitting station in Israel for the purpose of improving our
                    signal to central Asia, something that was conceived before the Cold War ended.
                    It was something we really forced on the Israelis, although they were good
                    sports about it, and they had received an advanced payment of about 16 million
                    dollars to offset their local costs. They gave us land out in the Negev Desert,
                    but it turned out that it was on a flyway, migratory flyway, for birds flying
                    from Europe to Africa. It became contentious among environmentalists. The
                    Israelis said if you want us to go ahead we will; we won't back out, but if we
                    go ahead you are creating a new problem for us.</p>
                <p>Eagleburger was dead set against this. I was assigned to head a task force that
                    would meet, discuss it, and make a policy recommendation as to what to do. We
                    discussed it in a meeting that drew too many people, including large numbers of
                    people from VOA and RFE, as well as people from State and the Board of
                    Broadcasting. We sat down to prepare a summary of the discussion with the points
                    made by the broadcasting people, the key one being that they felt the need to
                    have a third backup to their existing two signals in order to guarantee a strong
                    signal to the stanUzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and the others.. But even
                    before we completed the analysis and recommendation an editorial appeared in the
                    Washington Times containing all of the discussion that had gone on in what was
                    supposed to be a confidential meeting, obviously leaked by Radio Free Europe or
                    VOA or both. I was singled out in the editorial for criticism, and no one in
                    State public affairs wanted to respond to it. But we went ahead and made the
                    only recommendation that made sense, that the overblown project be terminated,
                    and it was to the great dismay of its proponents.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>The key question, when you got right down to it, was why on earth we needed a
                    three tier signal capability in central Asia that was worth not only $200
                    million, but would also create domestic problems for the host country, Israel?.
                    This was not some new broadcasting target, one that would open up an area of the
                    world that was denied to us. It was overkill. It was being pushed by Steve
                    Forbes, who was the head of Radio Free Europe at the time. We had exchanged some
                    harsh words at a meeting held at USIA on the issue, mostly because of his
                    bad-mouthing Foreign Service officers for resisting his plans. But nonetheless
                    the recommendation prevailed, and the USG was spared a $200 million expense,
                    with the exception, we thought, of the $16 million we had pre-paid to Israel for
                    site surveys and other expenses. But a good friend of mine, Mort Smith, who had
                    been my PAO in Korea and was then Deputy Director of VOA for facilities, was
                    asked to go to Israel and see how much of that $16 million could be recovered.
                    He was a nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn with a very direct manner, who had
                    negotiated the original agreement with the Israelis, and he came back with all
                    of the $16 million. No one could believe it, including Mort. I think the
                    Israelis must have been so happy about the cancellation of the project that they
                    felt the $16 million was worth it to get the monkey off their backs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you doing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZUCKERMAN: For a year. We also related to a number of the geographical and
                    functional bureaus on some initiatives. We helped the Bureau of Economic Affairs
                    avoid a mishap because they were issuing a paper on trade. Despite the fact it
                    dealt mostly with imbalances in our trade with Asia, the only country they were
                    mentioning was Japan, which was not the only country in Asia with which we were
                    running a trade deficit. It was a needless provocation and they agreed. I also
                    on a weekly basis attended the director's meeting at USIA, and as you know, the
                    State Department has a couple of different internal computer communications
                    systems. Joe and I had access to the one that the senior officers of the
                    department had. Sometimes the top USIA people didn't know abut a meeting that
                    was going to be held that really involved us, that is, when it was on an issue
                    that we should have had input into. So I think I helped improve communications
                    between us as did Joe, because he was going to meetings as well. So I thought
                    that it would be a good idea to continue placing a USIA officer at a prominent
                    level at State.</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>Well after the election, Peter Tarnoff was named to replace Arnie Kanter, and I
                    heard that they wanted to streamline the seventh floor, where the Secretary and
                    other senior officials were housed. They thought many offices, including the
                    Undersecretaries, had added too many appendages, and they wanted to place them
                    elsewhere. I met with Tarnoff on a Saturday morning, and he said he thought the
                    work we were doing was very valuable, but that it should be placed in the office
                    of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. I said that could work, but that
                    it would not give the person who held the job the access that came from being a
                    part of the Undersecretary's office, which was the purpose for the creation of
                    the position. Also, there were misgivings in Assistant Secretary Margaret
                    Tutwiler's office when this move was made. So I had made it one of the first
                    things I did when I arrived at State to have a meeting with her, to explain what
                    I understood my job was, and that in no way would it overlap with her
                    responsibilities. As I remember, she didn't say anything during the whole
                    meeting except OK. But Tarnoff felt that we had to unclutter the Undersecretary
                    of State's office, and there were several other offices that were nominally
                    attached to it.</p>
                <p>So I went back to USIA. They offered me postings to Madrid, Tel Aviv, New Delhi,
                    several other very nice assignments. But my wife had dug into the job of her
                    dreams, at the World Bank. Adriana was an educator. She had a Ph.D. in
                    international relations and developmental economics from the University of
                    Texas. When we got back to Washington in August of 1989, she set her mind on
                    getting a job where she had always wanted to work, at the World Bank. By January
                    she was working for them, and she still is. So I had to make a decision at that
                    point. because USIA was pretty strict about how long you stayed in the US
                    between overseas tours. I think the State Department was very flexible, but USIA
                    was not. I was coming up on the six year limit. The new director of USIA was
                    Joseph Duffy, who I had met on several occasions over the years, and we met in
                    his office to talk about what he wanted to do with me. We talked about my going
                    down to run television, or what used to be the television and film operation
                    which by now was almost exclusively television. He thought he needed someone
                    down there that could keep it involved with the rest of USIA, and although
                    retirement and a new career was a definite consideration for a number of
                    reasons, I might have stayed if that job were offered to me, even if it meant
                    forgoing some financial advantages that the federal government was phasing out.
                    But the job was given to a political appointee, and when the Agency was merged
                    with State, television was given to the Board of Broadcasting along with VOA, an
                    enormous mistake in my mind. And so I decided to retire.</p>
                <p>I spent my last year as a member of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at
                    Georgetown University, conducted a seminar on public diplomacy and organized a
                    colloquium participated in by the other Institute members, and wrote a paper on
                    the future of the Fulbright Program. I also thought seriously about what I
                    wanted to do in retirement, because I heard from somebody, and I thought it was
                    very good advice, that you shouldn't retire from something, you should retire to
                    something.</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>I decided I wanted to make documentary films again, although I had made them in a
                    distant manner in USIA, picking the subjects and overseeing the productions
                    along with my other responsibilities for the film and television division. I put
                    together a proposal and got together with Tim White, the then young producer who
                    carried out the Reflections series with USIA, who had gone on to a commercial
                    television career. We decided to form a non-profit corporation to make films.
                    The Corporation for Public Broadcasting liked the idea when we showed them what
                    we had done for USIA and gave us some start up money to produce treatments on
                    three potential individuals. Before I did this I had gotten a ruling from the
                    USIA legal department that I could organize on paper a non-profit corporation as
                    long as I wasn't working at it, and we did that.</p>
                <p>When I retired in October or right at the end of September, 1994, we were able to
                    start almost at once. In the period since then, we have made three major films
                    for PBS. This series is called First Person Singular because PBS didn't want to
                    use a title that had been used in government films. Our first film was on
                    architect I.M. Pei, the second on historian John Hope Franklin, and the third on
                    Nobel Laureate Elie Wessel. We did another private film for the North Carolina
                    Council on the Humanities on Charles Kuralt, the CBS broadcaster who was to
                    receive their 25th anniversary humanitarian award, but died before the award was
                    to be given at a banquet. The film treated his career and showed how close his
                    work mirrored the kind of activities that the Council on the Humanities was
                    carrying out.</p>
                <p>We started a film on Beverly Sills that we may be able to pick up at a later
                    time, but we had a disagreement with her agent over where we could raise the
                    money. So it has been an interesting retirement, involving a good deal of travel
                    in connection with the productions. I've done some travel with my wife on her
                    working trips to Asia, the Middle East and Africa. I see more of my children and
                    grandchildren. I don't do as much reading as I would like because fund raising
                    is so hard and so constant. Films are expensive, especially if you have to meet
                    the quality standards of PBS. I have eight grandchildren. Two of them are in
                    England, and six of them live within a half hour of us, and they keep me very
                    busy..</p>
