                <p>CLAUDE “CLIFF” GROCE</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Jack O'Brien </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 8, 1988</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cliff, if you will begin, please, by identifying yourself,
                        your full name, address, serial number, and anything else that establishes
                        who you are. That's the way to begin, perhaps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Entrance Into VOA (Through Department of State): 1950</p>
                <p>GROCE: My full name, regrettably, is Claude Bethany Groce, which is why I adopted
                    the name Cliff many years ago when I went into radio. I decided, while I was
                    still in college, that I wanted to work for the Voice of America, and so after
                    getting a degree in radio broadcasting, I went back and got another degree in
                    international relations.</p>
                <p>I applied for an internship in the Department of State, hoping to work for the
                    VOA, which was then a part of the Department of State, and was fortunate enough
                    to be chosen as an alternate, and then wound up getting into the program.</p>
                <p>I began work September 18, 1950, had three work assignments as an intern, first
                    in the Bureau of European Affairs, the Division of East European Affairs, which
                    was the backstop for the VOA. My second work assignment was in the Bureau of
                    German Affairs, and the third was with the Voice in its Washington branch, in
                    the penthouse of the Interior Building in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you reported for duty to the Voice, technically, on
                        what date again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: April 7, 1951 was my first day as an intern. July 9 was my first day as a
                    regular employee.</p>
                <p>Early Assignment: Special Events Office in Washington While VOA Headquarters was
                    Still in New York</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your first job at the Voice?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>GROCE: I was a Special Events Officer. At that time, I started as a GS-6. The
                    Washington branch consisted of a Special Events unit, a news unit, and some
                    specialized writers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, of course, the headquarters was in New
                        York.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Headquarters was in New York. So we were a very small, 18-people adjunct
                    of the VOA in New York. There were two people in 1778, as it was then,
                    Pennsylvania Avenue, attached to the IPS news operation, who wrote newscasts for
                    broadcasts from Washington or transmission by teletype from Washington to the
                    New York newsroom. We did two live newscasts a day from Washington.</p>
                <p>The first day I was on duty, I was given the responsibility of broadcasting a
                    15-minute newscast to Europe in the afternoon, our time, evening European time.
                    I hadn't been on the air in many months, and I was scared to death broadcasting
                    to this kind of an audience, and it went off without a hitch.</p>
                <p>We covered the Hill, we covered the departments, especially the State Department,
                    obviously, in support of program elements in the foreign languages and
                    English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember, Cliff, either the first or one of the
                        first special events you covered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Oh, dear. I can remember highlights of the period; I can't remember the
                    first. Oh, yes, I do! I remember the first interview I did was with the
                    lobbyist—or a lobbyist—for the potato industry in the United States.
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] Sounds exciting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Because one of the programs that the New York office was engaged in at the
                    time was a study of how Americans, as private citizens, influence and affect the
                    operations of the government that serves them. They wanted a lobbyist in the
                    process, and, of course, Washington is the home of most of the lobbyists. So
                    that was the first guy, now that you remind me.</p>
                <p>I think the second person I interviewed was Howard Mitchell, music director of
                    the National Symphony Orchestra, who was a princely gentleman, a very fine cello
                    player, and an absolutely lousy orchestra director.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Special Events led to what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Groce Transferred to Motion Picture ServiceQuits Government Work</p>
                <p>GROCE: I was in that job until the summer of 1953, when there came a gigantic RIF
                    in the information program. John Foster Dulles had made it clear that he did not
                    want anything to do with the information program; he wanted it out from under
                    the State Department. Two studies were going on simultaneously in the executive
                    branch of the government to come up with some alternative means of using this
                    institution. It had been decided that a separate agency for information purposes
                    would be set up on August 1, 1953.</p>
                <p>In the big RIF, I was transferred. I was not RIFed because I had permanent
                    status, but I was transferred to the Motion Picture Service of the State
                    Department, IIA at that time, the International Information Administration. I
                    had been a GS-7 by the time I left VOA, although I'd been doing a GS-12 job, so
                    I had been treated like one of the family. Suddenly, I found myself back in an
                    almost clerical role in another part of the information program, and I was very
                    unhappy in that role. So I decided to quit and go back to California, and I gave
                    my two weeks' notice. They were very nice people working in the Motion Picture
                    Service; it had nothing to do with the professional caliber of the people, but I
                    just was in an unhappy position in that organization. So I chose, rather than to
                    stay in that reassignment, to quit.</p>
                <p>Significant Special Assignments Preceding Resignation</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cliff, in reviewing your career so far, are there some
                        instances that stand out of good doing, of poor doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: There were a number of interesting developments during this period. Of
                    course, it was the beginning of the McCarthy era, but quite aside from that,
                    since that was really affecting the New York operation of the Voice, the
                    coverage of the Hill was one of the most interesting aspects. This is before we
                    had a bureau. We were on sufferance, so that if we were using a booth, normally
                    we would be assigned to the Mutual Broadcasting System booth to do our VOA
                    recordings.</p>
                <p>I shall never forget one time I was interviewing a senator, and about two minutes
                    into the interview, the Mutual reporter showed up to do a two-minute spot, and
                    we had to get out of the booth, and I lost my interview because the guy wasn't
                    going to stay around that long.</p>
                <p>There was another time in which I had tried to get Senator Theodore Francis
                    Greene of Rhode Island. Remember him?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, indeed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: He wound up staying until he was 96 years old or so. I scheduled him for
                    an interview, and I had given him a time of 3:30 for the appointment. Well, in
                    the meantime, while I was going around trying to find other senators to
                    interview, Senator Greene showed up at 3:00 in the Senate radio-TV gallery. So
                    when I got back about 25 minutes after 3:00, ready to greet him at 3:30 when he
                    was due to arrive, he was sitting there in an absolute huff. I explained that
                    I'd been seeking Senator So-and-so and Senator So-and-so, and I thought our
                    agreement was for 3:30, and he stood up to his 4'8” height and said, “But I am a
                    senator, too!” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>I think one of the most interesting experiences I had during this period was in
                    interviewing Jean Monnet, who was here for a conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Will you identify him for the benefit of the readers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Jean Monnet was the father of European unity, in effect. He built the coal
                    and steel community, and he was just one of the great men of a potentially
                    united Europe. He was staying at the French Embassy while he was here for this
                    meeting, and I scheduled an interview for 9:00 o'clock in the morning, the only
                    time he could give me. The engineer and I arrived at the front door of the
                    French Embassy and were ushered in by a butler, standing in the lobby of the
                    place. And bounding down the curving stairway came a massive black French
                    poodle, and I feared for our lives, but he was brought under control by the
                    butler. We were escorted up this beautiful stairway into a little anteroom off
                    the suite where Monnet was living. In a few minutes, here comes Monnet in his
                    bathrobe, slippers, freshly shaven and powdered, and so I interviewed him in his
                    bathrobe.</p>
                <p>I was recently out of college and very impressed with my own knowledge of the
                    situation in Europe, and I'd carefully written out eleven very well thought-out
                    questions, very complicated, showing my erudition. I showed them to Monsieur
                    Monnet, and he read them over, and he said, “This is much too complicated.” He
                    said, “These are very good questions, but your listeners have two interests, two
                    concerns: Will we have peace? Will we have bread? And everything we say must be
                    addressed to one of those objects.” And we sat there and rewrote the 11
                    questions into three, and it was a beautiful interview. The man was a superb
                    subject, and I never forgot that lesson as long as I've been in the
                    business.</p>
                <p>It was interesting, back to the Hill, the difference between the attitudes of the
                    people on the Hill—that is, the congressmen and the senators on the Hill—toward
                    the Voice of America and its workers, as compared with the attitudes of the
                    commercial broadcasters and the other commercial press people. We could not get
                    credentials, we could not be members of the galleries. Everything was on
                    sufferance, as I mentioned, the mutual booth. Not until the 1980s did the Voice
                    get accreditation on the Hill.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you remember the names of some of the people at the
                        Voice that we should take note of? Who, for example, was director of the
                        Voice in New York? And other names of people you can recall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: When I joined the Voice, Foy Kohler was the director, who later became
                    ambassador to Moscow. After Kohler, as I recall, the man who took over was “Doc”
                    Morton. I don't remember his first name, but his nickname was “Doc.” Maybe it
                    was Erickson who preceded Morton. I'm very unclear about that period. I've got
                    all kinds of conflicting information in my own files.</p>
                <p>Morton would arrive at the morning meetings, the 9:30 policy meetings of the VOA
                    staff in New York—again, I was in Washington, so this is all second-hand—and
                    greet the assembled multitude with, “Good morning, warriors.” Meaning, of
                    course, cold warriors.</p>
                <p>In the Washington branch, of which I was a part, Sid Sulkin was the chief. Head
                    of the Special Events operation was John Hogan. His deputy was Keith Jameson. We
                    also had specialized people who were not in the Special Events unit, but who
                    wrote for the Far East Division in New York or for other specialized operations.
                    We had a man who wrote commentaries for broadcasts. We had our own policy
                    office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Barry Zorthian around at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Barry was in New York. Yes, he was around, but he was in New York. I knew
                    very few people in New York, because our work was strictly down here. I went up
                    and did some filling in for Special Events people who were out on the road at
                    times. There was a period during—I think it was the spring of 1953, shortly
                    before I quit, it may have been '52, in which all the Special Events people in
                    New York were on the road, somewhere in the United States for special coverages.
                    The three of us Special Events officers who were assigned to the Washington
                    office, Bill McCrory and Bob Redeen and myself, we had each of us two weeks in
                    New York to fill in behind those people.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting experiences I had, I was doing interviews for a
                    half-hour show they were going to do on the Empire State Building, and among
                    others, I interviewed the president of the corporation, I interviewed the chief
                    window washer, I interviewed the engineer who designed and supervised the
                    construction of the television tower up on top. In fact, he took the VOA
                    engineer and me out onto the roof of the Empire State Building, the metal roof,
                    and I have acrophobia, normally, but I did not feel it then because the top of
                    the building was so big, and the wind was blowing so hard, that you didn't feel
                    that you were going to plunge off; you were just looking out.</p>

                <p>In interviewing the chief window washer in the office of the president of the
                    corporation, I asked about any memorable experiences he had had. He noted that
                    he never would forget the time when this body came hurtling by him as he was on
                    the 17th floor or something. [Laughter] And the corporation president, in a
                    panic, was giving a signal to cut, cut, cut, cut! We excised that from the
                    tape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't recall seeing any large gorillas on the
                        top?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: No. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure there are many more, but shall we proceed to the
                        post-August 1, 1953 part of your career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Interlude As Graduate Student</p>
                <p>GROCE: Well, it stopped being a career at that point, and I became a student at
                    Berkeley again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. So pick up from there, please. How long did you
                        stay at Berkeley?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Well, actually, I went out not seeking to go to Berkeley, but to look for
                    a job. When I was unsuccessful at finding a job in the San Francisco Bay area, I
                    concluded that I'd go back and get a master's in international relations,
                    because I was interested in getting back into international affairs. I went to
                    school, again, in late '53 and stayed until early '55.</p>
                <p>In the summer of '54, I took the State Department Foreign Service exam in San
                    Francisco, at a time when it was still three and a half days you had to go
                    through it. To my utter amazement, I passed it, but before I could come back to
                    take the orals and the physical, I was offered a job to return to the Voice of
                    America, which I accepted, and came back in February of '55.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Reemployment at VOA—Now in Washington</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>GROCE: By that time, the broadcast operation had moved from New York to
                    Washington. John Hogan had been the acting chief of the English operation in the
                    closing days in New York, and he knew my work from the penthouse days, and he
                    wanted to get me back in if he could. I was very glad to come back to the Voice.
                    I was a writer, broadcaster, editor, whatever.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Origination of “Music USA,” Long Popular Worldwide Jazz Music Program</p>
                <p>GROCE: Within a matter of a few months of my return, Music USA, the wonderful
                    jazz program done for many years now by Willis Conover; in the beginning done by
                    Ray Michael during the week, and Willis on weekends, then Ray Michael on
                    weekends, and Willis during the week. I don't know whether because John Wiggin,
                    who had conceived the program, realized that Willis knew a lot more about jazz
                    than Ray Michael did, but the idea of putting Music USA on had been to reach a
                    youth audience in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe without being blatant
                    about it or admitting it, and to talk about broadcasting to “Europe” as a whole,
                    and especially northern Europe, Scandinavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think almost everyone would have to concede that Music
                        USA has been one of the most spectacular successes of American radio. I'm
                        interested in hearing you say that the idea was conceived by John
                        Wiggin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Yes. He was the papa of Music USA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that a lot of people have taken credit, but I'm
                        glad to hear it was John. John was a wonderful guy, a pretty good musician
                        on his own.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Whether John is the person who conceived of this as a means of reaching a
                    youthful audience in the Soviet Union, I'm not sure. But he conceived of it as a
                    program concept, and maybe somebody else decided that this would be useful for
                    this particular purpose.</p>
                <p>“Music USA” - Means of Reaching Youth in USSR</p>
                <p>But after this had seemed to be successful in the early days, Barry Zorthian, who
                    was program manager, concluded that we ought to have a feature program to go
                    along with Music USA to reach the same East European-Soviet audience, those
                    people who understood the English language.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>So a number of us were asked to come up with proposals for the program, one hour
                    a day, preceding Music USA, which was then two hours a day. So I wrote up a
                    considerable plan, proposed a title for the show, proposed varying formats for
                    the show, and I was very pleased that most of my ideas were accepted, my title
                    was accepted, the format was accepted. The problem was we didn't have enough
                    people to do this ambitious one-hour-a-day program. It really required a massive
                    amount of work.</p>
                <p>When it was concluded that this was the way we were going to go, I was assigned
                    the responsibility of “coordinating” the program. It was not called editor; it
                    was not called producer. I had to supervise the writer, the editor, the
                    producer, and all the people who put the thing together. But basically, I did
                    most of the work myself.</p>
                <p>After two weeks on the air, I wrote a memorandum to my boss, who sent it on to
                    Barry Zorthian. My boss was Bill Rainey, who had been brought in as a political
                    appointee. He was in retirement from NBC, and then had joined the National
                    Association of Manufacturers in their public information office to handle radio,
                    and then he came out of that job into the VOA to do public service for his
                    country. He was a dear, sweet man, but utterly ineffectual in that role. But he
                    passed my memo on to Barry Zorthian, and to this day I have this memo I got back
                    with Zorthian's scrawl across the bottom, “Excellent memo. Let's discuss.” And
                    to this day, we've never discussed it. [Laughter] Because I was talking about
                    the number of people we needed and the requirements for program material. So I
                    have to kid Barry about that.</p>
                <p>Director George V. Allen's Desire for Expanded English Language Broadcasting</p>
                <p>But that went on from October of 1955 until the summer of 1958, when the Marines
                    went into Lebanon. At that time, George Allen, who was then the director of the
                    agency, and was on the record in the public prints with a proposal that we have
                    broadcasts in nothing but English. His reasoning? Because people who are
                    subjected to a foreign language broadcast are automatically going to suspect
                    that you are targeting it for them, you're propagandizing them, you've created a
                    thing that is designed to twist the facts and to change the situation as far as
                    their reception is concerned. He was a great believer in English broadcasting,
                    but he had not, because of budget constraints, been able to expand the English
                    broadcasting. We were doing six half-hours a day to different regions of the
                    world at that time.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, because of the emergency on the ground in the Middle East, he threw us
                    on the air 24 hours a day in English. Well, with the size staff we had, we had
                    to reorganize ourselves immediately and quickly. Three of us became shift
                    supervisors, and we alternated every week. One week we'd be on from 8:00 a.m. to
                    4:00 p.m. The next week we'd be on from 4:00 p.m. to midnight, the next week
                    from midnight 'til 8:00 a.m. All of us were going crazy with this sudden shift
                    in the clock in our bodies. But this went on for weeks, and finally, Allen
                    concluded that this ought to be kept—not to 24 hours, but heavily expanded
                    English.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>When the crisis then calmed down in the Middle East, we had a base from which to
                    move into a new schedule, but the new schedule clearly would not allow for a
                    one-hour-a-day program of this complex nature that we'd had before. We had to
                    simplify very heavily in order to turn out this much material.</p>
                <p>Panorama USA served its purpose for three years or so, almost three years, in the
                    '50s, and then it died.</p>
                <p>Willis Conover: The Star of “Music USA”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave this area, can you recall, Cliff, who
                        discovered Willis Conover? He'd been an announcer on a local station in
                        Washington, but who was it who tapped him and talked him into it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: I knew Willis Conover. I didn't know him personally, but I had been to
                    jazz concerts here when I was an intern. We used to go out to the old Uline
                    Arena up in northeast Washington and to other places. Of course, in those days,
                    Washington was still heavily segregated. I'll never forget that the day I first
                    met Willis Conover, to shake his hand, to say, “I'm Cliff Groce, and I know who
                    you are,” was the same day that I met Dean Acheson, the Secretary of State. Our
                    entire intern group had been welcomed by Acheson in his office on February 6,
                    1951. And that night, my wife and I went out to Lewis and Alex's, a club on U
                    Street, because George Shearing was playing there with his trio. Just after
                    11:00 o'clock, in came Willis Conover, having finished his 10:00 to 11:00 show
                    on WWDC, and the only available seat was on a banquette next to me, a little
                    two-by-four table. He sat down, and I immediately recognized him and greeted
                    him. That was the first time that I met Willis Conover, but that was before he
                    ever showed up at the Voice of America.</p>
                <p>From what I've heard through the years, I think it was John Wiggin who knew the
                    guy and knew of his work. And then after he came to VOA on a weekend basis, he
                    got it turned around so he'd be the regular host.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it should be recorded that Willis, over the years,
                        has never been a regular employee of the United States Information
                        Agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain how that works and how it is as of
                        today, as far as you know.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>GROCE: That's right. I think he may be regretting it at this point, because he's
                    had a lot of health problems and he's had no sick leave, and he's got no
                    retirement. But Willis has always wanted to maintain an independent position. He
                    felt that by retaining his independence and maintaining a contractual
                    relationship with the government of the United States, that this enabled him to
                    do things, especially with foreign peoples, especially in eastern Europe, that
                    he, as a government employee, would simply not be able to do, or certainly not
                    be able to do gracefully. Furthermore, it would enable him to fit into the
                    musical scene in this country without the onus of being a government employee, a
                    bureaucrat. So he chose this path.</p>
                <p>Now, the fact has also been that through the years the VOA and the agency have
                    been particularly generous in the contractual arrangements with Willis. Because
                    he had an abode in New York as well as in Washington, he was given money to
                    travel between the two cities, an allotment for that purpose. He was able to do
                    a number of things that an employee couldn't do. Certainly, his experiences in
                    eastern Europe, I think, are among the most valuable things that this agency's
                    ever had going for it.</p>
                <p>Birth, Nature and Purpose of Special English</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the English. It was about this time, was it not,
                        that Special English assumed importance at the Voice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Special English came in 1959. The study of the possibility of something
                    like this was going on when I was still here in '58, before I went to Munich in
                    the spring of '59, but it hadn't yet got on the air. A number of professors of
                    English as a Second Language, of linguistics, various professors around the
                    United States had been consulted, most of whom had thrown up their hands and
                    said, “This is not realistic. This is not the way to teach English.” Was this
                    Henry Loomis' idea?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I arrived at the Voice as deputy director in September
                        1959. At that time, it was just getting to be a very hot issue. Henry was
                        100% behind it, and it was one of the enthusiasms throughout the Voice. I
                        don't know if any one individual can take credit for it. A number of people
                        participated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: The person who developed it, finally, who got it onto the air was Dick
                    Borden. Because all these professors were very discouraging in terms of what
                    they thought would work and what they thought would not work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The difference, basically, as I recall, was that the
                        professors thought that we planned this as a way to teach English, but we
                        looked upon it as a means of communication.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>GROCE: Exactly!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there were two different approaches.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: But it was concluded that Basic English, which is a 750-word vocabulary,
                    was too limited, and yet we wanted something that could be simple enough, clear
                    enough, slow enough, so that a person who was learning English in an academic
                    context could follow the thing and ultimately improve his or her English so that
                    they could be able to listen to the regular English broadcasts. We have a lot of
                    evidence that this has, in fact, been the case. A lot of people have graduated
                    to regular English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's certainly proved itself over the years, hasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Oh, absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it's going on today.</hi>

                <p>GROCE: It may be up to 1,500 now. It was about 1,300 when I left.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The “Forum” Program</p>
                <p>GROCE: Yes. In 1959 or maybe it was late '58, Henry Loomis, Director of VOA, or
                    somebody conceived of a program, a series of lectures about major areas of study
                    in the United States—medicine, law, philosophy, literature, and so on, it may
                    have been Ted Wertime's idea to get this thing started. Henry gave him credit
                    for it. Loomis put Forum on the air, and the guy that was brought in—it was not
                    Wertime, but I forget the guy's name who started the series.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>GROCE: Walter Nichols. He knew nothing about radio, and so I held his hand and
                    put him through the whole process, and I worked with him. The first series was
                    about medicine in the United States. Each of these series had an outside
                    coordinator who was an expert in the field. We got a guy from Walter Reed
                    [Hospital] to coordinate the series on medicine. Each lecture would be on a
                    specialization of the broad field. That program, which I never thought was a
                    radio program—lectures on the air are really hard to take—I thought it should
                    have been reconstituted, reformatted from the very beginning, but the written
                    materials that grew out of those lectures were used by universities in other
                    parts of the world with great success. In fact, the medical series I mentioned
                    was used by the faculty of the University of the Philippines. We got word on
                    that from USIS Manila. And there were a number of such cases. Professors of
                    American literature would use some of our hardbound books or softbound books on
                    American literature. That was a very interesting development we had. Special
                    English and Forum were both out of that '59 period.</p>
                <p>1958: Munich Radio is Changed From Direct Program Origination and Broadcasting to
                    a Program Center</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to turn to Munich now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you happen to go to Munich?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: I applied for the job. [Laughter] And Barry Zorthian picked me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain what we had in Munich at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: The Munich operation of the Voice had, since 1951 or '52, been a radio
                    center. It was a forward outpost of the Voice of America, actually broadcasting,
                    originating programs to be broadcast into Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union a
                    la Radio Free Europe, which was also created about the same time by the US
                    Government.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>There was a newsroom established over there, there was a policy office, policy
                    mechanism. But in 1958, at the time John Albert was assigned over there and at
                    the time Jerry Donohue was assigned over there, a change occurred. I don't know
                    whether the change was strictly for budget reasons or because of some of the
                    problems that had developed in the political involvements of some of the staff
                    in the Munich operation and their opposition to some of the instructions and
                    guidance they'd been getting from Washington and, worse, in some cases, their
                    actual subversion of such guidance. In any case, it was decided and decreed that
                    all original broadcasting would be done from Washington. What had been a
                    so-called radio center in Munich would become a program center in Munich,
                    recording program materials for sending back by tape in the pouch to Washington
                    for rebroadcast in the languages and in English.</p>
                <p>So by the time I arrived there in the spring of 1959, we were covering
                    international conferences, covering disarmament talks, covering international
                    organizations headquartered in Geneva or Vienna or wherever. We would go from
                    Munich to Berlin or to Geneva or to Paris or to London, but the center, the
                    focal point was Munich, partly for the historical reasons of the existence of
                    the facilities there, the office space, and the people with the expertise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What transmitters were being used at that time from
                        Munich, do you recall? Were these German transmitters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: These were the old SCODA transmitters which the Germans had seized from
                    the Czechs in '38. Some of them are still broadcasting today. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm afraid so. So when you arrived, what was your
                        job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: I was called a program officer, but I was made the senior editor, in
                    effect. I would edit the work that other people did. I also did a lot of writing
                    myself.</p>
                <p>In converting it from a radio center to a program center, a number of the people
                    who stayed on there had been connected with foreign language operations, and had
                    done relatively little writing in the English language, certainly in broadcast
                    terms, short sentences. So one of my chief responsibilities in the early days
                    was to teach these people to write standard radio English.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget one of the first scripts I got from one of the foreign language
                    broadcasters, who had been an eminent journalist in his own right for many, many
                    years, including in the English language. The first script of his I saw, the
                    second or third sentence was a page long. You'd think it was a novel by Thomas
                    Mann! I had to sit down with this gentleman and go through it very carefully,
                    line by line, and we made a script out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Albert was in charge of the Munich operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: John Albert was in charge of the Munich operation when I arrived. John
                    Albert is probably the single most politically sensitive—fingertip
                    sensitive—person I've ever known. The man had an almost uncanny ability to sense
                    moods, to sense trends, to sense what was going to happen next. It was really a
                    fascinating thing to watch and to try to learn from him, although I'm afraid
                    some of that can't be learned; it's almost intuitive.</p>
                <p>When I arrived, John came back from Geneva, where he, and Jerry Donohue and Ed
                    Brown were covering a conference at the time. He came back just to greet me and
                    went right back that weekend.</p>
                <p>I was then, in effect, in charge of at least the program side of the Munich
                    operation. Al Julia, his deputy, was in charge of running the whole shebang. But
                    I would be on the phone to our people in Geneva every day, because they'd feed a
                    spot in the afternoon for transmission back to Washington. On some occasions,
                    such as this, we would be feeding Washington rather than sending it in by tape
                    when it was obviously a topical event that had to be covered that day. This was
                    the beginning, in effect, of what became the bureau, which is constantly feeding
                    back to Washington.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget one day there was a grammatical error in a spot that had been
                    fed up from Geneva. I said, “There's a grammatical error here.”</p>
                <p>John Albert got on at the other end and screamed at me, and said, “Damn it, we
                    know it's a grammatical error! It had to be written that way because otherwise
                    we would be acknowledging the legitimacy of the East German Government!”
                    [Laughter] This was at the time of the arguments over the shape of the
                    table—remember that discussion?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: So I backed off quickly, but I had the feeling I'd never get along with
                    this guy, I'd never be able to work with John Albert, because he was such a
                    tyrant, seemingly. Although I had been told by people who worked in his office
                    in Washington before I went over there that he was really a pussycat beneath all
                    that bluster. And he turned out to be really one of the finest bosses I've ever
                    had.</p>
                <p>It was a very interesting series of events and of coverages. During that period,
                    I learned that I could collaborate with somebody. As a reporter or writer, I had
                    always operated strictly alone, but there I met the man that I could really
                    collaborate with—Jerry Donohue. I'd be at the typewriter, and he'd be at my
                    shoulder, and it was as though these two minds were funneling in together into
                    that typewriter. It was just incredible. We really thought right together.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you stay in Munich, Cliff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you want to stay longer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Return to VOA: Deputy Chief, Program Branch,English Language Division</p>
                <p>GROCE: I fully expected to stay longer, but my mother became very ill, and we had
                    two little children, and I was very much afraid that if I didn't get the kids
                    back close to Grandma or get back closer to her myself, because of her
                    condition, that it would be too late. So with John's permission, I wrote to
                    Barry Zorthian and explained the situation. He was very understanding and said
                    I'd certainly have a job when I got back to VOA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Just as I got back, the baton was being passed from Barry Zorthian, who
                    was going to India, to Alex Klieforth, who was coming back from Berlin, where he
                    was director of RIAS (Radio in the Allied Section) at the time. Alex offered me
                    one of two jobs. He was creating a new job in charge of correspondents overseas,
                    which we were then beginning to send out. That was the very beginning of the
                    correspondent corps. The other was to be in the English broadcasting operation
                    as the deputy chief of the program branch.</p>
                <p>I decided that while I was very interested in the work of correspondents and what
                    I might be able to bring to that based on my own experience in Europe, I chose
                    the other job because of its centrality in programming matters, not just the
                    news side, but the feature side, commentary side, everything else. That's where
                    I wound up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the chief at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: At that time a gentleman was brought in from NBC Schenectady named Donn
                    Chown, who is now a member of the USIA Alumni Association.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Whom I see at the luncheons.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major developments in that area while you
                        were there, would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Turf Battles Between Program Units</p>
                <p>GROCE: There was a sort of turf battle after a while. When John Albert came back
                    a year later, in '62, from Munich, and took over the Central Program Services
                    Division, he, because of his long association and friendship with Alex
                    Klieforth, wanted to get several of the functions that were then in the English
                    operation transferred over to the Central Program Services. We in the English
                    operation, of course, resisted this strongly. He did get the feature operation
                    taken out of English and assigned to his shop. But shortly thereafter, it was
                    put back in English, and a feature adaptations unit was set up in his shop
                    instead, to take feature materials written for English broadcast, to be
                    simplified and streamlined for distribution to the language services for their
                    use. Because it is easier to simplify something that is a little more complex or
                    written for English broadcast than to try to take something that is written
                    neutrally and improve it with tapes and actualities on the one hand, and
                    simplified in the other direction. So that was what happened.</p>
                <p>Before that, in '61, even though I was assigned to English, I was borrowed by
                    Central Program Services, of which Len Reed was in charge, to do documentaries.
                    I did a series on the specialized agencies of the United Nations, called “Beyond
                    Politics.” I did a half-hour documentary on the death of Dag Hammarskjold and
                    its meaning for the UN. I did a half-hour documentary on the desegregation of
                    the public schools in Dallas, Texas. There were several very interesting major
                    programs that I worked on.</p>
                <p>New Show: The “Have You Been Told” Program Beamed to USSR Ed Murrow Spices Up
                    First Broadcast</p>
                <p>I was assigned the responsibility to do the great mass transmitter effort in
                    November of 1961, shortly after the Soviets resumed atmospheric testing, called
                    “Have You Been Told?” in which we were telling the Soviet listeners what their
                    government had failed to tell them. That was an interesting experience. I wrote
                    the thing very carefully. I tried to keep it as straightforward and deadpan as
                    possible, while still painting dramatic elements. Len Reed, who was then the
                    chief, as I mentioned, took it uptown. We were supposed to record it on Friday
                    afternoon for broadcast Saturday afternoon to the Soviet Union. The English
                    version would be run at 1:00 o'clock, and the Russian version would be run at
                    2:00 o'clock our time. So Len Reed took it up to show Ed Murrow at noon on
                    Friday. Everybody who had anything to do with it in VOA thought it was fine.
                    Murrow didn't like it. Murrow didn't find it dramatic enough. He said, “Juice it
                    up some, really hit them.”</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>So Len Reed came back. We had to postpone the recording of the thing till the
                    next morning, and Ed Gordon and I took typewriters into Len Reed's office. We
                    were really under a deadline. I took my name off the thing because I didn't want
                    credit for it. Each of us took a third of the show. Ed Gordon found an
                    absolutely horrific headline from Al Gomhoureya in Cairo about the poisoning of
                    the atmosphere and we're all going to die. It was really gruesome, really way
                    beyond the realities, but it made a sensational opening for the show. I got with
                    the producer and we started going through sound effects, so we'd mention the
                    names of all the sites of the tests, Novaya Zemlya, and we'd put an
                    explosion—BOOM!—Irkutsk—BOOM! [Laughter] We almost hammed it up. It was almost a
                    spoof, but he liked it. So we recorded the next morning at 7:00 o'clock. It ran
                    that afternoon.</p>
                <p>Monday, there came a message from the embassy in Moscow saying, “While the
                    program was quite satisfactory, for a Soviet audience it would have been better

                <p>Murrow's Two Deputies Were a Trial for VOA</p>
                <p>GROCE: I would like to make one little observation, since we talked about Ed
                    Murrow. Ed Murrow was always one—and still is—of my great journalistic heroes.
                    But as far as VOA was concerned, the Murrow era, given his two deputies, was the
                    most unfortunate period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of Don Wilson and Tom Sorensen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Don Wilson, as a friend of Bobby Kennedy's, and Tom Sorensen, the brother
                    of Ted Sorensen in the White House, had a great deal of influence within the
                    administration and within the agency, clearly. This was the only time in my
                    entire memory of my days with the Voice of America that we received written
                    instructions on how to play the news, “Accentuate the positive and eliminate the
                    negative, don't mess with Mr. In-between.” It wasn't signed by Ed Murrow, it was
                    signed by Tom Sorensen, his policy and plans deputy. It was unbelievable to see
                    such a thing in print, especially following on your success and Henry's success
                    in getting a Charter for the Voice of America, because it gave the lie to that
                    Charter. I have always wondered to what extent Murrow knew about, approved the
                    issuance of that instruction to the Voice of America. Murrow was sandbagged on
                    many occasions, and he was between the upper and the nether millstones all the
                    time with these two guys.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I'll never forget one time we were doing a series of programs, which is still on
                    the air, “Issues in the News,” which Bill McCrory had started back in '58, using
                    outside journalists to give their own views of developments that week in the
                    news. These were eminent people, like Bill Stringer, who was the bureau chief of
                    the Christian Science Monitor; Pete Lisagor of the Chicago Daily News; Marquis
                    Childs, the syndicated columnist; and Charles Cordry—really eminent journalists.
                    Stringer was the regular moderator of the program. That's when we still had a
                    regular moderator.</p>
                <p>The agency had put out a guidance saying that because of current controversy with
                    Canada about American nuclear weapons on Canadian soil, no media output would
                    talk about American nuclear weapons on Canadian soil. But it happened to be the
                    big controversial story of the week, and we never told these people what they
                    could talk about. Murrow killed the program when he found out the subject, so we
                    had to fill with some fluff or whatever in lieu of “Issues in the News” that
                    week.</p>
                <p>Obviously, Bill McCrory, who did the program, had to inform Bill Stringer that
                    his program had been canceled. Stringer was livid, and he called Murrow and
                    insisted on lunch, and he said if this were done again, he would have to cease
                    all relationship with the program and with the Voice of America. He just wanted
                    no part of this kind of an operation, because it was made clear that these
                    people were giving their own views. So Murrow backed down. What we got was a new
                    charter, in effect—it was a memorandum—but we called it the Issues Charter,
                    because it said there would be no interference in the exercise of the
                    journalists' freedom to say what they wanted to on any subject.</p>

                <p>VOA During the Cuban Missile Crisis - 1962</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>GROCE: Of course, the Cuban Missile Crisis stands out very prominently. I've
                    never worked so hard in my life as I did that week, as a lot of other people
                    did, too, because clearly, everything had to be very carefully handled. Burnett
                    Anderson was assigned to VOA to sit in the newsroom, from the policy and plans
                    office, and he was obviously very uncomfortable in this censor role, which is
                    what it amounted to. John Albert wrote a memo after that week, which is one of
                    the strongest things I have ever read in my life, in which he compared our
                    experience of the previous week to Goebbel's operation. John was certainly not
                    one of these flaming news-at-any-cost people; a very reasonable man and a very
                    positive man. I wish I had a copy today of that memo he wrote.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To whom did he write it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: I think he wrote it to the director.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be Henry Loomis at that time still.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Yes, it would have been Henry. I meant to ask Henry about that, in fact,
                    when I interviewed him, but it slipped by. That was a very, very crucial period,
                    of course. Henry Loomis has described the setting up of the network of 23
                    private radio stations and sending the AT&amp;T people in to jigger the boards
                    in the stations, saying they were making an adjustment. And when the White House
                    called the presidents and owners of the stations, and put Henry on to answer
                    their questions and he was asked, “How do we do this?” he says, “It's already
                    done. Just flip the switch here.” [Laughter]</p>

                    until I moved to the front office, until I moved to the program office as deputy

                </p>
                <p>GROCE: I was sitting in my office with the strowger on, listening to the line
                    that was to carry the President's speech in Dallas, which we were going to carry
                    live.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain, Cliff, what a strowger is, for the

                </p>
                <p>GROCE: A strowger is a loudspeaker system that is able to bring in material from
                    a variety of sound sources—radio stations, television stations, the White House,
                    the State Department, the congressional committee rooms, the radio and TV
                    galleries on both sides of the Hill, major hotel ballrooms—any place that is
                    likely to be the site of a major event. And it comes in and then can be punched
                    up or dialed up by a broadcaster in any part of the organization.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you. Back to the Kennedy assassination.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: I was listening to these two announcers sitting there in a station in
                    Dallas, because we were taking the feed from this station. We didn't have
                    anybody traveling with the President at that time. They were just sitting there
                    talking to each other casually, and then I hear one of them say, “There's word
                    that the President's been shot.” Of course, I perked up my ears. We were on the
                    air with Special English at that time, at 2:00 o'clock.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Well, suddenly, all hell broke loose in Dallas, and you could hear these voices,
                    people talking, and the word came that he was on his way to the hospital. So I
                    got Bill McCrory, who was always our number one anchor for special broadcasts,
                    and Bob Lodge, who was working with Bill at the time in the Special Projects
                    office, and got them into the studio. We interrupted the Special English
                    broadcast, explained why, and came on with a special program. And sure enough,
                    then had to reveal the fact that the President had been killed.</p>
                <p>Then we went on the air to stay. Of course, other language broadcasts were
                    expanded, too, but English was on the air worldwide from that time until the
                    following Wednesday after Johnson's speech to the Congress on Capitol Hill,
                    straight through, worldwide, throughout the whole period. We covered everything
                    that was happening. We deployed people all over this town. The funeral itself,
                    the parade, cortege was covered all the way out to Arlington. Of course, we were
                    all emotionally involved ourselves, because whatever our politics, this was the
                    President, and this was a very traumatic period in our history. Yet everybody
                    had to keep doing his professional best, and it was really very hard for a lot
                    of people a lot of the time. I was very proud of our performance in that period.
                    In fact, people depended on us for the word. We know that BBC didn't announce
                    the death of John Kennedy until they heard it on the Voice of America, because
                    they could confirm it that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me add a footnote here that supports all that. The day
                        that Kennedy was assassinated, I was in Korat, in northeast Thailand,
                        visiting our post there. I had always carried a short-wave radio with me,
                        and when I awakened in a Chinese hotel at 7:00 a.m., I tuned in first thing
                        to VOA English, and there I learned about the assassination. The coverage
                        was superb, and you just couldn't have asked for more professionalism than
                        the Voice gave us then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>On the way back to Bangkok, driving back, every Thai Government office had the
                    flag at half-staff, and I inquired along the way how they heard about it. “VOA.”
                    “VOA.” “VOA.” Everyplace we'd go!</p>
                <p>GROCE: Glad to hear it.</p>

                    responsibility for central output—newsroom, News and Current Affairs. I was
                    basically responsible for the language service broadcasts and English.
                    Obviously, it was not cut-and-dried, because he got involved a lot with other
                    programs, too, but one of my responsibilities was to set up, organize, and run
                    the program reviews of all the language services. I took on the responsibilities
                    for the budget. I took on a lot of the personnel responsibilities. I was sort of
                    the administrative manager along with the program.</p>

                <p>GROCE: There were a number of colorful characters in various language services.
                    The language services, rightly or wrongly, fortunately or unfortunately, were
                    never given the chance to shine that they should have had, in my opinion. There
                    was such fear of people going off on their own to make their own political
                    points, that regulations were very strict most of the time that I was there. The
                    news was provided by the newsroom, and you had to use these things in this order
                    or get special permission for exceptions. You had to carry the commentary of the
                    day or the analysis of the day or the editorial of the day, whatever it was
                    called at any given time. A lot less leeway was given to them in terms of
                    creating their own programs, and this is what I tried to fight the whole time I
                    was in there. I've always contended that you can't put the same program on to
                    the Thais and the Poles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any instance in which a language service
                        tried to make political points in violation of, say, overall US policy? Was
                        there something that happened that caused these restrictions to be put in
                        place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: If there was, I can't recall it. I don't know about it myself. I think it
                    was just a fear that it might happen, because people did assert themselves at
                    meetings, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We did have, at that time, the monitoring by Voice
                        personnel of the languages, which is long gone now, I guess. Was it set up
                        for that? Was that one of the reasons it was set up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>GROCE: Of course, it had been set up during the war for that reason, and it hung
                    on for many, many years, quite beyond its useful life, I thought, because it
                    didn't cover nearly all the languages. There were just two or three people left
                    there in the closing days of the monitoring service. I think it was a useful
                    thing for a wartime period and maybe during the depths of the Cold War in the
                    late Forties, early '50s. But certainly long before the head of it, Bob Mayer,
                    finally retired, it had outlived its usefulness. You hire the right people to do
                    the job and then you depend on them. Of course, you check them in program
                    reviews and you check them with some outside consultants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you think, as of the last you knew, the restrictions
                        on the language services work were too severe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Yes. There have been a number of cases in which, because of the sheer
                    creativity and liveliness and radio skills of some of the broadcasters, they've
                    done programs of a feature nature that were really superb. I remember back in
                    '76, the Spanish branch did a half-hour program on the Bicentennial, and it was
                    written by Luis Daniel Uncal and produced by Ramon Medina, the man who's now
                    wound up having to be retired because of his gold dealing in Peru, remember
                    reading about it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: But he's a fine producer. It was such an excellent program that the
                    division wanted to nominate it for the Director's Creativity Award, and the then
                    deputy director of VOA didn't want to do this because of the problems we had had
                    with Medina through the years—he was such a malcontent. But I took the position,
                    “For heaven's sake, from a managerial point of view, it's to our advantage to
                    give him an award in the field in which he really is good so he cannot say that
                    we're prejudiced against him on all counts.” So the guy relented, and he got the
                    award—the two of them got the award. Within three months, we had another run-in
                    with him, and we were able to say, “You see, we keep these categories quite
                    separate.”</p>
                <p>Problems of Mixing Foreign Service and Civil Service Personnel in VOA Jobs</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned, Cliff, that one of your duties was
                        personnel. At least a basic question must have troubled you from time to
                        time, and that was the mix of Foreign Service and Civil Service persons in
                        the Voice. Have you, after all these years, reached any basic conclusion as
                        to how that should be, or has it worked out well, or has it been a
                        disaster?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>GROCE: It's been a mixture. Some of the finest people who've ever worked at the
                    Voice of America, yourself included, were Foreign Service officers. Some of the
                    most disastrous people we've ever had at the Voice of America were Foreign
                    Service people, who probably did a very good job in field posts, but who never
                    understood or, in some cases, wanted to understand the differences between what
                    they do out there and what they had to do in the Washington headquarters of
                    VOA.</p>
                <p>Of course, this gets us into a bigger can of worms, if you want to get into
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's fundamental.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Back in '75, you will recall, the Stanton Commission came out with a
                    report recommending the reorganization of the information and cultural functions
                    of this government. They called for the policy support operations to be put back
                    in the Department of State from USIA, the cultural operations to be set up along
                    the lines of the British Council, and VOA to be an independent element. Henry
                    Loomis still disagrees strongly with that recommendation. But most of us in
                    leadership positions in the VOA, careerists in VOA, did approve of that,
                    certainly the separating out of VOA, although we recognized the dangers,
                    too.</p>
                <p>I helped draft the so-called declaration of independence that we did shortly
                    after the Charter was made into law, in which we wanted to get on the record
                    with anybody that would look and listen, the feelings of the career staff of VOA
                    about the institution. But one of the points I insisted on including in that
                    document was the desirability of retaining access to the corps of Foreign
                    Service people, but to be brought in on VOA's terms, rather than the Agency's
                    terms, because in so many instances in the past, it has been strictly at the
                    convenience of the Agency personnel office because somebody was scheduled for a
                    Washington assignment.</p>
                <p>I remember vividly one case—I shall not repeat the name—but an officer was
                    transferred back to Washington because his post had to be closed in an emergency
                    situation. He had no experience in the particular language or particular
                    country, but the Agency decided in its wisdom that he was going to be the head
                    of this major—I mean, very major—service of the Voice of America, as a reward
                    for what he had been through in this emergency situation in the country
                    concerned.</p>
                <p>The division chief and I went to the office of the then deputy director of the
                    Agency's, and joining him there was the area director for the area concerned and
                    the head of Foreign Service personnel. The division chief and I laid out our
                    arguments against this person's being assigned to this job, and the deputy
                    director of the Agency agreed that they would think it over. Of course, we knew
                    when we walked out of the room that the decision had been made before we walked
                    into the room. But at least we were able to get our position on the table.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>But the next day, I got a call from the deputy director himself, saying, “Having
                    thought over your very logical arguments, we've still concluded that the guy's
                    going to be sent there.” God, he was an absolute disaster in the job! He came in
                    with a chip on his shoulder, he came in lording it over the staff, many of whom
                    had been there for many, many years and were really crackerjack people, and it
                    was just an awful period for the three years he was there. Now, this is an
                    extreme case, but this is the kind of thing that has happened all too
                    frequently.</p>
                <p>In many cases, a Foreign Service officer is putting in his time. He can hardly
                    wait to get his next field assignment, so he sits there and does nothing. But I
                    was having to write their performance ratings, and I wasn't going to screw up
                    their careers, so I lied in many of the performance ratings. And yet you say a
                    man's excellent—I never gave anybody below excellent—and they'd still come back
                    to you and say, “Look, this is less than Outstanding! I'll be killed!”
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>So I think that the input of the Foreign Service is vital to an organization that
                    is broadcasting to foreign audiences, yes, I certainly do. But I think that a
                    way has got to be found to minimize the number of square pegs in round
                    holes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's been a basic issue for a long time and still is, I
                        assume, but I'm glad you discussed it, because for those who might read this
                        in years to come, don't think that you discovered this problem, because it's
                        been around ever since I can remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Did you enjoy that job? You had it for how long?</p>
                <p>GROCE: Thirteen years! [Laughter] So Charlie Wick was right. I was due out of
                    that job, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And during that time, you served under how many directors
                        of VOA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Let's see. When I moved in there, it was just after John Charles Daly had
                    quit, so Dick Cushing was acting director. Dick was acting until September of
                    '69, when Ken Giddens came. Giddens was director until '77.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Loomis was before this, then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Yes. Loomis was Deputy Director of the Agency when I moved into the job.
                    No, Loomis was still outside in '68, when I moved in there on an acting basis,
                    temporary, because Vestel was still alive. But then Loomis came in in January of
                    '69, and in the summer of '69, I was made officially the deputy.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>So Giddens was there until '77. Then Peter Straus was brought in by Jimmy Carter,
                    a very interesting man. Then he left and Mary Bitterman came in. So that was it.
                    And Conkling was the last one. Conkling came in in June of '81, and I left in
                    November of '81.</p>
                <p>Effect on VOA of Policy Changes Made by Changing Personnelat Top of USIA and
                    VOA</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I ask that not only for the record, but to see whether you
                        can trace the changes, any major policy changes that were introduced by any
                        of these persons or any general change in the basic relations with what we
                        then called “uptown.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Yes, very definitely. The growth and development of the correspondent
                    corps, the overseas correspondents, really flowered in the Giddens years, partly
                    because of developments overseas that really had to be covered by an institution
                    like our own, and partly because of the sheer importance of developing this kind
                    of expertise. But Circular Airgram 800 that went out from Shakespeare to the
                    field in the early '70s, was a compromise between those of us who wanted the
                    correspondents to have the same kind of independence to operate that the
                    commercial guys had on the news side, purely the news side, and those people who
                    think that the news is nothing but a diplomatic note in another guise. But the
                    crucial upshot of that Circular Airgram was that the ambassador is the final
                    authority, has the final responsibility for anything that a VOA correspondent
                    does. That correspondent could file the story even over the opposition of the
                    ambassador or the PAO acting for the ambassador, but the decision would then be
                    made in Washington, taking into account the fact that it was over the objection
                    of the embassy.</p>
                <p>This is the way it was when Peter Straus came in, and there had been a number of
                    very unfortunate situations under that system. Peter Straus, in the minds of a
                    lot of us at the time—because of remarks he made about the cost of the
                    correspondents corps, the fact that we had all this news through other
                    sources—he seemed to question the need for, the validity of, the legitimacy of a
                    correspondent corps for VOA. So a lot of us felt, rightly or wrongly, when he
                    decided to set up a study group to study the whole VOA correspondent mechanism
                    and operation, he was using this as a means of eliminating the correspondent
                    corps. He thought that any outsider would come to the conclusion that it wasn't
                    necessary. Now, we may have been absolutely wrong. This may have been utterly
                    unfair. He may have been just simply seeking information, which is what
                    happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>He hired Chalmers Roberts, the retired diplomatic correspondent with the
                    Washington Post, as the chairman. He got Pauline Frederick, who was with
                    National Public Radio at the time. Who else? I don't recall. It was called the
                    Roberts group. They came to the conclusion that the VOA did indeed need a
                    correspondent corps, that it was being well served by the correspondent corps,
                    that that corps should have greater independence from political people. And to
                    achieve this, I think they went too far in the separation itself, but the
                    correspondents would not carry official or diplomatic passports, only regular
                    passports; they would not have access to government commissaries or PXs
                    overseas; they would rent their own office space, their own apartments, operate
                    totally independently. That's what I think is going too far. But it has made an
                    enormous difference in the way they're able to operate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much of that report was accepted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: The whole thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was? The whole report? And that's the policy
                        today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Yes, sir.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of those things you mentioned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: All of those things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't know that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Yes, sir. I remember when Bob Chancellor in Johannesburg was elected by
                    his peers in the foreign press corps there as the president of the Foreign Press
                    Association in Johannesburg. People like this had always been respected for what
                    they did. Like Philomena Jurey at the White House, she's highly respected by her
                    colleagues, but she could never ask a question, and I think, as long as the
                    VOA's in the government, she shouldn't be able to ask a question. But there were
                    a number of other limitations on her relationship with the press office. And of
                    course, it's only in very recent years that we got the credentials on the
                    Hill.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But now looking back on it today, February 8, 1988, this
                        has been, overall, a plus or a minus, in your opinion, especially with
                        respect to correspondents overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: A great plus.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the fact that they don't have access to government
                        housing or the PX or all the things that go with it, you've been able to
                        attract good people to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Oh, yes. The problem has been with people with kids, mainly because of
                    costs. It costs the VOA a lot more money to support a correspondent who's having
                    to get his own apartment and pay for all the things that go to make up family
                    support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It doesn't go so far as to require the correspondent to
                        pay his own transportation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Oh, no. He still works for the Voice of America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's still working for the Voice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Oh, sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he has no responsibility to the PAO or the
                        ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there complaints from State about these
                        arrangements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: You'll always get complaints from the field about individual items. In
                    fact, this is one of the things that I'm sure led to my departure from VOA under
                    the circumstances that prevailed. In the months preceding my departure, after
                    the arrival of Conkling in 1981, I can't remember the specifics now, there were
                    several cases of complaints from the field about particular correspondent
                    reports. These people, being as new as they were, without the background and all
                    the struggles we'd been through to achieve this independence, you know, when you
                    get a rocket from an ambassador, people are impressed, understandably. They
                    should be. But there was such a little flurry of them there in this short period
                    that these people began to think, “Something's wrong with these guys. What are
                    they trying to do? Are they trying to stick it to us because we're the new
                    boys?”</p>
                <p>I'm surmising a lot of this, Jack. Don't hold me to it. But this was certainly
                    the impression one got.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>So then this is why, I'm sure, Mr. Wick is reported to have said he intended to
                    be the editor-in-chief of the Voice of America. He wanted to take over that
                    building for the Agency, and his office would then be the former fifth floor
                    office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. But it didn't work out
                    that way. They got the building across the street. At least he got close.</p>
                <p>But I think the mind set that was created by this flurry of complaints—then, of
                    course, you had the hiring of Nikolaides and the Nikolaides memo that got to the
                    Post and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain who he was and what that was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: I was gone by then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Identify him, if you will, please.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Phil Nikolaides, Phillip Nikolaides, I don't know what he did before. He
                    was a writer for—it's unfair for me to describe what he was before he joined the
                    Voice of America. Anyway, he had very firm ideas about what the Voice should be
                    doing as propagandists. He's the one who talked about “the sizzle, not the
                    steak.” He thought you had to really make an impression with what you did on the
                    air. He was very strongly anti-Communist, and he thought the way to talk to the
                    world from the United States about Communism was in a slanging fashion. When his
                    memo was made public, his memo to Conkling, it was so egregious in its
                    description of how we ought to be doing things that he had to be let go. It was
                    just too uncomfortable politically for the powers that were to try to maintain.
                    He was brought in as the head of policy, but he also wrote editorials.</p>
                <p>That's another interesting subject, the history of editorials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Through the years, the supplemental material to go beyond the news, talk
                    about subjects in the news, have been in a variety of forms and guises. Even as
                    far back as wartime, during the war years, in New York you had expressions of
                    policy on the air. They were called commentaries in those days because it was a
                    specific comment on a given issue. Then we went through a period in the '50s and
                    '60s in which you didn't do commentaries; you did analyses. You analyzed the
                    news. We had both at times. If you had a really important policy point you
                    wanted to make, then you put it in a commentary. Otherwise, you talked about
                    things.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Wasn't it in Henry's period when we talked about food for thought, that you put
                    things on the air to have the audience think about them and conclude that they
                    would come down on your side eventually, or at least closer to it? So this was
                    what the analyses were supposed to provide—food for thought. It never came to a
                    policy point, pushing a particular line; it was just an analysis.</p>
                <p>When Peter Straus came, I remember he said that he had to be able to go to his
                    friends on the Hill and say, “The American taxpayer is getting nine minutes a
                    week of the taxpayer's money's worth.” Of course, those of us at the Voice
                    thought they were getting a lot more than nine minutes a week of their money's
                    worth! [Laughter] But he wanted to have something official, so that's when we,
                    in effect, dropped the analyses and put on editorials. We opened every one with
                    a reference to the official position of the United States on Problem X, Issue Y,
                    and signed it off the same way.</p>
                <p>Well, that went on throughout that period, but when the current team came in,
                    they re-created the editorials, for some reason. Maybe something happened in the
                    meantime, but they wanted it tougher. They wanted it more affirmative. So at the
                    same time, some of them would be very strongly propagandistic, and others would
                    be on the Statue of Liberty, on Christmas, on things that had nothing to do with
                    US policy, and yet everyone wound up with this introduction about US policy.</p>
                <p>So this is an area of broadcasting from the United States to the world that, to
                    my mind, has never been satisfactorily resolved. Although when you had people
                    like Ronald J. Dunlavey and Harold Courlander writing commentary and analyses,
                    these are very fine people, they're very good writers, they're very good
                    thinkers, they certainly knew policy backwards and forwards, and they did a good
                    job whatever they turned out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cliff, picking up from where we were, I think you are
                        prepared to get into the events of 1981, is that correct? Would you like to
                        begin there, or would you like to review more of a previous period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Misunderstandings Leading to Groce's Departure from VOA</p>
                <p>GROCE: 1981 is okay. When Mr. Wick became the director in March or April or so,
                    Ken Giddens, of course, was a great propagandist for the VOA, within the
                    government and outside the government. He made some speeches at Rotary Clubs and
                    various places about the importance of the Voice and its need for money and
                    facilities and people. He got a lot of information for me that he'd been
                    familiar with before to provide to Mr. Wick for his briefings and to see to the
                    transmitter needs and so on.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>When Jim Conkling came in as director of VOA, a lot of people wondered why he was
                    picked, because he didn't seem to know very much about international
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What can you tell us about his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: He had been the president of Columbia Records. He was either the vice
                    president of Columbia Records and the president of Capitol Records, or vice
                    versa, I'm not sure which. I knew at the time, but I don't remember now. He had
                    been, also, a member of some kind of group that helped manage or oversee the
                    broadcast operations of the Mormon Church. His wife had been a member of the
                    King Sisters, the singing group. In fact, when she came to town before he did, I
                    took her on a tour of the place. I gave her a briefing. Then he came in, a peach
                    of a man, a very sweet man, a very nice man. But he never seemed to get a feel
                    for the organization.</p>
                <p>When people would come in from the outside to talk about some relationship
                    between the Voice and something in China, he seemed much more open with the
                    outsiders than he did with us insiders. I don't know whether he didn't trust us
                    or felt we didn't trust him or what, but at the time that I was there, he never
                    seemed to come to grips with the job quite yet.</p>
                <p>I said a while ago that we had a flurry of complaints in from the field about
                    things that we carried, correspondent reports, at least one of which we should
                    never have carried, in my opinion. But I guess it was against this background
                    that he felt so sensitive to any developments that might look politically
                    dangerous.</p>
                <p>The incident that I think led to my departure from the institution was a call
                    that I had. Every morning Conkling would go up for the director's meeting, which
                    was at 9:15, and he'd call me beforehand to see what he might need to bring up
                    there so he wouldn't get sandbagged or something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position at that time, once again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: At that time, I was acting program manager. So one morning he called and
                    said, “I want the names of the people who put the Soviet spokesman on the air
                    last night.” Of course, I knew nothing about this.</p>
                <p>As soon as he said that, the names of the people who put it on the air, I
                    thought, “Oh-oh, here we go.” So I said, “Well, Jim, I don't know whether you
                    realize that you're really opening a can of worms with this kind of
                    request.”</p>
                <p>And obviously he was sitting in Mr. Wick's office. He said, “I want those names!”
                    Very formal.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I said, “Okay, Jim, I'll get them for you, but I want to have nothing to do with
                    this. I'll get you the names, but I don't want to know the names.” I checked
                    into the situation immediately and found out what had been carried the night
                    before. I don't know whether some reaction had come from overseas or whether
                    somebody had heard it on the air here, on the strowger or whatever, but the
                    English program staff had picked up a quote from a Soviet embassy spokesman. It
                    had something to do with some negotiation between the United States and the
                    Soviet Union, and then it was followed by the President giving the American
                    position. So what we had done was to set up, in effect, a straw man, and let the
                    President knock it down, which is a valid technique. Then at another point, they
                    had used a quote from Arbatov, just a short one, again followed by the
                    President. But the fact that we'd carried any Soviet at all apparently is what
                    upset whomever.</p>
                <p>So I went to the acting chief of English, because Hal Banks was overseas, and his
                    deputy Woody Demitz was there. I said, “I want the names of the editors who put
                    the Soviets on the air last night. Put them in an envelope and give them to me.
                    I don't want to know who they are.” So he did.</p>
                <p>But every morning, Conkling spent the whole morning uptown, and he would come in
                    after lunch to VOA—practically every morning, not every morning. So this day he
                    came in about 2:00 o'clock. I saw him go by my door. I quickly followed him down
                    the hall to his office, and I handed him the envelope. I said, “Here are the
                    names.” But I said, “I don't think you realize, Jim, what you're getting into,
                    because all kinds of suspicions are aroused.” He had also asked for all the
                    English output for the 24 hours including that thing. I said, “Do you realize
                    what you're asking for?” He wanted it by 5:00 o'clock. I said, “It's impossible
                    to get it done by 5:00 o'clock.”</p>
                <p>“I want it by 5:00 o'clock!” Well, of course, you can't hide a thing like this.
                    Everybody in the division knows that you're having to transcribe all of the
                    output.</p>
                <p>So again, when he came in that afternoon, I said, “They're working on the
                    transcribing and I have the names, but I don't think you realize the
                    implications of this. There's no way to keep this quiet, and word is already all
                    over the house that people are being suspected of things.”</p>
                <p>And he said to me, “You really feel that strongly about the names?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes, I do.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, forget it.” He gave me back the envelope and just dismissed it
                    like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He still wanted the 24-hour output, though?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>GROCE: Yes. We got most of it by 5:00 o'clock; the rest of it went into the
                    evening. But he was so casual about this dismissal, and I just tore it up and
                    threw it away, and that was the last I heard of it.</p>
                <p>Then the newsroom put out a monthly or quarterly or whatever in-house publication
                    called Newsroom News, and Mark Willen was editing the thing. He was one of the
                    senior editors. He did an interview with Jim Conkling about the correspondent
                    reports and reactions to them and about this little hassle over the names and
                    the output. In the course of the interview, Conkling says to him, “Why, Cliff
                    Groce even suggested that this was a new McCarthyism.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you mentioned that word to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: No. I had mentioned in another memo quite separate from this a reference
                    to the early '50s. Apparently he put two and two together and came up with five
                    or six. But he just blurted this out, apparently. I've heard since that Willen
                    went back to him before he printed this thing and said, “Are you sure you want
                    to say all these things in a publication?” And he said, “Absolutely.”</p>
                <p>So then as soon as this got out—I mean, half the people in the newsroom are
                    married to people who are in commercial journalism! I had a call within hours
                    from Ferguson of the Baltimore Sun, because my name was in this
                    thing—”McCarthyism.” I was on the phone. I couldn't just refer him to the Public
                    Information Office. He had a quote there. This is direct. The Director of the
                    Voice of America has said this; I can't deny he said it. So I tried to explain
                    to him that the reference to McCarthy was in a completely different context and
                    the director had mixed it up. He said, “But he said it.”</p>
                <p>I said, “You're right. He said it, and I can't believe it. I'm just trying to get
                    you to understand it's not quite that way.”</p>
                <p>So he wrote, I thought, a reasonable piece that was in the Sun the next morning.
                    But again, we tried not to let Conkling get sandbagged, trapped, so we clipped
                    the thing and had it on his desk and called uptown to be sure he knew about it
                    before he went into the meeting with the director. Bill Haratunian read it to
                    him over the phone, as I recall.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, The New York Times picked it up, talked about a confrontation
                    between Conkling and me, in which Conkling backed down. There was no
                    confrontation at all, and certainly no backing down. But once one of these
                    stories takes hold, it takes on a life of its own.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>I think from that time on, this was the image that Charlie Wick had of me,
                    because then came the transfer to television. I was at the Christmas party in
                    John Hughes' office, who was the director of the Programs Bureau at the time,
                    about the 21st of December, and I'm standing, talking to Jack Crockett in the
                    middle of the room, people all around, and in comes Mr. Wick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was at the Voice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: No, this was up in the Bureau of Programs, in John Hughes' office. I was
                    already in the Television and Film Service by this time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you learn that you were going to Television?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: I was called in my Jim Conkling at a quarter to 4:00 in the afternoon and
                    handed a letter from Charlie Wick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Addressed to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Addressed to me, transferring me to be deputy director of the Television
                    and Film Service of USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any reason given?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Just that it was hoped that I would “enjoy this challenging new
                    assignment” or something like that, because television was the wave of the
                    future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No criticism of your performance or behavior in any
                        way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: No. See, I was a Senior Executive Service member, and in the Senior
                    Executive Service, they have to give you a job for which you are, on paper,
                    qualified. When I read this, I was just absolutely shattered, because the Voice
                    was my life. It's the only place I'd ever wanted to work in the United States
                    Government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So back to the Christmas party, then. Wick came in.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>GROCE: Wick came in, and he was shaking hands with people all around the room. He
                    came up to Jack and me, and he put his hand on my shoulder and he shook my hand,
                    and he said, “And I'm going to prove to you that this is not the beginning of a
                    new McCarthy period.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Mr. Wick, I never said that. I resent the reports having me say that,
                    and I refer you to Jim Conkling for confirmation.”</p>
                <p>And he went on. I said to Jack Crockett, “Well, you see where I stand.”</p>
                <p>He said, “A lot of people stand behind you.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the subject of McCarthyism come up again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: No, not that I ever saw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who replaced you at the Voice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Frank Scott.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had he been in the wings or on the payroll?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think they had arranged in advance for him to come
                        in and were trying to make room for him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: No. Conkling told me, when he was giving me this letter, that only a
                    handful of people would be affected. Because I had told him, “I understand that
                    a number of people are going to be let go or transferred.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Only a handful.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, that's at least five, isn't it?”</p>
                <p>But sure enough, Haratunian was already gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had Bill gone?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>GROCE: Bill had gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Retired or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: He was transferred uptown to the East Asia Bureau, I think. But then he
                    did retire shortly after that. Bernie Kamenske, of course, went with Cable News
                    Network; Alan Heil was moved into a different job out of News and Current
                    Affairs; Bill Read was moved out, he went up to the Agency's Telecommunications
                    office; Hal Banks was transferred to New York; Allan Baker retired, the head of
                    the Near East and South Asia Division for many years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You attribute much, if not all of this, Cliff, to the
                        incident you reported earlier?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: I think the incident I reported earlier was just the trigger, really, of a
                    climactic moment. I think it was going to happen in any case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that suggests that there had been some surveillance,
                        perhaps, of individuals and their performance, their attitudes and so
                        forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: No, I think they were simply determined to clean house, to have their own
                    people. The assumption seemed to be that anybody who had been there for any
                    length of time would not be adjustable, adaptable, to the new way of doing
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If that were the case, why did they make you number two at
                        television? That wasn't a throw-away job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Heavens, it was a wonderful job, and I think the happiest year I spent in
                    the Agency was that 14 months there!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you square that with the idea of shaking up the
                        Voice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Because it got me out of the Voice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but if you were of malicious intent, you could have
                        carried on at Television.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: I don't think there was suspicion of malicious intent.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they wanted you out of the Voice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Just as they wanted Kamenske. Heil is still at the Voice. In fact, he's in
                    my old job. They've reorganized again so that it's now the way it was. But they
                    got rid of a number of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on that experience, Cliff, do you find more
                        than traces of McCarthyism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: I think it's quite different. It's not looking for Communists. I mean,
                    those of us who had been transferred or moved about or whatever, forced to
                    retire, I don't think any of us have been suspected of being a Communist
                    sympathizer or a sucker for the Communist line or anything of that sort. I think
                    it's just that these people wanted to have people around them with whom they
                    could be comfortable, with whom they felt an ideological . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Possibly more sympathetic to the Reagan cause?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to TV in what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: 1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your boss there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: That was interesting, too, because my boss then was the deputy director of
                    television, but he was acting director, because the director had been
                    transferred overseas. Jim Perrin was the acting director when I went, who is now
                    deputy PAO in Paris. But Perrin did a very nice thing, the night that I was
                    given my walking papers and was told I was transferred to Television, that Sam
                    Courtney and Terry Catherman were coming in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what capacities were they coming in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Terry as deputy director, and Sam as deputy for programs. The title was
                    changed; he was second deputy. They arrived to be introduced the day I was given
                    the paper.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you had a happy year at television.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Acting Director of TV Service</p>
                <p>GROCE: But then within two months, Jim Perrin was transferred to the field, so I
                    was, after no preparation whatsoever, Acting Director of Television and Film for
                    months! I've got to say that was a very productive period. We turned out some
                    very fine stuff. I should say they turned out some very fine stuff. Whatever you
                    think of the program value or significance of “Let Poland Be Poland,” it was a
                    major accomplishment in purely technical production terms. I think Jock Shirley
                    did an absolutely superb managerial job in pulling all those strings
                    together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his job at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: He was the counselor of the Agency. Of course, he had this special
                    relationship with things Polish because of his service there. He really honchoed
                    that thing to a T. He was the focal figure for the Hollywood connections and the
                    New York connections and the State Department connections, FCC connections. He
                    really did a superb job. I got a nice letter from Charlie Wick from Rome,
                    thanking me for all of our hard work getting it on the air.</p>
                <p>I never felt really in charge at television, because I wasn't, in the first
                    place, prepared for it. In the second place, I was just waiting until a new
                    director came in, which didn't happen until the fall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Al Snyder, who is still the director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was an outsider or a career man?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: An outsider. He was the television coordinator for the Nixon White
                    House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to discuss more about your TV period there, or
                        do you want to go on to the next one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: That's probably fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in TV, Cliff, from approximately when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>GROCE: From November 30, 1981 to February 21, 1983.</p>
                <p>From TV to Press Services</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what happened? Did you get another letter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Yes, but I got a little warning before. Let's just say I got a
                    less-than-fully-satisfactory performance rating as a result, apparently, of a
                    memo I wrote to the director, which to this day I've never had explained, but I
                    was told the director was outraged by my memo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell us the subject of the memo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: It had to do with the TV Satellite File, a project that we were working
                    on, which was a very special favorite of the director's. We hadn't asked for
                    money. First we had asked just for permission to proceed to do a pilot program,
                    and we were going to use money from our own budget for this purpose. The
                    director had come back and said, “No, don't spend that money. It's got to be
                    cheaper than that.” Of course, all these memos went up and down through John
                    Hughes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whose position at that time was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: First, he was the head of Programs when the project first started, then he
                    moved over to Broadcasting and was head of Broadcasting, and Television was
                    moved under him by the director, because he wanted John Hughes' supervision.</p>
                <p>So we went through several memos back and forth. After this succession of
                    memoranda up to the director's office and back, we were finally asked one day by
                    the counselor's office, Jock Shirley's office, to prepare a memo for the
                    director giving the status of this project.</p>
                <p>I was uptown at a meeting, and when I got back, a memo had been drafted by my
                    acting deputy, Jack DeViney, an old hand in Television, setting forth the status
                    of the thing. I read the thing and said, “Jack, this is too strong. We've got to
                    modify this. We've got to moderate it. It's got to be gentler. Where you say
                    'There must have been a misunderstanding,' I'd say, 'The impression may have
                    been created.' Let's put the onus on us and not on the director for the
                    misunderstanding.” This kind of thing. So we softened it considerably.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>I hand-carried it over to Broadcasting, told them it had to be in Jock Shirley's
                    office before 1:00 o'clock, and they assured me it would be.</p>
                <p>About 3:30 that afternoon, we got a call from uptown—”Where's that memo?”</p>
                <p>I said, “My God, it was in the hands of the people that were supposed to deliver
                    it before 1:00 o'clock.” It turns out that Frank Scott, who was the acting
                    director at the time, had just tossed it aside and gone to lunch, and he didn't
                    sign it until he got back. They finally found it in the routine mail, and they
                    rescued it and it went up.</p>
                <p>We were called back by Jock's office and told, “It's just right. Perfect.” So we
                    were relieved to hear that.</p>
                <p>Then the next morning, I was talking to Bob Earle, the director's assistant,
                    about another matter, and he just said, very calmly and casually, “Oh, by the
                    way, Cliff, the director received your memo and he's put the project on hold.”
                    Well, as soon as I heard that, I knew he must be unhappy. He wouldn't just hold
                    the project otherwise.</p>
                <p>Then Terry Catherman called me a day or so later for a meeting at the National
                    Gallery for lunch. He was then the acting director of broadcasting, because John
                    Hughes had just transferred to the State Department as the spokesman, Assistant
                    Secretary for Public Affairs. So Terry said to me, “The director was outraged by
                    your memo.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Why? How?”</p>
                <p>“I don't know, but he was outraged.”</p>
                <p>I had asked Bob Earle, “Can you tell me why he has put it on hold?”</p>
                <p>He said, “I'm sending you a memo.” Well, the memo turned out the next day to be a
                    buck slip with nothing but, “The director has put it on hold.” So to this day, I
                    have not received an explanation of why the director was outraged by that
                    memo.</p>
                <p>But in any case, I stayed on, kept doing my job, and Snyder came aboard in
                    September. I went back to being deputy. Then I got the
                    less-than-fully-satisfactory performance rating. Then I was summoned by Jim
                    Hackett, who was then the Associate Director for Management for the Agency, to a
                    discussion of my performance rating. In the course of our conversation, I
                    pointed out to him that I had not even met the new director of broadcasting, who
                    was supposed to be my boss. So he said, “Well, we'll have to do something about
                    that.”</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>So the next day, I had a call that I was going to meet with Ken Tomlinson, the
                    new director of Broadcasting, and Bill Carroll, the head of personnel for VOA,
                    for Broadcasting, and Al Snyder, in Tomlinson's office. So we had quite a
                    session, at the end of which Tomlinson told me I was staying as deputy director.
                    They were going to give me a new set of requirements, and six months from now,
                    we'd look back and see this period as an aberration. Well, I was dumbfounded,
                    because I thought for sure I was going to be canned at that meeting.</p>
                <p>Two weeks later, Hackett calls me and says, “A letter is on the way transferring
                    you from the Television Service to the Press and Publications Service.”</p>
                <p>I said, “This is very ironic, Jim, coming on the heels of what I was just told at
                    the meeting with the director of Broadcasting and the director of Television and
                    the director of Personnel.”</p>
                <p>He said, “The director has decided otherwise.” And that was it. So then I went to
                    Press and Publications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what capacity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Assistant director. Jim McGinley did not want a deputy, but they
                    re-created the old deputy job as assistant director, number two in Press and
                    Publications. Within a month or two, I was functioning as a full deputy for Jim.
                    Jim had just abolished that job. But when I was forced down his throat, he was
                    very, very gentlemanly and we got along beautifully. I had three very good
                    bosses at Press and Publications—Jim, first, and then Cliff Southard, and then
                    Mike Pistor, three very fine people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have special responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Yes. The job was created for me to be in charge of, ironically, the
                    computerized text editing operation. I knew nothing about computers. [Laughter]
                    But I learned fast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That lasted how long, Cliff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Until June 30, 1986, when I retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any highlights of events during that period at IPS that
                        you'd like to report? Any special problems with the front office?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>GROCE: My proudest achievement during that period, since I knew nothing about
                    computers—as I said, this was made my baby—was to establish this massive
                    computerized text editing process system in the new building, and when we moved
                    down from 1776 to 301 4th Street, we didn't miss a beat. We didn't miss a
                    Wireless File.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any further words with or from Mr. Wick
                        during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Never.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you had three good bosses there. Is this to be
                        interpreted as being another happy assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Oh, very. Oh, yes. In fact, realistically speaking, Jack, looking back, I
                    think I got out of VOA just in time. I think I got out of Television just in
                    time. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] Not many people can say that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: For the wrong reasons, I have Charlie Wick to thank, and certainly for a
                    much broadened view of the Agency and meeting an awful lot of wonderful
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a difficult question but, I think, possibly fair.
                        If you were to be able to redo your career with USIA, would you make any
                        changes in your assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: No, not a one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recommend the Agency to bright young people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that there has been, overall, a contribution
                        by the Agency to global objectives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Oh, of course I do! I'm convinced of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you feel that we should remain a separate Agency? You
                        don't favor the Roberts Report or Stanton Report?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Discussion of Whether VOA Should be Independent</p>
                <p>GROCE: I favor the Stanton Report. Yes, I do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: State again what the main points were of that report.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: As I recall it—and I haven't read it in a long time—but the proposal
                    was—and Barbara White was a defender of the thing, too. She wrote a very nice
                    piece in the USIA World, justifying it. But the Stanton Commission divided the
                    functions of the Agency and CU, as it was then, in the Department of State, into
                    three categories, three basic functional areas. One was cultural and educational
                    as in CU; one was information in support of policy, which would mean those
                    things like the Wireless File and magazines, other direct support media
                    activities, move those into something like the old IIA was in the Department of
                    State; and establish VOA as an independent entity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There would be no USIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: There would be no USIA left. Now, I have very mixed feelings about that
                    aspect of it. I think USIA, in many ways, as a separate agency, as an
                    independent agency, has been able to do a lot of things overseas that it perhaps
                    wasn't able to do when it was under the State Department, when the information
                    function was under the State Department before. Because while overseas the
                    officer is responsible to the ambassador, he is also responsible to USIA
                    headquarters in Washington.</p>
                <p>But again, as in the case of the relationship between VOA and the Agency, the
                    relationship between the USIA functional elements and the Department of State
                    depends a great deal on the personalities of the leaders involved. This is the
                    argument that I have with Henry Loomis. He contends that the Agency leadership
                    is needed as a buffer between VOA and the two big elements of foreign policy,
                    the White House and the State Department. Those of us who have experienced
                    through the years the relationship between VOA and USIA, except when people like
                    Henry Loomis are in charge at USIA, that we've needed more protection from our
                    betters than we have from the White House and the State Department. As I said
                    earlier, there are advantages and disadvantages to any of these arrangements or
                    rearrangements.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>To go back to the time that the creation of an International Communication Agency
                    was being planned, several of us from the Voice, including Ken Giddens, went to
                    see John Reinhardt before he was official. We laid out on the table our desires
                    for a greater degree of independence. He certainly wasn't, as his first official
                    act, going to give up a third of his organization. So before we left that
                    afternoon, I said to John Reinhardt, “John, if you can't bring yourself to go to
                    the extent that we have discussed here this afternoon, could you at least find a
                    way to elevate the role and position of the Director of the Voice of America
                    within the hierarchy of the Agency?” Because at that time, he was just another
                    assistant director, along with all the area offices and IPS and whatever, even
                    though he had this massive enterprise to manage. I said, “In terms of personnel
                    and administration, policy, there are various differences and there are great
                    responsibilities.”</p>
                <p>He didn't say yes or no, but lo and behold, when the new reformed ICA came out,
                    there were four associate directors, one of whom was the Director of VOA. So I
                    thought we had gained something in that thing, and, of course, eventually VOA
                    got its own personnel office, far bigger than is necessary, in my view, but we
                    got one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's now an associate director still, is it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Yes, the other three being Programs, Educational and Cultural Exchange,
                    and Management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a strange aberration, wasn't it, that ICA
                        business? I never knew whether that was imposed on Reinhardt by Jimmy Carter
                        or whether it was Reinhardt's idea. Do you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: I don't know, but whoever had the idea, I think the reason for the change
                    in name and shape was to try to make the people from CU feel that they were
                    equal. Because if you just moved CU into what was then USIA, then it would look
                    like they were just being absorbed into this great big organization, which is,
                    of course, what happened, but at least the facade and the fact that they became
                    an Associate Directorate gave a prestige to the unit that was roughly comparable
                    to what they had in the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember talking with Alexis Johnson about it one time.
                        He said, “My goodness, we spent all these years building USIS as a symbol of
                        cooperation and friendship and help to other countries, and here your people
                        are now just destroying all that.” He said he was one of the pioneers who
                        supported USIS. I recall our old friend Jerry Stryker was in Singapore at
                        that time as PAO, and I understand he sent back a list about the whole
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: It was a funny message.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was short-lived, wasn't it? It went out with
                        Carter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: When the new administration came in, they were determined to change the
                    name back, much to my relief. But it didn't happen for several months. It was
                    after we moved down to the new building that it was officially changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Among others who favored going back to the old was Chuck
                        Percy and others on the Hill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>There's a little bit of tape left, and you have it at your disposal, Cliff, if
                    you want to philosophize.</p>
                <p>GROCE: There are some anecdotes from the VOA days that I neglected to include, at
                    least one of which I think is very funny, and it has to do with the strowger and
                    what the strowger does and can do.</p>
                <p>Strowgers used to be sought after by certain officials. Everybody wanted to have
                    a strowger in his office, in the State Department and in Agency area offices and
                    so on, the White House. One day, we were recording a “Press Conference USA,”
                    which was a half-hour discussion program patterned along the lines of “Meet the
                    Press” and “Face the Nation,” in which a prominent guest appears every week.
                    Some of the reporters are ours, and some of the reporters are outsiders. One day
                    we were recording an interview with Nicholas [de B.] Katzenbach, when he was
                    Attorney General of the United States during the Johnson Administration.
                    Suddenly, the phone rings on the producer's desk in the control room, and the
                    producer picks it up. The voice at the other end says, “Let me have Nick
                    Katzenbach.”</p>
                <p>And the producer says, “I'm sorry, he's recording a program.”</p>
                <p>“I know he's recording a program. I'm listening to it.” It was Lyndon Johnson! He
                    got him out of the studio, in the control room, didn't like the way he had said
                    something. He wanted him to go back and re-describe that situation, re-phrase
                    the thing, because he was not satisfied. And like a sheepish schoolboy,
                    Katzenbach goes back—he's a huge man—goes back in, sits down, and they have to
                    go back and re-record part of this thing. But Lyndon Johnson was sitting in the
                    White House, listening to this recording being made.</p>

                <p>GROCE: I also should have talked some about the marvelous days we had covering
                    the space program, because that was one of our proudest achievements. Of course,
                    that was the time when Henry Loomis was in East Africa and bumped into this guy
                    out in the middle of nowhere in the bush, and the guy had heard about the
                    landing on the moon on the Voice of America. He didn't know Henry Loomis was
                    from the Voice of America, but he said this guy listened to BBC, to Radio
                    Moscow, to Radio Vatican. He listened to a variety of places, he was a very
                    well-informed man, and he was really a leader in his community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Henry was an excellent public servant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Oh, absolutely!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later, when I went to work for him at the Corporation for
                        Public Broadcasting, I got caught in a political squeeze and resigned, but I
                        still like and respect Henry, a guy who, in the old-fashioned way of wealthy
                        people, feels he has a responsibility as a public servant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Noblesse oblige.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had two uncles whose names were Henry—Henry Stimson and
                        another one, another Henry. So as a result, they decided not to use that. So
                        Henry Loomis is his full legal name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: Henry Stimson was Henry Loomis Stimson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. There are many interesting stories about the
                        Voice. Shall I throw in one quick one here? When the Russians invaded
                        Hungary, Barmine, the head of the Russian service, led his whole staff down
                        to the Hungarian service, not a word was spoken about what had happened, but
                        just to stop by for coffee—marched his troops in and marched them out, and
                        that was it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROCE: I never heard that story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very touching story, really.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>GROCE: I did talk to Henry about the stories that went around about VOA helping
                    to incite the revolution in Hungary. He was in research at the time. He said
                    that all the evidence they had was there was no such involvement of the Voice at
                    all, that the Hungarian people were ready to blow, and so if John Foster Dulles
                    said something and we reported it, if they consider that inciting, why, that was
                    the extent to which it happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom Tuch and I were talking the other day about our
                        respective roles in jamming, especially when Khrushchev came to the United
                        States. I learned about it first from Bob Mayer, who had a little listening
                        device on the roof. Bob came down one day and said, “Jack, I think they've
                        stopped jamming.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I said, “Well, okay, I'll put some calls in.” We had some monitors, remember,
                    around the world. I put calls in and couldn't reach any of them. I called up
                    George Allen. Henry was out of town. I called up George Allen and said, “I think
                    they've stopped jamming.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Goodness sakes. Confirm it if you can. I want to tell the White
                    House.”</p>
                <p>So I couldn't reach a monitor, so I said, “Put in a call to Lee Brady in Moscow.”
                    Got a hold of Lee and said, “Lee, is it true?”</p>
                <p>He said, “You bet it's true.”</p>
                <p>So with that, I called Allen and he went to the White House with it. The
                    difficult part came, as you may recall, when they resumed jamming on a selective
                    basis. Thank God for Wanda Allender Washburn. She was one of the special
                    assistants, she and Ruth Walter Crook. It was a nightmare, because Barmine and
                    company had to continue their regular broadcasting and then listen to tapes of
                    what had been jammed and put down on paper what the topic was. Eisenhower
                    personally was very interested, and these had to be daily reports to the White
                    House on what they were jamming and not. It had significance, but I don't know
                    to this day how we did it, how Barmine and company did it. But Wanda was the one
                    that I give credit to for organizing it and keeping track of it.</p>
                <p>Tom was talking about his job in Moscow. He had to monitor the jammers. It had
                    been on in Morse Code, and he had to learn Morse Code. But it was an astonishing
                    period and one that I hope is not repeated.</p>
