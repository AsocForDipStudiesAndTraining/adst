                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is February 23, 1995. This is an interview with
                        Kempton B. Jenkins, on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies, and
                        I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Could we start with when, where you were born
                        and a bit about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I was born in 1926 in Florida where my father was a contractor on the
                    Tamiami Trail. But we were only there for about six months or so before Florida
                    went bankrupt, an interesting parallel to the District of Columbia today as we
                    talk here. And my father and mother moved back to Long Island which was their
                    home and where I grew up until World War II started December 7, 1941 when my
                    father, on the occasion of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, rushed down to the Army
                    Engineers and signed up and accepted a commission even though he was 45 years
                    old. So we moved around a great deal during the war and I went to three
                    different high schools when he was going from one engineer post to another,
                    mostly building plants for the defense effort, and he would be in charge of the
                    Army's oversight of the civilian contracts.</p>
                <p>In 1944 I went in the Navy Officers Training Program, called V-5, and they
                    shipped me off to Bowling Green in Ohio, which is where we were in Cincinnati at
                    the time. And my main memories of those four semesters in the Navy at Bowling
                    Green, as a midshipman, was essentially playing basketball for the Bowling Green
                    team which ranked number two in the country that year. I met my wife-to-be
                    there, and went off to Notre Dame for four months, and then off to Alameda Naval
                    Air Station when the war ended. I returned to Bowling Green and finished
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any particular major while you were at
                        Bowling Green?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: While I was there in the Navy I was taking all kinds of things like
                    thermodynamics, navigation, etc. When I came back I switched to history and
                    political science. My professors urged me to think about taking the Foreign
                    Service exam, which I did upon graduation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated in 1948?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>JENKINS: In 1948. I came to Washington, took the exam. I took this little cram
                    course at GW, which David Dean and several others of us took at the time, and
                    finished my Master's and went into the State Department on the 1st of May 1950.
                    It was approximately a week later, I think, that Joe McCarthy made his speech in
                    Wheeling, West Virginia, saying, “I have here in my hand the names of 57
                    communists in the State Department.” All hell broke loose. I was in Public
                    Affairs, a section of the State Department in those days, on temporary
                    assignment waiting for my FSO commission, and spent all of my time working on
                    the McCarthy issue. Acheson was the Secretary, Marshall Shulman was his special
                    assistant, and I was sort of the errand boy for Marshall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say working on, what did that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, we were doing statements, interviews with the new television
                    media, for example, and the radio, and helping Acheson with press statements and
                    office memos and that sort of thing. Carl Humelsine and Jim Webb were the top
                    management for the Department. The most dramatic thing that I can remember is
                    the discovery that Roy Cohn was a practicing homosexual which somehow the FBI,
                    or the U.S. government picked up that information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Senator McCarthy's press...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: He was Senator McCarthy's staff aide on the hearings on the State
                    Department. Again, I was a junior officer in all this. Humelsine made an
                    appointment to meet with McCarthy and confront him with this information with
                    the idea that McCarthy would back off because he really never did have that list
                    and there never were those names. The whole thing was a canard. But the
                    assumption was that McCarthy would back off because in those days it was a great
                    embarrassment for this tough “anti-communist” who among other things accused the
                    Department of “harboring homosexuals,” and it turns out that his staffer is
                    queer—that is the language we used in those years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The idea being that anybody in that position was
                        automatically a security risk because they could be blackmailed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes. Upon arrival for the meeting with McCarthy, he laid on the
                    table—and I was not at that meeting personally, but I had helped prepare for it,
                    and was present in the debriefing of Humelsine when he came back—a dossier on
                    Sumner Welles who had been picked up by the police in Thomas Circle for
                    “molesting a child.” So the two sides agreed to swap those pieces of information
                    and drop them. And that's what happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They both became rather renowned. Sumner Welles, in later
                        years, there were lots of stories that came out, and Cohn and Schine were
                        sort of the gay boys flitting around Europe. It was a ridiculous
                        period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: It was a very bizarre entrance into the Foreign Service. As the result
                    of that I came in with the same attitude, I think, my entire generation had,
                    somewhat cynical. It was an awe-inspiring period in our history. We arrived all
                    starry eyed and gung ho to make a contribution to the new world. It was only a
                    few years after the end of the war, and we were greeted by this terribly cynical
                    distortion of reality, and which dominated everybody's attention. And the senior
                    officials in government, and Congress including Senator Taft for example,
                    behaved terribly, and they were cowards in the face of this
                    situation—McCarthyism. So we became, I think my entire generation of Foreign
                    Service officers, somewhat jaded about being able to rely on political figures,
                    and jaded about the Hill, which is interesting because I ended up running H in
                    the State Department later on. But the contrast was very sad and upsetting to
                    us.</p>
                <p>When I was studying at George Washington, I used to use the library that belonged
                    to the Carnegie endowment, which is now a piece of the Blair House right on the
                    corner, kitty-corner from the White House. And at that point the Truman balcony
                    was being built, and Truman lived in Blair House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Truman balcony on the White House.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes. And each day I would be in this board room poring over books for my
                    graduate papers, etc., and roughly at noon or 12:15 or so each day, the
                    President would walk from the White House, wait for the light, one security
                    policeman with him, walk across the street under the little bay window that
                    still hangs out over Pennsylvania Avenue, tip his hat to us because we were
                    always in the window, and we would wave to him, and he would walk into Blair
                    House for lunch, and then he'd walk back. And each day he'd have either Dean
                    Acheson, or Cap Krug, or Jim Forrestal with him. So we were watching history
                    unfold. It was very exciting, and very inspirational for a young Foreign Service
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me on this McCarthy thing, there was nothing like
                        sort of a wide eyed look at something when you're first in an organization
                        and you're young. Were you sharing this with other Foreign Service
                        officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Oh, yes. We were all talking openly about it. While we all shared the
                    awe that I sensed in this little story, which should have been the whole thing,
                    was being counter undermined by this really very gross performance by the
                    executive branch, including Truman eventually who kept trying to cut a deal with
                    McCarthy to get him to knock it off, instead of confronting him and slapping him
                    down. It carried over into the Eisenhower period. We were all very disappointed
                    in Eisenhower who had the prestige nationally to slap McCarthy down. He knew
                    McCarthy was a fraud. But he went out and campaigned for him in Wisconsin after
                    McCarthy had denounced General Marshall as a traitor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “A knowing front for traitors,” I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I think that was the phrase. But it made us all somewhat less than
                    enthusiastic about the Eisenhower administration. And, of course, I was in the
                    building when Dulles made his famous speech to the assembled employees of the
                    State Department on arrival, and he reassured us that he knew that most of us
                    were loyal. Which was an incredible thing. So the Eisenhower administration did
                    not start out as a very popular organization for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came in in 1950?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: 1950, and I was hired on a temporary job as an FSO eligible, they called
                    us, waiting for my commission to be approved. I had this very interesting
                    temporary job with Marshall Shulman at that time, and then my commission came up
                    and I went off to Germany in the spring of '51.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Marshall Shulman a bit. What was his
                        background, and how did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: He was an academic, I don't recall exactly where he came from, but he
                    was doing speech writing and general specialist work for the Secretary. And
                    because of the onslaught against the Department, in connection with McCarthyism,
                    he was really focusing on defending the State Department and Secretary Acheson,
                    and I was sort of an errand boy for him, which allowed me to see a lot, and I
                    got to write some things, etc. I did all kinds of odd jobs, trying to make
                    appointments with CBS for a radio show. One of the first TV programs on Sunday
                    Public Affairs programs, the State Department put together a program called,
                    “The Diplomatic Pouch.” It featured talks with important American ambassadors
                    and senior Department officials.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>A funny thing happened in that period. Not long after I got to the State
                    Department, Paul Smith, a friend of mine who took the cram course with me, and
                    subsequently became a Foreign Service officer as well, and our wives, went down
                    to the Chesapeake Bay for a beer party. When we got there we decided we didn't
                    like the party very much, there were jelly fish in the bay so you couldn't swim,
                    so we decided we'd figure out an excuse—we were both in these temporary jobs in
                    the State Department. We told our host that, “We have to leave. We've just been
                    called back to the Department for a special emergency.” We didn't have anything
                    in mind, we were just getting out of there the best we could. Driving back with
                    the radio on, we heard the announcement that the North Koreans had invaded South
                    Korea. So everybody at that party thought we were terribly important. It was
                    just a fluke. But that was an interesting time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it then, and then subsequently, dealing with
                        McCarthyism, was it just that the State Department didn't know how to deal
                        with this, or just wasn't getting the backing of the administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: It was an unprecedented experience for the institution, and for the
                    people in the institution. On the whole I think the professionals in the State
                    Department responded well. Nobly they banned together and they refused to
                    kowtow. The political appointees at the upper levels, were trying to deal with
                    it through manipulating their relationship with Congress somehow. And there was
                    this sense that we'd won the war; there was a letdown that followed, and this
                    conspiracy concept of communism gripped the country. And it was fueled by
                    McCarthy. It was considered a threat to our very society. Truman initially also
                    didn't quite know what to do about it. And when Eisenhower came into office an
                    awful lot of people who were attacking so-called Marxist-Leninist elements
                    within the government, came to positions of authority. Several senior people in
                    the Department were appointed. Bill Knowland's deputy from the Oakland Journal,
                    or whatever it was, became Counselor of the Department. And we had a man who
                    arrived out in Bangkok as DCM who was Senator Styles Bridges' aide. Styles
                    Bridges was a big McCarthy supporter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a senator from New Hampshire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: It took really almost a decade for the country to come together, and
                    recognize this was all wrong. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, and Watkins of
                    Utah, were two heroes who finally stood up and called a spade a spade. And once
                    somebody did that, all of the other members felt they had cover and they fell in
                    behind them. But Eisenhower should have taken that step. He had the authority
                    and responsibility to do it, and had the national prestige to do it. But he just
                    stayed away from the issue which I thought was pretty disgraceful.</p>

                <p>JENKINS: '51 until June of '54, the first time. I was in Munich for a year, in
                    the visa section. It was fun being in Bavaria but the responsibility of the job
                    was not much.</p>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>JENKINS: No. I was in the displaced persons program. We were trying to help the
                    waves of emigration out of the collapsed European economy into the United
                    States. It was a good program, it needed to be done, but the processing was
                    duplicative, and I witnessed for the first time the role and influence of ethnic
                    minority groups in the United States. The Baltic SS divisions, e.g., which were
                    brutal, came forward as displaced persons because the Baltic Americans were
                    organized and were supported by the Lutheran church in this country. They were
                    not only allowed to come to the United States, their trip was subsidized, and
                    they were placed in jobs when they got here. Some of them were pretty bad
                    people. We saw Vlasov's army, the Russian-American community in this country
                    helped them, and the joint Jewish group was trying to help the remnants of the
                    Jewish community of Europe to get to the United States. So you had terrible
                    anguishing experiences, and I, under the law, was forced to turn down a Jewish
                    survivor who wanted to come to the United States because he had been convicted
                    in a German court during the Nazi period of stealing firewood. Well that's a
                    crime “involving moral turpitude” in the way the law was written. That man was
                    excludable, while at the same time I was supposed, I didn't, but I was told to
                    process the papers for an SS colonel who was a Volksdeutsch, a German resident
                    in Latvia in one of the SS divisions. The law did the job in a macabre sense,
                    but there were many instances of individual tragedies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I ended up in the Refugee Relief Program which sort of
                        cleaned up. One thing that it did do was to certainly give us all a feeling
                        for not only the ethnic diversity of Europe, but also the ethnic hatreds and
                        tensions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Oh, yes, that was very clear and we had lots of personal experiences
                    with that. Anyhow, it was not a happy job for me, and it didn't require a lot of
                    background or understanding. There was not much judgment involved, the law was
                    really cut and dried. But I learned a lot through osmosis, I guess, as you
                    suggest, about the tragedy—the depth of the tragedy which the war visited upon
                    the European populations.</p>

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>JENKINS: I was meant to go into the passport section of the consulate and I was
                    dreading that because that was even more depressing. When I went to the Consul
                    General, Sam Woods, who was a political appointee, he had been in commerce for a
                    while, and his wife was the heiress to the German part of the Anheuser-Busch
                    (her name was Minnie Busch). He was not a very inspiring Consul General for
                    starry-eyed young officers. I announced that I wanted to go to Frankfurt to see
                    Mr. McCloy, who was then the High Commissioner, to see if I could get a position
                    in the High Commission offices in the British zone. They were opening American
                    offices in Hamburg, Hannover and Bremen. Woods didn't like the fact that I
                    wanted to leave Munich and his consulate general, but he acquiesced, and I went
                    to Frankfurt to meet a man named Elmer Lower who subsequently became head of
                    Mutual Broadcasting, and talked my way into being appointed as an information
                    officer in Hannover in Lower Saxony, in the British zone. I arrived there with
                    three other people. Someone who did the exchanges program, somebody did Cultural
                    Affairs and ran the library, and myself. I had a budget, I had a quota to pick
                    promising young Germans in the immediate area and send them to the United States
                    for the exchange program. I had eight Volkswagen buses, a hundred film
                    projectors, and a library of 2,000 documentary films about democracy in the
                    United States, and elections, and all that sort of thing. I hired four local
                    employees and we took off. I went all over Lower Saxony organizing committees to
                    use these projectors, training them on how to use them. I did a speaking tour
                    about the Stevenson-Eisenhower election, and I worked with what became the core
                    of the new German army, the Grenzpolizei they were called, border protection,
                    border police. I spoke at each one of their camps and headquarters about the
                    electoral process. This was all in German. It was great training for my language
                    being immersed in that at the age of 25 when your ear is still flexible. I came
                    out with very good German which to this day I still retain. It was an
                    interesting time because these young Germans and their officers who were former
                    officers would attack me in these public forums where I was talking about
                    elections, etc., for not supporting them and trying to overthrow communism. It
                    was a very interesting challenging experience.</p>
                <p>I then moved up to Hamburg for a year and continued to do the same sort of work.
                    Among other things we licensed and subsidized the new German press. We founded a
                    magazine based on Time called Der Spiegel, which still continues, a somewhat
                    scurrilous journal these days and more like People magazine than like Time used
                    to be. But for somebody 26-27 years old it was a lot of management experience. I
                    had my own budget to submit, I controlled my own budget, and I had personnel
                    whom I hired (they were all very well educated), very attractive young Germans.
                    Two of them went on to become members of the Bundestag, congressmen in Germany.
                    I played on the German tennis team in Hannover which was fun, the DTV club,
                    where I was playing with two Davis cup players, and that was a lot of fun.</p>
                <p>In Hamburg we continued that. I used tennis throughout the Foreign Service as a
                    great entree because it was a way of getting into the local community. I joined
                    the club in Hamburg as well. I was always able to play on the club team, we
                    traveled and played other clubs and it was a very good way of insinuating myself
                    into the society.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: National Geographic types of feature films, not heavy propaganda. They
                    were real documentaries from our own school system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were they received?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I had thought it would be pretty arrogant for us, the United States, to
                    send somebody my age to lecture to German school teachers. At the end of the
                    war, this was 1950, five years after the war is over, the Germans were so numb
                    by what they had been through, and they were so psychologically paralyzed by a
                    tremendous sense of guilt, and of defensiveness, and if there had been the
                    opportunity to be a high-priced psychiatrist in Germany, you could have made
                    millions of dollars. The whole country was a basket case. So they were looking
                    for something, anything to indicate that they were acceptable as human beings.
                    They found us generally, and not just myself, but all of my colleagues had this
                    same experience, encouraging that we were prepared to listen to them. We had an
                    assumption that if they had been bad, they'd have been sent to jail, which was a
                    bit naive but on the whole the worst offenders were in fact separated out from
                    the society. And our willingness to deal with them, to provide them with things
                    like sound film projectors, which were unknown in Germany...I mean nobody was
                    driving cars, the country was on a bicycle. And food was short. We had materiel
                    to give them, we had the language, we were not the occupiers, we became the
                    partners. And we had trips to the United States, and we were flooding the United
                    States with people from Germany. I had 140 people a year that I could send for
                    up to a year to the United States in my own district, Lower Saxony. I think we
                    all felt that we were succeeding, and I think history would confirm that
                    fact.</p>
                <p>We hit them at a psychologically disarmed time. I know if you go to Germany today
                    you don't get that kind of a reaction to a 26 year old diplomat. But we were
                    perceived as something special. It wasn't arduous but we benefited from it, and
                    I liked the fact that we took full advantage of it.</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>JENKINS: I might say it was a great experience in contrast to a stultifying
                    experience of stamping visas and going into the passport division, which most
                    young Foreign Service officers in those days had to do...we were given
                    tremendous management responsibilities, we designed our own programs, we were
                    dealing with high level people in the government very early on, and it trained
                    me. I like to think I'm a good manager, I spent ten years after the Foreign
                    Service in a major steel corporation as a manager and a corporate vice
                    president, and I ran big programs in the government in my last 15 years, and I
                    think I did it successfully. And the reason I was able to do that was...I don't
                    think managers are born, you learn it the old fashioned way. And when I was
                    young, and very impressionable, I had to shape myself and my attitudes for the
                    first working experience of any significance was in big management;
                    responsibilities where I was clearly over my head, on paper at least, but it
                    worked out well because I was enthusiastic and I had the language, and the
                    audience was very receptive. And that stood me in very good stead from then on
                    throughout the Service, and into my private sector career afterwards.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about a time when being a German was not a

                        over from the war. You were sending these I assume young Germans...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: We had a lot of middle-aged teachers, 35-40 years old, in those days in
                    Germany it was middle age.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was their experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: When they came over here? Well, interestingly enough we recognized early
                    on that the selection process was critical and to choose the right people. And
                    secondly, the follow-up was even more critical. So we did stay in touch with
                    them when they came back. And therefore I am in a position to answer your
                    question. The programs that are run now by A.I.D. and USIA, there's damn little
                    follow-up. It's all contracted out to non-governmental organizations, and we
                    don't have any government follow-up and I think it suffers. But in those days we
                    did have the follow-up. On the whole an overwhelming majority of them came back
                    very, very positive. Americans in those days, and still today I believe, are
                    awfully forgiving. And these were people who were too young during the Nazi
                    period to ever have had any significant positions. And they were clearly stuck
                    with it. They didn't create the problem, and I think most Americans reacted that
                    way to them. They went with great trepidation, and I think they were astounded
                    at the receptivity and hospitality they found.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>I might say that one of the interesting experiences I had in those years, and
                    subsequently when I went back to Germany in 1958, I met dozens of Germans who
                    would come up to me in restaurants, and say, “You're an American aren't you? I
                    just want to thank you and your country. I was a POW in the United States during
                    the war, they were the best ten months of my life.” The Army, very
                    intelligently, took those POWs and put them to work doing constructive things,
                    gave them opportunities for education. In fact, treated them almost like
                    visitors. There were some exceptions to that, but on the whole I never met a
                    former POW in the United States who did not, on balance at least, consider it a
                    plus. Most of them were very enthusiastic, and very pro-American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was there in '55 and it was very hard for me to relate
                        to Germans who'd wax enthusiastic about Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana,
                        because that's where most of our camps were, and I was thinking,
                        particularly in those days, those were the pits. They would come out with
                        these names, oh boy, I was in Meridian, Mississippi, oh wow!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Coming from what they were coming from it was very comfortable. But
                    anyhow, I think it's a period in our history of which we can be very proud, and
                    I feel very blessed to have been part of it at a very young age, and I benefited
                    from the experience tremendously.</p>

                    back in those first four years, but I may have done. But I remember the new
                    State Department building was being built and everybody stood out in the
                    construction area, which at that point was a flat dirt field, and he spoke from
                    a little temporary wooden platform.</p>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Precisely. It had a very bad impact on all of us. I did come back in '54
                    for home leave. My late wife was from Lake Bluff, outside Chicago, a very
                    conservative part of the country in those days, and we were really embarrassed
                    because old friends of her family wouldn't receive us because I was in the State
                    Department. That's how poisoned the atmosphere was at this McCarthy
                    situation.</p>
                <p>From Hamburg, which I enjoyed tremendously...we had a very impressive cadre of
                    people there, Spike Dubs who was murdered in Afghanistan, where he was our
                    ambassador; Bruce Laingen, who was our chief hostage, whom you know; and Frank
                    Meehan who became ambassador in East Berlin, Czechoslovakia and Poland. All four
                    of us were there together. You can understand why I was so proud of the Foreign
                    Service because to me this was average. They were splendid men. To this day
                    Bruce is a close friend of mine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is Frank Meehan now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: He's in Scotland, he's retired, his wife is Scottish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel any particular hand of the American military
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: No. The American military at that point...mind you, this was after the
                    High Commission had been established, we got there virtually as McCloy took over
                    as High Commissioner. The military occupation was, by definition at that point,
                    ended. There were a lot of military around, we had a lot of troops and a lot of
                    bases. Originally, we were recruited to replace the military governors at the
                    Kreis, or county level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Called Kreis Resident Office.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>JENKINS: And I was pulled off, along with 12 others, Allen James, myself, Orme
                    Wilson, Bruce Laingen, Pete Day, because we were FSOs. And out of this group of
                    45 whom they had selected to do this, 12 of us were FSOs, and the minute we were
                    commissioned, which happened while we were over there—soon after we got there—we
                    were jerked out of the resident officer program, and put into the consulates to
                    do the DP work. That was also a crisis because the law ran out on the 1st of
                    January in 1952, and they had to process all these people, and get these camps
                    cleaned up. We had to do what we were told, so they did that to us. And then the
                    others who had gone over with us, and trained with us for three months, were
                    able to remain as Kreis officers which was wonderful, a civilianized military
                    governor of a German county, and they were doing all this film and exchange
                    programs which I talked about when I went to Hannover. So it was an interesting
                    period. Our attitude toward the military at that time was not very high. Most of
                    the people who were over there were draftees who came in after the war was over,
                    they didn't want to be there, there was a lot of black-marketing, and they
                    didn't do their job well, they didn't have any language. We all arrived with
                    German, 3-3 level at that point, and some a lot better than that, dedicated to a
                    much higher standard of performance, and so we looked down our noses at these
                    people. Now, there were plenty of wonderful officers who were there but we're
                    talking about a half million troops. The Germans tolerated it, they weren't
                    angry about it, but they didn't respect them very much. They did respect us
                    because we came in able to converse in their language.</p>
                <p>Well the natural sort of backwash after a war, the people then end up in the
                    military because the draft is still going on. They weren't highly motivated,
                    they weren't carefully selected, and they weren't terribly good. But I think
                    it's totally explainable. I don't think their behavior was a disgrace or
                    anything, it just wasn't very...and we felt fairly elite about ourselves and
                    what we were doing in the company of Spike Dubs, Frank Meehan and people like
                    that. You can see why I felt elite.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with the SPD? The CDU we were obviously more

                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: The SPD man, Shumacher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we comfortable with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>JENKINS: I think the High Commissioner, who was McCloy and followed by James
                    Conant from Harvard, the headquarters were uncomfortable with Shumacher clearly
                    because he was an ideological socialist, and he was a hard tough nut. But when
                    we were dealing with the local SPD (Lower Saxony was ruled by the SPD), we found
                    them very pro-American, very internationalist. They didn't reflect the old
                    school of Shumacher. They were enlightened. It was becoming the party of Willy
                    Brandt, the youth group, the Falcon youth group, was among the best in terms of
                    using our film projectors and being interested in organizing local elections,
                    getting people to the polls, all that kind of participative democracy which was
                    one of our objectives. The SPD was very cooperative. We had a little bit more
                    trouble with the conservatives. There were some Catholic bishops in West Germany
                    at that time who had collaborated in the Hitler period and were more
                    reactionary. Bavaria was more conservative than Lower Saxony. So being in Lower
                    Saxony I didn't run into a lot of the conservative ingredient. But on the
                    fringes were the extremist nationalist parties. They never rose above 5-6-7%,
                    but I had every county in Lower Saxony on a big map in my office and on each one
                    I had the percentages of the parties in the election. And where the
                    reactionaries did the best, and they were neo-Nazis, that's where I put my
                    principal efforts to try and strengthen the local newspapers, send people to the
                    United States for training, set up film programs there, work with the SPD and
                    the CDU people and try to contain extremism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say strengthen the local newspaper, what does
                        that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: It meant giving them subsidies so they could buy more news print,
                    sending a foreign affairs editor to the United States for three months, making
                    sure they got the material which we sent out. We had a wireless file, and we ran
                    a newspaper called Die Neue Zeitung, which was probably the best paper in German
                    history, patterned after the New York Times, but a hell of a lot more objective
                    than even the Times, and a lot of former newspapermen from the New York Times,
                    Washington Post, and others, were in fact in Germany working. The editor of DNZ
                    was a German-American who had come to the Times. And we had a monthly magazine
                    called the Der Monat, which was a combination Foreign Affairs-Harpers opinion
                    magazine which was very well respected. So we got right into the middle of it,
                    and when TV began, the television station for Hamburg, Hannover and Bremen, we
                    helped provide them with training people and subsidized some of the equipment.
                    Our objective was to create a participative democracy in Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view on the one side the neo-Nazis, and the
                        other side the communists cadre in your area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, the communists in our area (we were sort of on the border with the
                    Russians), never were a significant factor. They were rather like the American
                    communist party. Historically, of course, that was quite different and many of
                    the old-line socialists, Schumacher, had in fact come out of the communist party
                    in Germany. But that was all ancient history really. The only threat that we saw
                    to a viable democracy was on the right. I never felt, and I don't think any of
                    us ever felt that it was likely to succeed, but it certainly could cause
                    problems. We would go to rallies of refugees from East Prussia, for example, and
                    they were very nationalistic. They had a lot of the old Nazi symbols without the
                    swastika. And those speeches were scary, and to be in that place was reminiscent
                    of what it was like to be in Nazi Germany. But they were rare, and they didn't
                    represent ever more than 3-4-5% of the population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By that time would you say control had been passed to the
                        Germans? While you were observing it, it wasn't as though you had a whistle
                        and bring the police in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: You're absolutely right. We had no governing authority. All our
                    influence was really based on close working relationships with the local
                    population. As a group the resident officers in the American zone, and all of us
                    in the British zone, I think, did a very good job.</p>

                <p>JENKINS: '54, came home on leave, ran into this terrible McCarthy-like atmosphere
                    in Lake Forest and Lake Bluff. I was assigned to Bangkok. I had asked for

                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, I think that's what is missing. I don't think there was anything

                        got some points to make, don't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes. I've brought some things along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Why don't I turn it over to you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I was a fish out of water in Bangkok. I'd spent five years in Germany. I
                    had put in for transfer to either Budapest or Prague, and ended up getting
                    orders to Bangkok to my amazement. In those days, as it should be even today,
                    when you're sent to somewhere, that's where you go if you're a Foreign Service
                    officer. So to me it was a cultural shock certainly arriving after the
                    relatively comfortable years in Germany, with one young child, and our Airedale,
                    in Bangkok, and being met by the heat of summer, living in a very inadequate
                    little sort of rooming house until we were able to find a house. Then moving in
                    and setting up housekeeping. It was the real Foreign Service as opposed to the
                    occupation world that we lived in in Germany.</p>
                <p>We quickly became enamored of the people in Thailand who had great charm and
                    grace. Also quickly became involved in the politics and economics of the
                    situation, and proceeded to spend two fascinating years in an area which was the
                    center of things at that stage. Dien Bien Phu had just collapsed...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about Dien Bien Phu in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: ...were defeated definitively by the Viet Minh. And the French were
                    busily engaged in disengaging but trying to make sure that we didn't go in and
                    pick up the pieces and “succeed” where they'd failed. Our relations with the
                    French were not good at that time because we were beginning to move out into
                    relations in their empire, and they did not like it. It made for a very
                    interesting political setting. Dulles had argued in favor of intervention in
                    Dien Bien Phu, but had been overruled by President Eisenhower. As a fall back
                    position we organized an Asian counterpart to NATO, called SEATO, which included
                    Thailand, Malaysia—then Malaya—and Pakistan, the Philippines, United States,
                    Great Britain, France, Australia and New Zealand. Rather Jerry-built in terms of
                    its political logic, but it was typical of many things we did, and I guess still
                    do; to confuse activity for action. There were a lot of meetings and
                    conferences.</p>
                <p>One of the early responsibilities I had was to sit in on the SEATO formation
                    conference, together with our allies in all these countries. We designed the
                    basic documents for SEATO, drawing heavily on the NATO documents. I worked
                    particularly on the economic and cultural papers. Then, we wrote the
                    constitution for SEATO. None of us were terribly convinced that it was going to
                    do what Dulles intended it to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Now, mind you, this was shortly after the arrival of the Eisenhower
                    administration, the integration into the Foreign Service at the top level of
                    several conservative, politically correct figures, in which Dulles, who was very
                    suspicious of the Foreign Service, tried to lard the Foreign Service with people
                    who would be more sympathetic to his policies, and less “liberal.” We had
                    several senior officers assigned to the Bangkok embassy, former aides to
                    conservative senators and congressmen, and ex-FBI agents, and so forth, all of
                    whom had sort of made their reputation as hardliners, the presumption being that
                    those of us who were in the Foreign Service before that election were not
                    sufficiently loyal, which, of course, was totally incorrect, and unfair.</p>
                <p>On arrival I was assigned as commercial attach� in the embassy. My early
                    responsibilities included dealing with the Commerce Department's functions in
                    Bangkok, and I had three or four high profile events which were very interesting
                    and made the first year very interesting for me.</p>
                <p>First, I was assigned to support Jim Thompson in his court case. Jim was the
                    founder of Thaibok Silk. He had been an OSS agent up country in Thailand
                    undercover when the Japanese occupied the country during World War II. While he
                    was there he lived among the peasants, and he became familiar with the
                    hand-woven Thai silk which the peasants in these small villages were weaving,
                    and using for their fabric-they're beautiful silks; a coarse weave, but all the
                    more attractive therefore. They had wonderful bright and quite unique hues. Jim
                    watched all of this while he was living undercover, and at the end of the war
                    organized a program with the government and the support of the Queen to try to
                    standardize the dyes so that the silk could be produced, and you could order
                    ahead of time a certain shade of blue, and you'd get that shade. Up until this
                    time the dyes had been essentially a product of the individual preference and
                    taste of the farmer whose wife was doing the weaving, and they just threw in
                    various amounts of cobalt, etc., to make the colors. Once the dye had been
                    standardized, Jim had a product which was quite unique, Thai silk is unique.
                    It's beautiful, it's made to order for home decoration—interior decorators—and
                    for clothes, ladies suits, scarves, and even tuxedo jackets, etc. And he
                    organized this firm, incorporated it, and called it Thaibok, and it became
                    immediately a success. First, in Bangkok, then he started advertising in the New
                    Yorker, and opened a New York office, and it took off, and became a big success.
                    Within a year of doing this, while he was on a New York business trip, his
                    partner, who was from Laos, a Lao, absconded with the dye formulae, and set up a
                    competing firm around the corner. So when Jim returned from New York, he faced
                    this guy who'd walked off with all his dye formulae and he had to recreate all
                    of those. And secondly, he was being out priced by this competitor. So he
                    brought suit in the Thai courts.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>My first job as commercial attach�, was to go to court with Jim and try to assist
                    him in shutting down the competition which he felt was illegal under Thai law.
                    He won that suit after a fashion. Winning the suit really didn't solve the
                    problem, but he did win the suit. Through that process I became a good friend of
                    Jim's, and became fascinated by his interesting background. He subsequently had
                    us to his home for dinner several times. He had one of the great collections of
                    Thai antiques, and going to his house for dinner was truly a cultural
                    experience. The food was fabulous, the company was great. My wife became a
                    tremendous fan of his and we bought Christmas presents for the next twenty years
                    of Thai silk.</p>
                <p>Later, I guess it was fifteen years later, we learned of Jim's untimely death. We
                    were especially saddened. He had gone off on vacation to the mountains of
                    Malaya, the Cameron Highlands, and disappeared during taking a walk after dinner
                    one night. There were a lot of theories that this was a throw-back to his days
                    in the OSS, and he was therefore presumably a continuing CIA agent; that he may
                    have been in the drug business; that he may have been a homosexual, and he may
                    have been done in by a homosexual love affair; or that he may have fallen into a
                    tiger trap of which there were many in that area, and that the Malays were
                    embarrassed about this and therefore never chose to make it public. To this day
                    his death has been unsolved.</p>
                <p>The intrigue is heightened by the fact that approximately two years later his
                    sister was murdered in Connecticut. And a third relative also died an odd death.
                    What this all adds up to, nobody knows. But it is intriguing and it was fun to
                    be involved with Jim Thompson who was a great American, and a great businessman,
                    and had a magnificent eye for color and antiques.</p>
                <p>During that time I went to my first business lunch at the Chamber of Commerce as
                    an invited guest, the new commercial attach� in the U.S. embassy. I was invited
                    to Ho Thien Lao, a restaurant, where we had a tremendous meal. The first course
                    was a soup, and you were invited to use various sauces. I asked, because I've
                    always liked hot food, which one of these sauces was the hottest. A little dish
                    was pointed out and I promptly poured it into my soup and took a spoonful of it,
                    and practically blew up on the spot. I knocked over two glasses of water
                    reaching for a third to douse the flames that were in my throat. And that taught
                    me to be very respectful about hot food in Thailand. In point of fact that sauce
                    was made of hot red peppers which were ground with a pestle, and the oil from
                    the skin of the pepper was what was used to make this sauce. Believe me it is
                    hot. So that was a first introduction really. I found Ho Thien Lao a fascinating
                    restaurant. It was in a building with eight floors. The first two floors were
                    the restaurant, if you went up to the third floor, that's when the dessert
                    started. I said, “What do you mean the dessert?” It was pointed out to me that
                    the top four floors of the restaurant, which supported the restaurant
                    financially, were the best whore house in Thailand. So that was another
                    introduction to Thailand, and what real life was like there. But being
                    commercial attach� was not all boring.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time how did we see the Chinese community, both
                        the commercial activities, but also the Mainland Chinese connection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, that was a major element in what we were trying to do there. Our
                    purpose for being there, according to Dulles, and it really was our policy, was
                    to try to contain the expansion of communism. In Thailand where approximately
                    20% of the population is Chinese (more than 50% in Bangkok). The Chinese were a
                    tremendously influential component of the population. It's true all over
                    southeast Asia, as you know. It's true in the Philippines, it's true in
                    Indonesia, it's true in all of the countries of East Asia. And their influence
                    really is a reflection of their control of business. The Chinese families, which
                    all have roots in a common Mainland China base, worked together throughout East
                    Asia and they really do dominate business.</p>
                <p>Now in Thailand there was a great sensitivity about the Chinese, and a great
                    antipathy, in many ways. So the Chinese businessman would marry a Thai, set up
                    their corporation, invite the Minister of Defense or the Minister of Police, the
                    Minister of the Air Force, or whoever, to be chairman of the board. They would
                    create this board with maybe six Thai on it, and only one Chinese, namely the
                    man who ran the company. And the Thai were paid off with a handsome director's
                    fee, but were not allowed to get into the business of the company. So this was a
                    facade the Chinese have utilized to get around anti-Chinese sentiment.</p>
                <p>Now, what was really interesting in this situation, was that the Chinese in
                    Thailand were divided between those who were loyal to the Mainland, to the
                    communist regime, and those who looked to Taiwan, where the KMT, the
                    Kuomintang...the Chiang Kai-shek regime was based. And, of course, many of the
                    families played both sides of the fence. But within Bangkok there was tremendous
                    competition among these two factions. The communist Chinese pretty well
                    controlled the Chinese chamber of commerce. They didn't have an embassy, but
                    they had the chamber of commerce which was their instrument of activity, while
                    the Taiwanese had a proper embassy. I would say on balance that the Mainland
                    Chinese pretty well dominated the scene.</p>
                <p>We historically had (and I think that remains true even today) a Chinese language
                    officer on the embassy political staff. In my time it was John Farrior who was a
                    wonderful fellow. He had been stationed in the Mainland before Mao's takeover
                    and was a hostage for a time. As I remember his parents were missionaries there.
                    He was succeeded by Art Rosen who was another Chinese language officer, who was
                    Jewish, and used to laughingly say about Chinese business superiority, that he
                    knew the really potent people in the world were “Chinese Jews.” Art was a
                    wonderful, brilliant, exciting fellow to have at the embassy. Both Art and John
                    were tremendous career Foreign Service officers, as far as I was concerned. I
                    learned a great deal from each of them. The role of the Chinese in Bangkok was
                    very pervasive, very important, and I think we were quite sophisticated as an
                    embassy in recognizing and dealing with it.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>The other big event in my time as a commercial attach�, was the first
                    Constitution Trade Fair. This was the first program under the Eisenhower
                    International Trade Fair program, which was designed to help promote U.S.
                    exports to the world, a real harbinger, way out ahead of the power curve in
                    terms of timing, to the present export efforts of Commerce Secretary Brown today
                    and Bill Verity, the Secretary of Commerce in the Reagan administration (who was
                    superb). My job was to coordinate U.S. participation in this trade fair. The
                    U.S. participation in it was about 90% of the show. It was a great success.
                    Ambassador Jack Peurifoy, who was then our ambassador, had a terrific sense of
                    stage management, and he weighed in back in Washington to make sure that we had
                    good corporate participation. Opening night we had a panoramic screen which was
                    called Cinerama, which, of course, has become quite well known in this country.
                    It was the first time Cinerama had ever been used, and it was breath-taking, in
                    that part of the world particularly. He invited Sihanouk, who was the King of
                    Cambodia to come over for the opening. And Sihanouk and the King of Thailand,
                    Phumiphon, officially opened the trade fair. With Peurifoy in a white silk suit
                    and his attractive wife, there were the two Kings and their beautiful wives. It
                    was a great, high profile operation. For my part, I had a lot of excitement
                    recruiting American companies, assisting them in putting together their
                    exhibits. We had a Thunderbird, one of the first Thunderbirds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A Ford sports car, which is now a classic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: And we had a Chevrolet Corvette. They were the hit of the exhibit.
                    Ironically, at the end of the fair, Ambassador Peurifoy, with General Motors
                    assistance, donated the Corvette to the Prime Minister, Phibun Songgram, as a
                    gift which was extremely well received because Phibun was a car buff. And
                    Peurifoy persuaded his wife to give him the Thunderbird for his birthday
                    present. The ironic part of it is that it was in that Thunderbird that Peurifoy
                    was subsequently killed in an automobile accident in the southern part of
                    Thailand. It was his own fault, he was going much too fast over a one-lane
                    bridge which narrowed to one lane from two, and he didn't see an oncoming truck
                    and he ran head-on into it. Even more tragic, in the process not only was he
                    killed, but his one healthy son was killed. The only survivor was the son who
                    had a bad case of MS. He subsequently died of the disease. Betty Peurifoy, his
                    wife, of course, was totally devastated by this. It was a very sad event and it
                    colored our assignment there profoundly.</p>
                <p>I might flash back a little bit to the evolution of how Peurifoy came to be
                    ambassador. It tells a lot about the Foreign Service, particularly in that time
                    of the first years of the Eisenhower administration. As part of the effort to
                    shore up “the bastion of democracy” in southeast Asia (which we thought was very
                    high flown lingo for essentially something which didn't exist), Eisenhower sent
                    “Wild Bill” Donovan out as ambassador to Thailand...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been head of the OSS during the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>JENKINS: He was rather like Bill Casey in his wheeling and dealing approach, and
                    brought about a tremendous build-up in CIA activities in Thailand which were
                    designed essentially to contain Chinese influence. I think those efforts were
                    less successful, rather than more, but there were many heroic, dedicated CIA
                    officers involved in them, and it's no reflection on them. It caused problems
                    with our neighbors. Donovan, for example, typical of his high-handed approach to
                    the area, launched a major effort to support the Burmese rebels who were
                    essentially KMT troops who had been defeated by the communist in China, and had
                    slipped across the Burmese border, and set up pockets of anti-communist forces
                    in Burma, immune therefore from attack by the Red Chinese. The only problem with
                    this was that the Burmese government took a very dim view of having these
                    foreign forces there. And, they promptly began organizing opium traffic to
                    finance their existence and their arms, etc. Donovan was in the middle of this,
                    providing supplies while denying publicly that there was any U.S.
                    involvement.</p>
                <p>Our ambassador in Rangoon, Joseph Satterthwaite, was called in by the Burmese
                    government to protest U.S. support for foreign intervention into Burma. He
                    denied that we were involved in any way, and the Foreign Minister promptly
                    showed him a display of American equipment, PX rations, and uniforms, and
                    Collins radios, proving in fact there was U.S. equipment there. The ambassador
                    was outraged when he found that in fact Donovan had been running an operation in
                    his country out of Bangkok and he wasn't even informed. As I recall, he resigned
                    in protest over that issue.</p>
                <p>Donovan left not long after we got there. Howard Parsons, who had been the head
                    of A.I.D., was made Charge. Howard was a splendid man, subsequently became a
                    Foreign Service officer and did a nice job until Peurifoy arrived. We learned
                    that Jack Peurifoy was coming with some concern. Peurifoy had been very high
                    profile in the press prior to that for having masterminded the overthrow of the
                    government in Guatemala. President Arbenz had been a democratically elected
                    leftist. U.S. policy at that time in Washington was nervous about communist
                    expansion. This was again a period when McCarthy was riding high back home. It
                    was all historically quite ironic because we were the only great power in the
                    world then, as we are again today. The Soviets could not really match up to us,
                    but they were a threat because they were determined. They clearly didn't have
                    the resources that we did. However, instead of dealing with this confidently,
                    and firmly, we dealt with it in some panic.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>So when Jack Peurifoy arrived in Bangkok, we were nervous. He was seen as a
                    free-swinging interventionist telling local governments what to do, etc. Well,
                    within six weeks we were all in love with Jack Peurifoy. Jack Peurifoy was a
                    great leader of men. He worked that embassy like no ambassador I've ever seen.
                    He was constantly walking around, sitting down on your desk saying, “What are
                    you doing today? What can I do to help? I'm going in to see the Foreign Minister
                    this afternoon, is there anything you'd like me to raise with him?” He'd visit
                    and raise your issue with Prince Wan, the Foreign Minister, and then come back
                    and report to us on what Prince Wan had said. I would then write a telegram
                    reporting on what we'd done. But it was this constant openness, and
                    availability, and respect. He knew he didn't know anything about the area, but
                    he had people on his staff like John Farrior, for example, who knew the Chinese
                    situation; and Al Moscotti (my colleague in the political section), who had a
                    Ph.D. in Thai studies from Yale. A very bright man, bilingual in Thai. We had
                    really great officers. And Jack Peurifoy knew how to use them. He also had a
                    superb DCM named Norbert Anschutz (who remains a close friend of mine). He was a
                    true Mr. Roberts, and a career officer's career officer. He was courageous,
                    debonair, smart, outgoing, articulate, handsome. A terrific man with a wonderful
                    wife, a true “house mother,” a great Foreign Service wife. And the Peurifoys and
                    the Anschutzes turned that embassy around. Before then we had been suspicious of
                    what CIA was up to. And, we were resentful of A.I.D.'s big budget, being run by
                    a man who was a former Postmaster General named Ed Sessions. A perfectly nice
                    man, but he had absolutely no background in this area.</p>
                <p>With Peurifoy's arrival things came together. When he was killed, Norbert became
                    Charge, and he was superb. He lasted about six months, and then under the new
                    administration, out came a man named Max Bishop. Max had been a career officer,
                    a Japanese language officer. He was the only career Foreign Service officer to
                    testify against the Chinese language officers in the period of the witch hunt by
                    McCarthy. He was extremely unpopular among career officers, very reactionary,
                    and paranoid about China.</p>
                <p>Personally, I found him trying hard to be a nice man, very dedicated. He was not
                    in any way lazy, or corruptible. He just had a skewed vision of things, in my
                    judgment. He immediately started trying to get his hands around the embassy
                    which he said was perceived in Washington as left-leaning. Which is a ridiculous
                    thing to accuse Jack Peurifoy and his deputy of, given Peurifoy's successful
                    record of anti-communism.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I remember one infamous occasion when I attended the country team meeting for the
                    political section, and we were talking about what to do for the up-coming SEATO
                    exercises, which I'll talk about in a minute. The economic counselor said
                    something about the Colombo Plan, which was an economic plan put together by
                    India, Ceylon, Malaya, etc., as sort of an economic counterpart to SEATO, but
                    not run by the United States. Bishop blew up and said, “The Colombo Plan is a
                    bunch of damned Socialists, that's a terrible thing, and we should be focusing
                    on SEATO. That's the anti-communist instrument that we should be focusing on, to
                    the exclusion of the Colombo Plan.” And then he got really carried away and
                    said, “You know, I'm fed up with all this talk about the Colombo Plan and the
                    British. Nobody has done anything about SEATO until I got here. I'm the one who
                    has put SEATO on the map in this country.” And Norb Anschutz, who recognized
                    this as perhaps unwitting emotional criticism of the late Jack Peurifoy, very
                    quietly said, “That's a damn lie, Mr. Ambassador, and you know it.” And
                    everybody in that room said a silent vow that wherever he went, we would support
                    Norbert Anschutz. It was a very heroic thing to do. It deflated the ambassador
                    completely, and of course, the ambassador never forgave Norbert for it.
                    Subsequently we received a new DCM named George Wilson who had been Senator
                    Knowland's aide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Senator Knowland being a right-wing senator from San
                        Francisco.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: A very hard-line, very pro-Taiwan, very anti-State Department. Putting
                    Wilson in an embassy was like putting a fox in the chicken coop. It was just
                    outrageous. And Wilson was totally unsuited for the job. He wasn't a mean man
                    personally, but he just was out of his league. It was a stupid appointment.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Bishop subsequently was pulled out after an incident which was quite intriguing.
                    Bertie McCormick, the publisher of the Chicago Tribune, had died and his wife
                    was left owning the newspaper. And she took a trip. She was very interesting,
                    intellectually engaged, throughout southeast Asia, and arrived in Bangkok. And
                    because she had known the British ambassador when he was Consul General in
                    Chicago (in fact he had courted Berti McCormick's daughter), there was a close
                    family tie there. She chose to stay at the British ambassador's residence,
                    instead of the American ambassador's residence. Now, Max Bishop, being an
                    ambitious, arch-conservative officer, was very upset that he was denied the
                    opportunity to host the owner of the arch-conservative Chicago Tribune. The
                    British ambassador, Sir Barkley Gage, had a dinner for her. My late wife was a
                    friend of Sir Barkley's wife (who was a good deal younger than he was, and had
                    been a Northwestern student when he met her). So there we are at the dinner
                    party, when at the dinner a discussion started at the table about China—Mrs.
                    McCormick had decided she was going to go in to the Mainland. Americans were
                    discouraged from traveling to the Mainland, and certainly a high profile
                    American like the owner of the Chicago Tribune. Bishop felt she would be giving
                    political recognition to the “gang of rogues who were running Red China.” So at
                    dinner, in front of everybody, he said, “I forbid you to go to China.” And Mrs.
                    McCormick looked at him like he was out of his mind, and said, “I find that
                    amusing. Who the hell are you to tell me where to go? You work for me, I don't
                    work for you, you're the ambassador and my taxes pay your salary, and don't you
                    forget it young man.” Bishop was undaunted by this and continued to argue the
                    case. In the final analysis of course, she went, and when she arrived back in
                    Chicago she wrote a front page article which was carried in the Tribune, which
                    started out by saying, “The American ambassador in Bangkok might be a good
                    plumber but he's a lousy diplomat,” and then launched into this long discussion
                    of how he was paranoid, etc., etc. Not long after that Bishop was out of there.
                    A very interesting episode to observe as a young Foreign Service officer.</p>
                <p>I had a marvelous experience with Eleanor Roosevelt in Bangkok. There is
                    something called the World Federation of United Nations Association, which is
                    still extant. They have an annual conference. And this particular year they held
                    the conference in Bangkok, and because Eleanor Roosevelt was regarded as the
                    “Mother of the United Nations” she was held in tremendous universal respect and
                    affection for her role in promoting the United Nations, particularly right after
                    her husband died. She was invited to be the number one guest at this event. The
                    U.S. delegation, which was always a “Presidential delegation” appointed by the
                    White House, was as usual, full of political contributors, most of whom didn't
                    have a whit of knowledge as to why they were going to the conference. They were
                    just going out to buy silk from Jim Thompson, and see the area. The U.S.
                    delegation was very weak. The Mainland Chinese sent a delegation even though the
                    United Nations was officially still at war with China in Korea. They were
                    allowed in because the third world countries were already trying to cut deals
                    with the Chinese, and this was not an official government event, in theory. The
                    instructions our embassy received were to observe, assist the American
                    delegation in any way possible, but don't get involved.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Well, I met the delegation and briefed them on what was going on in Bangkok, and
                    told them a little bit about the conference. I met Mrs. Roosevelt and expressed
                    my admiration. And she said, “You know I'm not part of the American delegation,
                    but I appreciate your support.” The first thing I know on the first day of the
                    conference, it was clear the Chinese had organized a lot of support among the
                    Third Worlders, including the Indonesians and the Egyptians, and they were going
                    to be voted in as full members of the World Federation, and the Taiwanese were
                    going to be forced out. This would have been a major step toward recognition of
                    the regime which was still officially at war with the United Nations. I
                    recognized that this was, notwithstanding that the American delegation was
                    so-called unofficial, an important setback for American policy.</p>
                <p>So I went to see Norbert, and he said, “By all means get in the middle of it,
                    ignore your instructions, get into it.” So I met with the American delegation. I
                    early on decided they were pretty hopeless, but I did run around working on the
                    various ambassadors who were in Bangkok, the Belgian, the Israeli
                    representative, and the German, and the Frenchman, and put together a little
                    coalition of delegations which would speak against this, and try and head it
                    off. Well, it came down to the third day to a vote on the subject, and it looked
                    like they had the votes and we didn't.</p>
                <p>Operating without any instructions, but with Norbert's blessing, I went to see
                    Mrs. Roosevelt who was sitting in a panel of academics. I called her out of the
                    meeting and we sat down on a bench out in front of the meeting place. And I
                    explained to her what was happening, and she looked at me very coolly and said,
                    “Well, what do you think we should do?” And I said, “Mrs. Roosevelt, I have no
                    right to ask you to do this, I have no authorization from the State Department
                    to do it, but if you agree with me that this would be a setback for the United
                    States, and would damage the United Nations and its reputation in the United
                    States, particularly at this tense time in the United States where the
                    extremists are denouncing the UN as being a bunch of communists anyhow, I would
                    like to suggest that if you would proceed down to the General Assembly meeting
                    place, and ask for the floor. Out of deference to you personally, they would
                    give you the microphone.” She said, “I see that and I agree, and what do you
                    think I should say?” So I said, “I'm just a junior Foreign Service officer here,
                    but if I were you, you might want to consider the following because I think you
                    might be able to move these delegations to support you. I have already lined up
                    the Thai delegation.” The deputy Foreign Minister was a good friend of mine, as
                    well as the Belgians and the Israelis, and several others to lead an effort to
                    bring about an amendment which would strike this proposal to make the Red
                    Chinese members. “But it would take a catalyst like your personal intervention.”
                    And she looked at me and said, “Young man, take my arm.”</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>At this point it was 1955, Eleanor Roosevelt had to be 75 years old, very heavy
                    set, and she was feeling the heat. I took her arm and we carefully wended our
                    way down the stairs, and Mrs. Roosevelt worked her way toward the front, and
                    waved to the podium and said, “I wonder if I might have a word?” And the
                    chairman immediately lit up and began...of course. At this point all the men who
                    were engineering the effort to bring the Red Chinese in realized what might be
                    happening, and they were scurrying around trying to persuade him not to let
                    Eleanor Roosevelt speak. Well, there wasn't any way that they were going to say
                    no to Eleanor Roosevelt. She kept right on walking toward the podium. She was
                    such a dominating figure in the United Nation's culture that of course she got
                    the microphone, and she gave a hell of a barn-burning speech. She denounced the
                    Chinese for continuing to remain in a state of war with the United Nations, and
                    rejected as ridiculous any suggestion that the World Federation of the United
                    Nations associations should accept them into their membership. At which point
                    the Thai representative stood up, followed by the Israeli and the Belgian and
                    the German, to support Mrs. Roosevelt. And finally the American delegation
                    leader (it was some producer from Hollywood), stood up and said, “Yeah, we
                    agree, we agree.”</p>
                <p>Anyhow the Red Chinese initiative was killed. It was a great tribute to Eleanor
                    Roosevelt. I cherish the photograph I have of her with me at that time. She was
                    a great American, and a great political figure. That was a very exciting thing
                    to experience, and I got a nice commendation from the Department for ignoring my
                    instructions, and a big pat on the back from Norbert which I also cherish
                    because I continue to feel that Norbert Anschutz was a truly great Foreign
                    Service officer.</p>
                <p>When we first moved into our house, fresh from Germany, it was a house built up
                    on stilts, a lot of water around. With our Airedale patrolling the fence of the
                    enclosure, he quickly stirred up what turned out to be two cobras. It was a very
                    interesting experience, and he barked and fortunately he backed away so they
                    weren't able to strike him, but they were trying to strike him. And because he
                    made such a big racket, the snakes all left. He became the de-snaking
                    instrument. Thereafter, we were known as the house of the big dog. They had
                    never seen a wooly dog because all the dogs in that part of the world are
                    short-haired, and here's this big wooly Airedale.</p>
                <p>The other thing with that Airedale that was fun was that he had to be trimmed all
                    the time to keep him from being terribly uncomfortable in the heat. The only
                    place I found where we could have this done was the Thai army cavalry
                    veterinarian. I would take him over there to the stables and with two sergeants
                    we'd take these big clippers out which were used to trim horses, and give him a
                    haircut, and that was kind of fun. I developed a special friendship with a very
                    unusual group of people.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The political situation in Bangkok was very interesting. Phibun Songgram was the
                    Prime Minister. He'd been a general, and seized power in a coup where he
                    replaced an admiral who had also come to power as a result of a coup. He was a
                    very small, delicate man, very pleasant. He was Prime Minister and remained
                    Prime Minister only because the two real power centers, the police and the army,
                    found him mutually acceptable. They were determined that the other one wouldn't
                    get power, so Phibun was propped up by competing political forces. They weren't
                    political competitors in the sense one wasn't liberal and one wasn't
                    conservative. Neither one of them were particularly soft on communism, or tough
                    on communism. They were businessmen, and somewhat like today's Mafia. CIA was
                    very heavily involved with the director of the police, General Phao, who among
                    other things ran the opium business. And our army unit, the military assistance
                    group, which was very large, and was providing equipment and training for the
                    Thai military, again going back to the days of Wild Bill Donovan trying to
                    create an effective army to contain Chinese aggression, was headed by General
                    Sarit. Now Sarit's power came from his control of the whore houses, the pork
                    business, and the liquor business. So they each had their economic bases, and
                    each had a lot of bodyguards, and they each had—thanks to CIA—their own air
                    force, navy, etc. They were two competing military forces. Both, in my judgment,
                    were milking the United States for all the assistance that they could get,
                    competing with one another, but supporting Phibun in the middle. On balance,
                    this wasn't too bad for the United States because the Thai were extremely
                    cooperative with us in the United Nations. They played along with our
                    anti-Chinese policy, although in fact they maintained their own channels to
                    Beijing. And they kept a very strong public association with Taiwan. They hosted
                    SEATO. SEATO headquarters was established there. And they did basically what the
                    Thai have been doing for centuries. They collaborated with whomever they had to
                    collaborate with to remain independent. Thai means Land of the Free, and even
                    though they were nominally occupied by the Japanese, they maintained their own
                    government, and they played along with the Japanese while at the same time they
                    played along with the OSS, and the Jim Thompsons from the U.S. They were very
                    clever that way, but it was very interesting for a western oriented Foreign
                    Service officer to see the subtlety, and the Byzantine nature of politics and
                    power in Thailand.</p>
                <p>I had, among other things, responsibility for the Thai-Malay border area in terms
                    of the political section's coverage of it. So I traveled down to the Thai-Malay
                    border and rode in helicopters along the border with the CIA-trained border
                    police who were trying to prevent the communist terrorist in Malaya from coming
                    across.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the time of the confrontation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right. I had good relations with the British officers who were
                    assigned to the Malay border police units, and we developed cooperation between
                    the Thai and the Malay along the border for which CIA deserves a lot of credit,
                    and I made a small contribution. It was interesting because there was shooting
                    going on down there—I should have gotten combat pay. But I enjoyed it, I learned
                    a lot, and saw a lot.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Another “hot area,” of course, was Vietnam. With my wife—not with the children—we
                    drove in our convertible Ford to Saigon and stayed with friends there. We
                    stopped at Phnom Penh, went to Angkor Wat and saw the ruins. At that time Diem
                    was running south Vietnam, and it was taking off economically. It was very
                    successful. It was peaceful in the countryside. I think Diem's success, and the
                    dramatic success of the private sector business economy that was organized
                    there, drove the Viet Minh in the north to launch the attack because they
                    clearly were losing the economic contest. They saw that the tide of history was
                    running against them, and they had to intervene to reverse that. So not long
                    after we left real shooting broke out, etc. There was intense, dramatic
                    political back-and-forth going on in Saigon in the embassy and we had a large
                    delegation there already.</p>
                <p>“Lightning Joe” Collins, the World War II general, was made ambassador to Saigon
                    by General Eisenhower. We had a number of people there, subsequently Henry Cabot
                    Lodge, who made very serious misjudgments, and contributed to the eventual
                    morass into which we slipped, and one of the great disasters in our history—our
                    participation in the Vietnam war.</p>
                <p>Collins did understand the importance of maintaining a clear wall between
                    permitting American forces to engage in combat as opposed to have them just
                    there as training forces. He deserves great credit for that. Cabot Lodge on the
                    other hand was there when, particularly in the Kennedy years subsequently when
                    Bobby Kennedy, with McNamara's active support, engaged in policies which led us
                    into combat, and eventually led to our defeat, and I think history is going to
                    be very harsh with them for the arrogance which they displayed in dealing with
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from the officers at the embassy in
                        Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>JENKINS: I had several friends in our embassy in Saigon. The embassy was split.
                    The main thrust—Donald Heath was the ambassador initially before Collins, and he
                    had been a very pro-Paris Point of view. Anything we needed to do to keep the
                    French in NATO, we should do, and if ignoring the Vietnamese and talking only
                    through the French to Vietnamese is necessary, that's what we should do. The DCM
                    was a terrific FSO named Ed Gullion, who subsequently went on to become an
                    ambassador in his own right. Ed was for pushing very hard for our getting
                    directly engaged with Vietnamese nationalists, including the Viet Minh who many
                    specialists believed were up on the fence at that time. They wanted very much to
                    have a relationship with the United States. I think history has proven that they
                    were not in China's pocket, that they were independent-minded and that we did
                    not have to have a situation where the Vietnamese independence movement would be
                    taken over by the communists. Ho Chi Minh would not necessarily have been
                    hostile to the best interests of the United States. Gullion had figured all that
                    out. With him was the head of CIA and the A.I.D. director, Heath, and Bill
                    Leonhart, who went on to be ambassador to Yugoslavia, were opposed to any
                    independent action. He and Heath dominated the process obviously, and they had
                    the rank. However, the minute Heath would go away on vacation, or left to go
                    home, Gullion started firing off policy telegrams questioning the wisdom of
                    where we were headed. He never did succeed in changing the policy. A very
                    interesting novel was written about this called Forest of Tigers by Robert
                    Shaplen. It's a novelization of this dispute within the embassy. It's well done,
                    a real little gem, and for anybody interested in the history of our engagement
                    in Vietnam, I would highly recommend it.</p>
                <p>I found the whole time in Bangkok very educational. I did suffer personally in
                    the sense that I had typhoid fever. And I had obviously gotten it from traveling
                    up country. I did a good deal of upcountry traveling. We were engaged in an
                    anti-communist program called the democratization drive. We would go out with
                    our Thai local employees in Jeeps, and take pictures of the King and the U.S.
                    constitution. It was a fairly simplistic—and I think the Thai were all somewhat
                    bemused by our actions, although they were very hospitable and they always
                    enjoyed parties, etc. So I had a lot of dinners with governors which is always
                    quite interesting, chicken was sort of the up-market thing to be eating, so
                    they'd always have some chicken and rice, and so on, and we'd drink a lot of
                    rice wine. They were very taken with refrigerators, and German beer. So the
                    governor would typically have in his living room a Westinghouse refrigerator
                    full of German beer or Carlsburg, which they called Catchyburg. After dinner
                    we'd all drink cognac. That was another big favorite of theirs, the French
                    influence was very significant in that sense. Cognac was very popular. We'd be
                    sitting around having cognac and in would come four or five Chinese dancing
                    girls, and the tradition was that after a few dances and more cognac, that we
                    were supposed to go off to a bedroom with our Chinese girl. That was part of the
                    dinner, “the dessert.” Of course, I was always able to wiggle out of that, but
                    it wasn't easy, it took some diplomacy. I was either sick...I came up with all
                    kinds of excuses. It became a great joke, and my wife, “C” used to tease me
                    about whether I was enjoying “dessert.”</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Typhoid was no joke—I damned near died and went down to 120 pounds before they
                    finally diagnosed it properly. There were a couple of good Harvard-trained Thai
                    doctors there and they stumbled onto it looking for Dengue fever. Once they did
                    that, there was a new drug called Chloromycetin, and within 24 hours it broke
                    the fever. Then I had four months of recovery. It was a tough time for me. I
                    arrived home weighing about 125, and that also colored my experience.</p>
                <p>Thailand was a charming country. In those days they had not paved over all the
                    khlongs or waterways. I gather it's pretty well destroyed its cultural identity
                    today. The after-effects of the Vietnam war where Bangkok became the rest and
                    recreation center for tens of thousands of American troops were severe. But the
                    Royal Bangkok Sports Club remains a happy memory in my mind, very plush, very
                    attractive, a race course, tennis courts, golf course, set up very much in the
                    British tradition, linen-jacketed waiters, bare foot, and brass buttons. It was
                    a neat place to be and a lot of fun. Playing golf was quite unique. We had a
                    caddy carry the bag, and then we had a so-called khlong caddy. Half the time you
                    were going in the water because the golf course was laced with these canals, and
                    the place was full of snakes. And their job was to kill the snakes, make sure
                    you could address the ball without stepping on a cobra. You come out of Germany
                    after five years, and it's a whole new experience. So that was kind of fun, and
                    it was a happy assignment all-in-all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to the SEATO time. You were there at the
                        creation, you were part of the apparatchiks who were putting this thing
                        together. What was your initial, and particularly the young and maybe some
                        of the older people, but the people who had to put this thing together the
                        politicians, who said this is what its going to be, about Pakistan. Because
                        there's been a lot of debate about, all of a sudden Pakistan got roped into
                        it. It was supposed to be the bridge, but Pakistan...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: We wanted India to be a member but they refused to participate because
                    they were a leader of the neutral Bandung group. They were instrumental in
                    pushing the Chinese for membership, for example. The Paks came in because they
                    were responsive to us and it was something that would set them apart from India.
                    It was a way of getting close to the U.S. on a military to military basis.
                    Pakistan was a military-run country. Burma didn't come in for example. Burma was
                    with India on this. But Pakistan provided more muscle than anybody to SEATO, so
                    far as SEATO had any substance, I would say it was the Pakistanis who provided
                    it. Obviously the British, Australians, and Americans did, but for an Asian
                    ingredient, even though they were south Asian, not southeast Asian, their
                    officers were splendid, Sandhurst graduates, and splendid men. We really enjoyed
                    them a lot, and they did a hell of a job.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>We had one operation in Bangkok to sort of kickoff SEATO's existence, called
                    Operation Firm Link. Firm Link included an airdrop and a naval landing combined
                    exercise to demonstrate SEATO's ability to inject force onto the Asian mainland
                    if needed. We had 5,000 paratroopers come from the Philippines. The Pakistanis
                    had a couple of airborne battalions. We had jets that swooped low, and the navy
                    came in, the New Zealand navy came, and the Australians had some troops with
                    their wonderful bush hats, etc., and all these guys landed at the airport where
                    there's a huge flat field which went on for miles, without accident, very
                    effective operation. We had big parades through Bangkok and a lot of press
                    coverage, etc. It was fun. But when we thought about how we were trying to
                    impress the Chinese with their millions of men, it was kind of thin, not
                    substance. We did the best we could. We had doubts as to whether it was going to
                    have any impact. Certainly the Thai were heartened by it, it reinforced their
                    commitment to stay with the West. The Pakistanis were trying desperately to stay
                    with the West anyway they could. The Malays were very good. We had Cambodian and
                    Vietnamese association with SEATO, although they weren't active participants,
                    they sent a lot of observers. And I think Dulles was happy with that. Given the
                    interpretation of the world at that time, it was a pretty reasonable and
                    effective thing to do. Whether that interpretation was real is unclear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you and the people at the embassy concerned about the
                        possibility of a confrontation, a Chinese uprising in Thailand at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: No. It's odd. I think that's true throughout southeast Asia, although
                    the Chinese controlled business, and much of the finance of that part of the
                    world, they never seemed to try to get control of politics. If the Mainland
                    Chinese had invaded, obviously, these Chinese would have collaborated with them
                    to a large extent. A Hong Kong-like takeover was always a possibility, and we
                    were always concerned that the Thai not feel that time was on the Chinese side
                    because they would start to adapt in advance. We used to say that political reed
                    watching is the order of the day. If the wind is blowing in a certain direction,
                    they'll be there. We tried to maintain a prevailing breeze in our direction, and
                    to some degree we succeeded with things like Firm Link, the SEATO operation.
                    There was a lot of anti-Chinese sentiment, like anti-Semitism in this country.
                    Historically the Thai would complain socially and privately to you that the
                    Chinese control all the money, but they didn't hesitate to collaborate, to
                    accept directorships, go on the board, marry Chinese, to get their hands on the
                    money. Not very noble, but very realistic in a sense. The Thai have always felt
                    that they were a small country, that they were impotent, but very clever, and
                    they were going to survive through being clever. They dealt with the Chinese the
                    same way. Not long after I left, in Indonesia after the overthrow of Sukarno,
                    Suharto came to power and under him they slaughtered about 800,000 Chinese. That
                    figure may be inflated but I think those were the numbers used.</p>

                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>JENKINS: That never happened in Thailand, and it never will. The Thai were
                    political warriors. They dealt with Pol Pot, for example, in Cambodia. They do
                    business with people, and they draw you into a relationship. That's their way of
                    resistance. And who's to argue with it? Its worked for them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left there, whither Thailand? What was your

                        Cold War. China is a great menace, and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Oh yes, very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, I thought on leaving, that we had made progress, that we'd
                    supported the Thai. The Thai were desperate to maintain their independence,
                    recognized that we were available, and that we were probably reliable. What was
                    clear by 1956 is that things were coming unraveled in Indochina, gradually but
                    clearly. That was distressing. And in Saigon, for example, half the city was
                    Chinese and they were all working with the Mainland. What we didn't appreciate,
                    and I don't think any American analyst did, except true experts who were too
                    junior to have any impact on policy, was that the Vietnamese hated the Chinese
                    and vice versa. It didn't matter whether they were communists or
                    anti-communists, we were dealing with a national attitude and mentality. And I
                    think that was true in Thailand, true in Burma. It's true throughout Southeast
                    Asia, and it's logical. It shouldn't have been too hard for Americans to figure
                    out that nationalism was driving politics. For ideological reasons Dulles was
                    really miscast in this whole picture. “Wild Bill” Donovan was very naughty, and
                    I think we missed the opportunity, not only to undercut communist influence in
                    southeast Asia by dealing with and exploiting the nationalist thrust, but
                    ignoring the fact that within China itself nationalism was a key element. I
                    think the China language officers who were literally driven from the Service,
                    were heroes, they were right, and they had the courage to say it, and they paid
                    a terrible price. And I'll never forgive Eisenhower as President for caving in
                    to the Joe McCarthys of the world who were dominating our domestic policy. He
                    certainly was a great leader in World War II, but not as a President. I found
                    much about Eisenhower that I find about Clinton, reed watching, compromising,
                    bending to the pressures, no clear agenda. Dulles, to his credit, had an agenda.
                    It happened to be wrong, his picture of the enemy was wrong. He saw the Soviets
                    as six feet tall, and us as 5'4”, and it was exactly the opposite in the real
                    world and history will show that, will confirm that. I felt that Thailand was on
                    a pretty good track, and I left feeling that things were going to move ahead. In
                    fact, as you look at it, Thailand has not really suffered a serious reversal.
                    Even the loss of Vietnam didn't really damage the Thai. They are remarkable
                    survivors. They made a lot of money out of the Vietnam war, they got a lot of
                    commitments out of us. Their military got a lot of equipment, they got a lot of
                    jobs, they paved a lot of roads, a lot of whore houses made a lot of money. And
                    the net result of the whole thing was Vietnam was destroyed, decimated. We
                    created a tremendous domestic crises in our own country, but nobody ever laid a
                    glove on the Thai.—end of insert.</p>
                <p>After these two eventful and, in retrospect, historic years in Bangkok, we
                    returned home to Washington via Lake Bluff, Illinois, where we spent our home
                    leave (2 months). “C's” parents lived there. Home leave is meant to be a time of
                    regeneration and it was — especially for me returning at 125 lbs. after typhoid
                    fever. C's family were marvelous, supportive people and loved their
                    grandchildren. There was a cold-shower impact on us, however, to feel the
                    palpable suspicion among C's school friends and their families towards the State
                    Department and us — a sour left-over from Senator McCarthy's empty but
                    scurrilous attacks on the Department.</p>

                <p>While there we learned that we had been selected for Russian area language study
                    — 9 months of intensive (8 hours a day, everyday) language training at the
                    Foreign Service Institute and then, two semesters at Harvard's Russian
                    Institute. The language training was very wearing — a small room with no
                    windows, four other “students” and a native Russian speaker.</p>
                <p>While the language program was tough, it was really effective. The State
                    Department language program is under-appreciated by the general public, but in
                    my experience and diplomatic service around the world, our embassy officers are
                    clearly better prepared to deal with native languages at the post where they
                    serve than any other Embassies. The language program assumes no intelligence on
                    the part of the student and uses a system which teaches language by sound, as a
                    young child learns to speak.</p>
                <p>After this intense interlude, we decamped for a fascinating two semesters at
                    Harvard. I had long been awed by Harvard's reputation. As time went on, I found
                    at Notre Dame and George Washington and in competition with Ivy League
                    graduates, that Bowling Green had not really disadvantaged me. However, Harvard
                    is truly something special. I was even more awestruck after coming to know
                    Harvard than before I got there. I had the great opportunity to study with men
                    like Marshall Shulman, who had been Dean Acheson's special assistant in the
                    Department when I first started in 1950 and returned to be President Carter's
                    principal advisor on Soviet affairs. Marshall was a fascinating and wonderful
                    man and I learned a great deal from him. I also had two semesters with Zbig
                    Brzezinski and Rickard Pipes, both of whom became National Security Council
                    Advisors; William Langer, one of the premiere historians in the United States,
                    who taught a magnificent two-semester course on the history of the Ottoman
                    empire, which of course was central to Russian history; and the very impressive
                    Dean of professors on the Soviet economy, Abe Bergson. On those occasions when
                    we had a spare moment, we also were encouraged to host informal dinner parties
                    at the alumni club where for example, we spent an evening with Henry Kissinger.
                    All in all, our group of four Russian language students had a fascinating and
                    very productive academic year at Harvard.</p>
                <p>I must add that for my wife, it was slightly less than fascinating! With no help,
                    a third-floor walk-up apartment on campus, my wife spent the long days coping
                    with two in diapers and one in nursery school. A Siberia-like experience for
                    which she felt compensated when we landed at our next post in Berlin.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>The Berlin experience quickly became even more exciting as in October of 1959,
                    the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, in a speech, announced that the legal
                    basis of Western presence in Berlin had expired. The chief of our division, the
                    late Howard Trivers, a superb scholar of German history, quickly picked up on
                    the Ulbricht speech, and we began a series of messages back to Washington,
                    sounding the alarm bell that the Soviets clearly were in the process of
                    launching an attack upon our basic legal right to remain in Berlin. Crisis after
                    crisis cascaded from that time. East Germans began to substitute for Soviet
                    officers at checkpoints in an effort to force us to recognize their sovereignty
                    and the division of Germany. Harassment of our convoys in the Berlin corridor
                    increased regularly. The elevated train system, which ran throughout the city in
                    one of the anachronisms of the otherwise divided Berlin was maintained in East
                    Berlin. The S-Bahn, as they were called, began to appear in West Berlin with
                    flags of the so-called East German Democratic Republic on them. This led to
                    action on our part to stop the trains and remove the East German flags before
                    they could proceed. Guards at the checkpoints in the presence of the Soviet
                    officials would attempt to stamp East German visas into our passports. While
                    these may seem petty, they were all part of clearly calculated policy to
                    “salami-slice” the Western presence in Berlin.</p>
                <p>Underlying this decision and the timing of the effort was the fact that the
                    Soviet-sponsored regime in East Germany was a complete failure in governing its
                    section of Germany. Living standards dropped as living standards in the West
                    rose. The refugee flow from East Germany through Berlin to West Germany steadily
                    increased until it reached a flood in 1959. It became increasingly apparent to
                    us that the Soviets had to act to stop the depopulation of East Germany if they
                    were not to lose total control over one of the gems of their empire.</p>
                <p>The desperateness of their situation was dramatized by the particularly severe
                    rate of departure by qualified doctors from East Germany. One of the things
                    which I undertook in our political section was to monitor the refugee flow and
                    attempt to compile statistics on the flow of doctors. I was helped in this by
                    the opportunity to interview doctors who were living in West Berlin and by the
                    presence of a fiancee of the New York Times representative David Binder in East
                    Berlin's top hospital. David shared this information with me as I shared with
                    him our views of political significance of this flow. There were states in the
                    Soviet zone of Germany which in fact were virtually without doctors. You can
                    imagine the psychological impact on the population to see all their doctors
                    leave. In a desperate effort the Soviets even began to import Vietnamese and
                    Bulgarian doctors as an emergency measure, which had an even more dramatic
                    negative effect on the East German population.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>While we concentrated on alerting Washington to the dramatic changes we saw
                    unfolding in our exposed position in Berlin, we also tried to stay on top of
                    attitudes in West Berlin and in the East German population in every way possible
                    in addition to monitoring the flight of doctors. Together with my British
                    colleague, the late James Bennett, and my French colleague, Xavier De Nazelle,
                    we would attend open air district political communist rallies in the parks in
                    East Berlin where we witnessed the population attacking party spokesmen for the
                    dramatic deterioration of the situation and the contrast between their situation
                    and the steadily rising standard of living in West.</p>
                <p>On one occasion, when James and I walked into an outdoor restaurant where the
                    local party was holding such a rally, the security goons who always tailed us as
                    we went into East Berlin stepped to the dais where an East German party leader
                    was speaking, with a note. He read it, stopped and said, “I understand that we
                    are honored by the presence of representatives of the U.S. and British missions
                    tonight. I wonder if they would like to come forth and contribute to our
                    conversation?” It was indeed tempting, but “exercising uncharacteristic
                    restraint,” James and I decided it was better to sit tight, drink our beer and
                    wait for the program to go on than to take this unsolicited opportunity to
                    present Western views to an audience, which probably would have led to our being
                    physically thrown out!</p>
                <p>The freedom to move in East Berlin after going through a checkpoint, even though
                    we were followed, led to several very interesting experiences. When Khrushchev
                    came to Berlin to speak to reiterate his ultimatum and turn up the heat on our
                    presence in West Berlin, he spoke at an open air gathering of tens of thousands
                    in Alexander Platz. Once again, James and I had driven through the checkpoint
                    and then taken to foot to walk to where the rally was going to occur. There were
                    East German police everywhere, questioning the right of people to participate.
                    We feigned ignorance of German and kept emphasizing that we were there from the
                    United States and England to witness this historic event. We finally had worked
                    our way to within a few hundred yards of the platform from where Khrushchev
                    would speak when a particularly hostile police guard stopped us cold and said
                    “no one may pass beyond this point without special identification.” Sort of as a
                    lark, James and I took out our PX cards and held them up to the man who to our
                    astonishment displayed the traditional German respect for documents and without
                    understanding what he was observing, waved us through. The result was that we
                    stood in the second row right in front of Khrushchev and observed the interplay
                    between Ulbricht and other officials on the platform as Khrushchev spoke.
                    Khrushchev was a dramatic and even theatrical speaker. His voice was shrill and
                    threatening as he denounced the Western presence in Berlin as illegal and
                    declared that we had six months to depart or take the consequences. The nervous
                    excitement of his East German minion on the dais with Khrushchev was palpable.
                    Needless to say, this made for interesting reporting telegrams back to
                    Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Perhaps the most dramatic confrontation of this period occurred slightly later
                    when East German guards, in an effort to force our acknowledgment of the
                    so-called German Democratic Republic and its sovereignty over West Berlin,
                    instead of just harassing our army convoys, actually seized one on the autobahn.
                    Since each of these convoys was equipped with a radio, we received word in the
                    mission almost immediately. The convoy leader reported that instead of just
                    being delayed, the East Germans were in the process of taking possession of our
                    six-truck convoy. General Hamlet instructed the officer in charge of the convoy
                    to sit fast in the truck and refuse to leave, which they did. The East Germans
                    stood on the running boards outside the truck, but did not attempt to use force
                    to evict the American soldiers who were driving them. This deadlock continued
                    for several hours. Meanwhile, General Hamlet and Minister Al Lightner were on
                    the phone to Washington and Bonn as were their French and British
                    colleagues.</p>
                <p>From where we sat in Berlin, this was clearly one more desperate effort by Moscow
                    to frighten us out of our rightful position in West Berlin. In Washington, the
                    situation quickly created near panic and anxiety that general war could erupt
                    over such an incident. General Hamlet called together the mission team and we
                    debated for a short time what to do. Meanwhile the call of nature was having a
                    predictable effect on the beleaguered American soldiers in the trucks and it was
                    clear that they could not hold out indefinitely. Abandoning the trucks would
                    constitute the first acceptance by the West of the suggestion that we did not
                    have a full legal right not only to be in West Berlin, but to transverse the
                    autobahn from West Germany to West Berlin to sustain our presence there. It was
                    decided that Findley Burns, who was the number three man in the U.S. mission, a
                    career diplomat, should go to Karlshorst at Soviet headquarters with two
                    military officers and a Russian-American enlisted man, as an interpreter, to
                    present a demarche to the Soviets: If the trucks were not released within two
                    hours, we would use force to retrieve them. And, bless his courage, while
                    Washington continued to debate nervously, General Hamlet instructed our tank
                    units to load up with live ammunition, start their motors, begin to assemble to
                    drive down the autobahn to free the U.S. convoy. This action, arming the tanks
                    with live ammunition and moving them out of their assembly point toward the
                    autobahn was, of course, closely observed and reported on by Moscow spies who
                    monitored all of our military activities in Berlin constantly. Faced with the
                    threat of the use of force, the Soviets backed down, the trucks were released
                    and the convoy continued. Subsequently, we filed a very strong protest with
                    Karlshorst, in Moscow, and with the Soviet embassy in Washington warning them
                    against such irresponsible and dangerous activity in the future. For the time
                    being, our point had been made. The Russians had to allow for the possibility
                    that we might actually risk war in order to maintain our rights. It was this
                    perception which was central to our ability to remain in Berlin over subsequent
                    years until in fact the wall eventually came down.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Throughout the two years we were in Berlin, there was an uneasy relationship
                    between the mission, Bonn and more so Washington and as well between our British
                    and French colleagues and their respective foreign offices at home. We were
                    convinced almost viscerally that the name of the game in Berlin was willpower.
                    If the Soviets we felt were persuaded that we could be threatened and forced out
                    of Berlin or that we would lose our determination for the long pull they could
                    by salami slice tactics wear away our rights and our determination to maintain
                    our position. The net result if they were successful would have been the
                    permanent advance of the border Soviet empire and help persuade our allies that
                    our commitment to Europe would not stand the test of time. We saw several policy
                    debates in Washington particularly when John Foster Dulles was the Secretary
                    which led us to believe that the reliability of the U.S. commitment to Berlin
                    was in question. Dulles, an astute corporate lawyer, seemed to be seeking always
                    a legal means of reducing our engagement and eventually extricating ourselves
                    from “an indefensible position.” When the Kennedy Administration arrived, we
                    began to feel this same unease even though the indications we were receiving
                    were clothed in more liberal and internationalist tone the statements by White
                    House officials including those closest to Kennedy persuaded us that the Kennedy
                    Administration was even more dedicated to extricating the United States from our
                    commitment in Berlin than Dulles had been. We felt that somehow our strong
                    consistent political reporting was simply being ignored by the White House and
                    those around him who, as so often is the case in the last 50 years, tended to
                    ignore the State Department experts and rely on the brilliance of White House
                    staff who were frequently under-informed about real conditions. Cleverness
                    seemed to rate a higher priority than reliability. One of the tactics which we
                    evolved almost by happenstance to deal with this was to develop our own channels
                    of communication. In my case, I built a very close friendship with Dr. Otto
                    Frei, a highly respected Berlin reporter for the equally highly respected NZZ, a
                    Swiss newspaper which is probably the most respected paper in Europe even today.
                    Among other things the NZZ we knew was read first thing every morning by
                    Germany's Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer. Thus while we might have trouble
                    persuading our own government in Washington to stand tough occasionally and our
                    British colleagues were wringing their hands over the waffling nature of the
                    then British government. (This was before Lord Hume became foreign minister.)
                    Then the French were never quite certain where de Gaulle was standing (although
                    it was usually very solid and very helpful), we were able by working with Otto
                    Frei to communicate our views about developments in Berlin directly to the
                    German Chancellor. This may seem a bit irreverent if not worse but in fact we of
                    course did not divulge classified information while we did engage in mutual
                    discussions with Frei about our assessment of Soviet and East German intentions
                    and activities and in return received from Frei very impressive and timely
                    assessments of the attitudes in West Berlin and among Western correspondents.
                    The net result of this was that when a four power discussion would take place on
                    how to deal with the latest salami slice initiative by Moscow, Adenauer would
                    always be up to speed on our view and assessments of those actions and
                    vigorously defend standing fast in the face of the Soviet threat. This was heady
                    stuff. We of course kept our direct superiors informed of the discussions we had
                    with Frei but basically it was in many ways the most effective communications
                    channel that we had.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>One of the great luxuries of living in Berlin in addition to the excellent
                    restaurants and the very hospitable and friendly population and first class
                    cultural activities was the existence of two top flight tennis clubs. As a
                    tennis enthusiast, I always tried to actively participate in a tennis club at
                    each of my assignments and throughout my German assignments this was a very
                    successful way both with an unusual slice of German society. In Berlin I joined
                    the Rot—Weiss Tennis Club and became a member of the club team with whom I
                    journeyed to Western Germany to play matches against other teams. We became
                    close friends, the members of the team and I had the pleasure of regular tennis
                    at one of the premiere tennis clubs in Europe.</p>
                <p>Earlier I had done this in Munich, Hannover and Hamburg. In Hannover where (the
                    club rank list had) the top members began with Baron Von Cramm and included
                    three other Davis Cup historic players, I landed at number eight. I always had
                    to explain that there was a tremendous gap in quality between number four and
                    number five and even between seven and eight, but nonetheless I was on the
                    ladder with four famous German players. There, too, we had great fun traveling
                    to matches against other clubs and had the pleasure of playing on first class
                    facilities.</p>
                <p>I also knew a lot of people in the British intelligence section because they were
                    all dealing with East Germany and I was a source of information for them, and
                    they for me. Oddly enough, there was a famous British turncoat whom we knew, and
                    whom we once entertained in our house, James Blake.</p>
                <p>Blake was caught, arrested, jailed in England, and then spirited out by KGB
                    agents from the jail. He went off to Moscow, and wrote a book. It was a famous
                    case because like Burgess and McLean, he came from this highly structured
                    society where if you were not in, you were out. The story goes that because his
                    mother was Lebanese or something, he was not socially accepted. He suffered from
                    this at university and in society. He had a very nice British wife, who was a
                    friend of my wife's. He was a handsome fellow, wore a military uniform, but he
                    was really working for Sandy Goshen, the head of British intelligence in Berlin.
                    Blake caused the death of dozens of covert agents in East Germany by identifying
                    or “fingering them” to Soviet authorities. (*No Other Choice by Geo. Blake,
                    Simon &amp; Schuster - 1990)</p>
                <p>Our best friend in Berlin, was a British captain in the tank corps who went on to
                    become the Queen's military advisor, Major General, Sir Michael Palmer. Mike and
                    I have remained close friends, we visit back and forth, our children are
                    friends, and his youngest son is my God-son. My God-son was a major in charge of
                    a tank unit in “the desert rats” in the Gulf War. His regiment is the same
                    regiment his father was in, which is the same regiment his great grandfather was
                    in, so it goes way back. So we had a great exposure to regimental life, and
                    liked that a lot.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>We also had a lot of friends in Berlin among young Berlin lawyers. The city was
                    so pro-American. When we received orders to go to Moscow, and we went out to the
                    stores we always encountered a warm reception. I took an old Harris tweed
                    overcoat in to see if I could get a fur lining for it, to wear in Moscow. I
                    walked in to this tailor whom I had dealt with but didn't know particularly,
                    told him that I had been posted to Moscow, etc., and I wondered if I could have
                    a rabbit skin lining. He said, “Absolutely.” He did a beautiful job and when I
                    went to pay for it...it was going to cost $100, a lot of money in those
                    days...he refused to accept payment. He said, “You have defended my city. You're
                    going to Moscow to continue to defend my city, it's my contribution.” And my
                    wife went in to get some jewelry, and the same thing happened to her. When
                    people learned that we were going to Moscow, and they had known what we were
                    doing in Berlin, they refused to accept payment. They were right, we were all
                    “saving Berlin.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely. Did you deal with the Soviets at all
                        yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, particularly in Potsdam, which was the headquarters of the Soviet
                    armed forces in Germany. We would go to meetings there and negotiate over people
                    such as soldiers who would wander across the border. Findley Burns, the Mission
                    Counselor, was the lead negotiator.</p>
                <p>I was also involved with the Russians in various things such as the air traffic
                    control disputes which reoccurred regularly. The Soviets were always trying to
                    lower the air corridor, harass our planes. We also had social events with
                    them.</p>
                <p>However, once Khrushchev delivered his ultimatum, it became deadly serious and
                    there was no more joking, no more socializing. With the exception of the tanks
                    and the convoy, they were all obvious harassment. They tried to use our trips
                    through the check-point to take our passport and stamp an East German visa in it
                    which would be a sort of recognition of East German sovereignty over all Berlin.
                    So we refused to show our passports. Washington, always seeking to defuse or
                    compromise confrontations insisted that we hold our passports up to the window,
                    so we had to do that. We in Berlin never wanted to give them an inch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with our military? Using military to put
                        pressure on is probably the most inexact weapon I can think of, because
                        they're not very good at this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: They don't like to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They don't like to do it, and if they do it, it can end up
                        with a master sergeant making a policy decision.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>JENKINS: In Berlin, uniquely in my experience, the integration of our mission
                    with General Hamlet's military structure was complete. And the CIA people were
                    in the middle of it. There were often arguments between naval intelligence,
                    which had a station there, army intelligence, air force intelligence, they all
                    had people there, competing with CIA. Meanwhile our political operation was
                    above this turf struggle. They all played to us to try and play their little
                    game with each other. But basically other than that kind of turf friction, it
                    was a well-knit unit. Hamlet was an excellent officer. He had two other generals
                    and several colonels—they were all outstanding. I played tennis with them and we
                    were all very close friends.</p>
                <p>Sitting in that city, surrounded by Soviet power, with a six month ultimatum to
                    get out or World War III would begin, brings you together. Our moral was
                    terrific. There was very little friction. And our military in Berlin became very
                    sophisticated in political terms, like my British friend; who became a real
                    student of Soviet affairs. There was not, in Berlin, any serious difference of
                    opinion about Soviet intentions or the necessity for firmness on our part. Now,
                    back in Washington there were major arguments about all this, and even in Bonn.
                    Our embassy in Bonn was very nervous about the Berlin Mission's strong views.
                    Fortunately we had Marty Hillenbrand in Bonn as DCM. Marty, having served in
                    Berlin had an excellent appreciation of Berlin events. But after Marty left, the
                    embassy in Bonn was not very strong on Berlin issues. But Washington drove
                    policy, and Washington was torn in many different directions. Initially the
                    problem was Dulles who was acting like a corporate lawyer, then the Kennedy
                    administration came in and we got all these smart asses in the White House, like
                    John Kenneth Galbraith, and a character who was editor of the New Yorker for a
                    while, Dick Goodwin; and Arthur Schlesinger, the historian. These people were
                    sitting around in the White House trying to figure out a way through sheer
                    intellectual brilliance to disarm this confrontation, this historic
                    confrontation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Kennedy, of course, almost came a cropper when he got
                        to Vienna, which led to all sorts of other things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: That's exactly right. It was a terrible thing. I think Khrushchev was
                    persuaded by Kennedy's performance at Vienna that his bluff was going to work.
                    And that's when the decision was made to put the missiles into Cuba.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>In '60 I went to Moscow as the Berlin officer in the political section. By this
                    time the Soviets had extended the ultimatum for another six months. While I was
                    in Moscow reporting on the Berlin situation, and engaged in the negotiations,
                    they finally withdrew the ultimatum. We knew it from an editorial in Pravda
                    where the phrase, “on that basis” was omitted. The liturgy had been that the
                    Soviet Union controls East Germany, Berlin is part of East Germany, and on that
                    basis the western powers have no right to be in Berlin. One day the Pravda
                    editorial read, “The Soviet Union controls East Germany. Berlin is located
                    within East Germany, and in our judgment...” instead of “on that basis,” the
                    Allies have no legal basis for being there. And we knew that the crisis was
                    over. I wrote the telegram to the Department flagging this. It was really
                    exciting. We still had the big crisis, access to Berlin, but the ultimatum was
                    withdrawn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this Moscow thing out of Berlin...you'd already
                        taken Russian so you had been the Russian specialist in our mission in
                        Berlin. And I assume you were kind of keeping your finger on developments in
                        Moscow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Oh, yes, very much so, and even trying to keep my Russian up in Berlin.
                    I took private lessons on the side just so I wouldn't lose fluency. When I
                    arrived in Moscow...well, I had home leave after Berlin for a month and I spent
                    that month working very hard reading Pravda, and things like that to get my
                    Russian sharpened up.</p>
                <p>We arrived, as I recall, August of 1960. It was a shock. From the air Moscow
                    looks beautiful. There had already been some light snow, oddly enough...maybe it
                    was September because I remember clearly there was some snow on the fields, not
                    much. But all the pines and the birches from the air looked beautiful. When you
                    arrived at the airport, Sheremetyevo, the international airport, it was three
                    buildings. It was and still is tacky. You hit the ground, and all of a sudden
                    you realize that “this place needs new management!” Everything was run down, the
                    two years that I lived in the Soviet Union and frequent visits thereafter, it
                    has always been one of the strongest impressions—God, this place is so badly
                    maintained. (I have not been back since Yeltsin took over.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've been reading some travel books, but also some travel
                        books of the 19th century and there does seem to be a certain thread that
                        runs through it. That the Russians maintain that they're European,
                        but...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: ...really are different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...really are different and one of the things is that they
                        don't do a lot of things very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right. The society has never provided incentives to maintain
                    things. Whereas all of western societies at various times, there have been such
                    incentive. I must admit that right now in the District we're lacking those
                    incentives, and the District is beginning to look very run down. Garbage on the
                    streets this morning, for example, because there was no pick-up yesterday, and
                    so on. But in the Soviet Union there had never been incentives. So you had these
                    beautiful architectural gems which could fit very nicely into an expensive
                    Georgetown neighborhood, but the woodwork had never been painted, and everything
                    was either rotting or peeling. The average dwelling built for one family, would
                    have four families in it. When I was there, there was a statistic which I
                    thought captured it very well: there were 18 adults for every toilet in the
                    Soviet Union. And the toilets frequently were no more than holes in the floor
                    (which takes you to Asia). And I never really learned how to squat over one of
                    those holes comfortably, so I had a lot of problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I served in the Balkans, and they were called Turkish
                        bombsights.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right, exactly. But arriving there right from the beginning we
                    ran into the other aspect of Soviet and Russian society, it's an incredible
                    bureaucracy. It wasn't evil, sort of secret police control, it was just these
                    people had about eight people doing everything that could be done by one. So
                    consequently there are eight times as many forms to fill out. We came in on
                    diplomatic passports obviously, went into the diplomatic lounge where we were
                    met by embassy staff. All that went reasonably smoothly. But we had our Airedale
                    with us. Well, the Russians had never seen an Airedale in the first place. So
                    when we arrived at the airport, they didn't know what to do. They decided he had
                    to go through customs, but we didn't have a customs declaration, and they didn't
                    have a form for a living dog. So we went back and forth. The agricultural
                    department got into it, etc., and we finally got clearance. But I would say it
                    was a three hour process, with a lot of moments in those three hours when it
                    looked like they would not allow the dog to enter the Soviet Union. Since this
                    was our pet Airedale and he had been with us for 12 years, there was no way we
                    were not going to take that dog with us.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Well, we finally got in, and then went down to the Hotel Ukraine where our
                    temporary quarters were, where we subsequently had to live for six weeks. It was
                    very difficult, the conditions were not good. As we arrived, we walked into the
                    desk, with the Airedale on the leash, and our three boys, and put our passports
                    down. They confirmed, yes, they do have a reservation for us, a suite of two
                    rooms back-to-back. And then the woman looks up and said, “Of course, we do not
                    allow dogs in the hotel.” This was a real challenge, and I must say probably in
                    my entire diplomatic career, I handled this more diplomatically than anything I
                    ever faced. A bolt of lightning came to me, and I decided, okay, this is the
                    land of non-sequiturs, here we go. I told the woman profusely, “I am so
                    impressed. Do you know on the entire European continent, the Soviet Union is
                    apparently the only country where dogs are not allowed in hotels. You are so
                    progressive, that's so sensitive to sanitary considerations,” and I had to go
                    into that, “I really take my hat off to you.” And she nodded and smiled and
                    said, “That's right. No dogs allowed in the hotel.” We picked up our passports
                    and the keys and the dog, and went right up to our room. She never said a word.
                    And as we came back out about two hours later to take the dog for a walk along
                    the Moscow River, she looked up and wagged her finger, and said, “Remember no
                    dogs.” And I said, “Yes, I do remember. I can't wait to write to tell my
                    friends.” And she beamed and nodded. For six weeks every day she would say, “No
                    dogs.” And I'd say, “Absolutely.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the concierge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: No problem with her, she didn't give a damn. She was asleep most of the
                    time anyhow. But that was a hell of an experience. Then we had one other little
                    flare-up in that period. We were walking the dog, and I didn't normally keep him
                    on a leash because he was very well trained. We were right along the edge of the
                    river, and there was about a three foot drop down into the river, and
                    occasionally there would be stairs going down where boats could tie up. Well,
                    all of a sudden the dog saw a fish, and he jumped in. The Moskva River is a
                    filthy place, covered with an oil slick. I eventually got him back out again, up
                    one of those little stair platforms. We took him back into the hotel and tried
                    to wipe him off with newspapers, and this was a little tricky. The woman at the
                    desk didn't happen to be looking. We got him up in the room and had to call the
                    embassy doctor to help us get the oil off his coat. There were three days of
                    constant bathing, and not a happy Airedale.</p>

                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Khrushchev was in. The relationship was extremely confrontational. The
                    Berlin crisis was in full flower. While shortly after we got there, and I don't
                    remember the exact dates and I have to get back and get this I suppose, we did
                    the ill-fated Bay of Pigs landing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would have been during the Kennedy time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right, a little later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...February-March of '61.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right, and it was a huge embarrassment. We had a lot of things
                    happen in the two years in Moscow which were very exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, what was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I was in the political section. The political section was divided into
                    two parts, internal and external. Dick Davies ran the internal, and he was busy
                    analyzing the Politburo, and the domestic problems, etc., and the first signs of
                    unease and unhappiness, dissension in the literary circles among the
                    intelligentsia. Khrushchev had started to loosen up internal controls. He gave
                    his famous speech at the Party Congress. The thaw had begun domestically.
                    Internationally, Khrushchev became more of a gambler, convinced that we really
                    didn't have the willpower to use our military physical power and that therefore
                    he could muscle us and expand their borders. They became very aggressive in many
                    ways, not only in the Cuban situation, but also in Africa. They founded Lumumba
                    University while I was there and they brought in a couple thousand young
                    Africans for four years of study and training. Ideally, they were supposed to go
                    back as committed Soviet agents, but most of them were so turned off by the
                    experience they went back as anti-communists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I dealt with Bulgarians around this time and the
                        Yugoslavians, the Africans in Bulgaria did not like to be called black
                        monkeys.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I can't imagine why.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...for some reason by the general population, and they up
                        and left.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, Lumumba was more or less the same experience. We had a number
                    of...I'd say hundreds of Lumumba students turn up at the USIS reading room
                    because being non-Soviets they could push their way into the Cultural Center. We
                    ended up pouring out Time magazines, and America magazines to them, and they
                    would take them back to the Lumumba building, campus-dormitory, and then from
                    there they'd spread them all over the place. So it became really a running sore
                    for the KGB and the Soviet control mechanism. These people would talk to us and
                    tell us what was happening, what was being taught. We did a number of despatches
                    on this program, and our basic assessment was that the Soviets in opening
                    Lumumba University did us a great favor, and greatly undermined their own
                    effectiveness, by bringing these people face-to-face with Soviet reality which
                    was very unattractive.</p>
                <p>I was in the external section working with Culver Gleysteen and Frank Meehan. And
                    when Frank left to go to Berlin (back to my old job), Spike Dubs replaced him.
                    So once again the Hamburg cadre of Meehan, Dubs and Jenkins were all together,
                    this time in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First, let's talk about the ambassador. Who he was, and
                        how he operated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: The ambassador was Llewellyn Thompson, who is in my judgment, the finest
                    career officer I ever had associated with. He was not a strong personality like
                    Chip Bohlen had been, he was shy and retiring, but absolutely a splendid and
                    decent man. He had a sensitivity to political realities, and the Soviet Union, a
                    very good dialogue with Khrushchev and his entire Politburo. And he had terrific
                    insights. Russia was very interested in being accepted in the world cultural
                    scene as legitimate, which she really wasn't. But we played on that, and we
                    arranged for playwrights to come from the United States under the exchanges
                    program which they tolerated because they wanted their scientists to get in and
                    steal whatever they could in terms of technology. In exchange for that we sent
                    people who had political influence into the Soviet Union. We worked with the FBI
                    to trust these Soviet scientists contained them basically. But in exchange for
                    that we did have a fairly successful flow of important Americans visiting
                    Moscow. Benny Goodman came to Moscow while I was there with his band. For three
                    nights they had concerts. The first night the audience was all invited
                    apparatchiks, and they all sat there stolidly, while Benny put on a magnificent
                    performance. The second night a lot of the intelligentsia and the younger people
                    came and they went crazy, absolutely crazy. It was a huge success. Another event
                    we had was the Michigan University marching band, where they played the Michigan
                    fight song, etc. That was put on at Lushniki sports palace where there are seats
                    for 10,000 people. The audience was packed with military people in uniform. They
                    were trying to limit the impact...well, the Michigan band is so great, that
                    these guys in uniform went wild. They were all standing up on their chairs, and
                    cheering and applauding. The band was a huge success. The appetite for things
                    western, especially American, was so dramatically revealed in things like this
                    that every time there would be a crack, we'd push something through it. I
                    subsequently was in charge of USIA's programs for five years for that part of
                    the world, and had a chance to cash in on the experience that I had in
                    Moscow.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>Khrushchev allowed this opening. In Stalin's time, none of that would be
                    permitted. He was afraid of western influence. Khrushchev seemed to realize that
                    the influence was coming and that he had to try to get ahead of the power curve.
                    He permitted things on a controlled basis which we were able to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we feel about the Virgin Territories?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: The New Lands, the Virgin Territory. All of our agricultural experts,
                    and we had two very good Ag Attach�s in the embassy who spent all of their time
                    on the road looking at crops, etc., said this was a disaster in the cooking, and
                    we predicted that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We went through that same thing in 1917.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Precisely, it's the dust bowl. They were creating a dust bowl.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we telling them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, the information was certainly there. When they traveled it was
                    obvious. Soviet agricultural policy was a disaster from 1920 on. It was always
                    driven by politics, not productivity. Collectivization was not designed to make
                    more efficient farms, it was designed to remove the political independence that
                    farmers had, and the leverage they had on the regime. If they didn't deliver
                    their crops, the country went hungry. So they had to somehow get away from that,
                    and they did it by collectivizing. They broke the farmers. Everything they did
                    in the agriculture area was designed to increase productivity, but politics
                    always came first. And for Khrushchev the Virgin Lands was a new campaign. It
                    was a way to be a popular president. He wanted desperately to be genuinely
                    popular, and he was switching from rule by terror, to what he thought was going
                    to be rule by popular acclaim. He was dead serious about it, he failed, but it
                    wasn't for lack of trying. In his efforts to do this, he opened up the Soviet
                    Union quite a bit to western influence.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>To get back to Matlock, he eventually ended up in the political section, and
                    then, of course, he went back to Moscow as DCM, and then he went back again as
                    ambassador. I think all together he spent some 11 years in the Soviet Union. And
                    in the Gorbachev era, when Jack was ambassador, was DCM and then ambassador, he
                    was so good, he knew so much about them, that he eventually became almost an
                    informal member of their cabinet. He met with Gorbachev regularly. He would
                    attend meetings of the Central Committee to speak on things. He was able to have
                    a tremendous influence. I think history is going to record the incredible
                    accomplishments of Matlock, who is the latest in a series of outstanding career
                    ambassadors in Moscow. They're all steeped in Soviet affairs, three-timers
                    usually by the time they got to be ambassadors, they all went through an
                    education program, like I did at Harvard, they all arrived with the Russian
                    language. It was absolutely a superb performance by the United States, and we
                    dwarfed other embassies there in terms of our competence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find as an embassy, you were the people they came
                        to from other embassies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, all the time. It wasn't only our power, it was our knowledge. There
                    were a few areas where we were deficient, the Japanese, for example, had a
                    fisheries attach�, but we didn't have anybody in fisheries. But they came to us
                    for our agricultural attach�s. The French had a stronger cultural section than
                    we did in terms of the number of people, diversity of contacts, etc. But in
                    everything else, we were the best informed.</p>
                <p>Of course we had an extremely close working relationship with our allied
                    counterparts. I was the Berlin man in the embassy. Maybe I should talk about
                    that first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we talk about the whole Berlin thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Okay. Arriving there it became my responsibility to interpret what I
                    could see in the papers, by attending lectures, and traveling. I might interject
                    that we had “a travel program.” I was the travel officer in the political
                    section, among my other duties, and we deliberately laid out territories, or
                    areas, of the Soviet Union we wanted somebody to cover. The Defense Department
                    attach�s were on the road all the time for their own reasons, but we shared
                    maps. If we wanted to go to Frunze, and Alma Ata, which I did, and the Defense
                    attach�s had not been able to get certain information about the kinds of
                    factories which were present, etc., for their purposes, we would share
                    requirements. And they would come back and give us things like programs from
                    cultural events where we could see who was actually appearing. And we would pay
                    calls on the local editors in the newspapers in these outlying republics, and
                    we'd call on the republic foreign minister, who of course was a sham, but he was
                    thrilled when we showed up. That was the event of the year. So we would get
                    something out of that every time. I would say three-fourths of the Soviet Union
                    was off-limits, even though on the official map it was all open. You had to
                    apply for authority, a propusk, to go there. Then the Soviets would reply and
                    say, “Sorry, there are no hotel rooms this week,” which meant it was a closed
                    area. They didn't want to admit that that much of the Soviet Union was closed.
                    We had similar controls back here which I ran when I came back to the Soviet
                    desk in the State Department subsequently.</p>
                <p>But having arrived in Moscow, I immediately picked up on the Berlin subject—read
                    all the articles, and the magazine articles, and I met the person at the foreign
                    ministry who was dealing with it, and his boss, who was the deputy foreign
                    minister for Western Europe. He had three people under him, and I got to know
                    all of them—one of them quite well, even socially. And I was getting all the
                    reports from Berlin, and from Washington, and the intelligence community about
                    what was happening in Berlin. This was just before the wall went up. I was
                    convinced when I left Berlin, because the flood of refugees was becoming so
                    strong through West Berlin, that the Soviets would have to cut it off somehow.
                    And I predicted in a telegram from Berlin, which I had a lot of trouble getting
                    out from Moscow, because my immediate superior, Culver Gleysteen, felt that as a
                    “junior officer,” a new boy in Moscow, and that I shouldn't be dealing with such
                    high policy matters, I should focus on interpreting what was in the newspapers.
                    But I had my own views about that, and having been in Berlin, and right in the
                    middle of it at a fairly high level for two years, I was convinced that I was
                    right, and I wrote this message predicting that the Soviets would seal off
                    Berlin. Actually I thought they would put the fence around all of Berlin,
                    keeping our access to East Berlin open and thereby preserving the city's
                    quadripartite status. What they did, of course, was put the wall right through
                    the middle. Two weeks before they built the wall Hal Sonnenfeldt, who was in the
                    Department at that time, had come out to Moscow on a visit, I shared my message
                    with Hal, and he took it back. I never did get it out in its initial form from
                    the embassy because Culver sat on it. I didn't feel that I could go directly to
                    “Tommy” properly. Confronted with a bureaucratic block like that, I probably
                    should have gone to the Ambassador. But anyhow, the message got out, I got it
                    back through Hal. And lo and behold it happened. At that point our relationship
                    with the Soviets became extremely tense.</p>

                    between Nixon and Kennedy in the snack bar at the back of the embassy building.
                    We had our western colleagues and journalists in to watch this. We got the
                    tapes, we didn't see the TV live, but it was taped and flown out to us. And we
                    shared that, and we were all pretty excited about Kennedy.</p>

                <p>JENKINS: Well, we in Moscow initially, were all thrilled, and the Russians were
                    scared to death because Kennedy was a political sex symbol all over the world.
                    They couldn't cope with that. This was a popularity. Eisenhower had been
                    disliked by a lot of people, he was regarded as too old, too cautious. He was a
                    military man, so in Third World countries he was looked upon as sort of an
                    American imperialistic symbol. When Kennedy came in that was dissolved. And all
                    of a sudden the United States became the image and symbol of young, vibrant,
                    creative peace loving, tough, all the right words. And in Moscow the Russians
                    all felt this way. The people would come up to us in the streets, and say,
                    “Voroshe.” It was very satisfying. John Glenn went into space at that time, and
                    that was a plus, and again all the westerners, and the Russians, applauded us.
                    Nobody among the Russian people really wanted us to fail, because we were what
                    they wanted to become.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>However, we began to run into the arrogance of the Kennedy White House early on.
                    It was difficult. Tommy was extremely impressive and careful, and he nurtured
                    his ties, and played his hand very carefully. He was very secretive, he didn't
                    broadcast like Kennan did—his telegrams for everybody to see and to show off. He
                    really wrote telegrams for Kennedy and for Dean Rusk alone. I think our
                    impression of the Kennedy administration at first was very hopeful. We had felt
                    that Dulles and Eisenhower, and Chris Herter, the former governor of
                    Massachusetts, were weak on Berlin, didn't seem to grasp that it was our will
                    that was being contested. It was essential, just as in dealing with any
                    playground bully, that when you're tested, you have to stand up the first time,
                    or you're just going to spend all your time rolling over. It was that simple. It
                    was never fully taken at face value by the Eisenhower administration. When
                    Kennedy came in we were very hopeful that this would change. Here was a PT boat
                    hero, young, and vigorous. Dean Rusk was solid, and a wonderful man. But
                    Kennedy's White House, like Clinton's, was full of arrogant friends who all were
                    convinced they knew better than anybody. Dickie Goodwin, Schlesinger, the
                    historian, John Kenneth Galbraith, were absolutely convinced that they were
                    intellectually far superior to these drones in the Foreign Service and in the
                    embassy, etc.</p>
                <p>This attitude prevailed. So we became very nervous. We were competing for
                    Kennedy's mind, we thought. Things like Jack Matlock's airgrams about dissent
                    among the intelligentsia, were very important. Kennedy read those, and Jack
                    received a personal commendation from Kennedy for them. Tommy was very trusted.
                    Kennedy trusted him, so Tommy was able to dampen down a lot of the mischief that
                    Bobby Kennedy and all of his cohorts were promoting. And Bobby Kennedy was a big
                    part of the foreign policy process in the Kennedy administration, including in
                    my judgment, putting our troops into combat in Vietnam instead of remaining
                    “advisers.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes. But as we went on into this Berlin confrontation, it became more
                    and more serious. We faced the Khrushchev ultimatum. The Soviets began creating
                    incidents in the air corridors which had been sacrosanct up until then. I
                    remember once Sir Christopher Steele, the British ambassador, flew from Bonn to
                    Berlin in the corridor, and two MiGs came in and actually brushed the wings of
                    his plane. That was a huge confrontation, and it was one of the occasions when
                    our collaboration with our allies was so close.</p>
                <p>In the French embassy, Jacques Andreani, the present ambassador; in the German
                    embassy, Jorg Kasti, who is now retired; and in the British embassy, John
                    Tretwell, and I were a four-power working group on Berlin in Moscow. We were all
                    of one mind, and we shared everything in reporting. We ran over everything in
                    the telegrams with one another, and then cross-reported. That was very valuable
                    because we all had somewhat distinct access to different kinds of Soviets. We
                    would meet once a week at least, just to meet, but frequently we'd meet every
                    day depending on what was going on.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one little detail. Bugging was always...how would you
                        meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Each one of our embassies had a secure room, which is a plastic room
                    built within the room where you meet. It's up on plastic stilts, and has clear
                    plastic walls—they're plastic bricks, little squares and they're all bolted
                    together with plastic. We had a conference room, a table with chairs around it,
                    and we had a sound machine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A sound-making machine with sound around the outside.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, it wasn't very comfortable, and the temperature was never really
                    very good, but we assumed that anywhere else the Soviets could hear us. So we
                    would meet usually in our bubble, but sometimes in the British bubble and a
                    couple of times in the German and the French bubbles. Our bubbles were all very
                    similar. We would meet and analyze events, and decide what we were going to
                    report, and we'd tell each other what we were going to report. And then we'd go
                    back and report to our respective ambassadors, and keep them informed. The
                    ambassadors would also meet frequently as a group, sometimes with us, sometimes
                    without. In the Steele aircraft incident, to illustrate how closely we worked
                    together, it was decided that we had to do a protest immediately. When Steele's
                    plane was buzzed and brushed, we couldn't wait for our four capitals to
                    coordinate a message and send it back to us. It required an immediate protest in
                    the strongest language. So Tommy and Sir Frank Roberts, the British ambassador,
                    and the French and German ambassadors, all agreed. I took it upon myself to
                    write the first draft with my three colleagues sitting around the table with me.
                    Then they suggested changes and we ended up with a 2-page demarche, which we had
                    drafted together. So without waiting for approval, we flashed these back to our
                    capitals, and the ambassadors went in simultaneously with these protests. We
                    informed Washington instead of requesting permission. It was very tough
                    language, “we will take appropriate steps, including the use of force if
                    necessary, and if you want to bring our relations to a crisis point where world
                    peace is threatened, this is a good way to do it.” The message was delivered,
                    the Soviets took note of it, there was never another incident again. The only
                    reaction out of our capitals came from the British. Lord Hume was then Foreign
                    Minister. He wrote and commended the drafters of the demarche for an outstanding
                    job demonstrating initiative, etc., in the finest tradition of the British
                    service, etc. So Sir Frank and John Tretwell shared Lord Hume's message with
                    Tommy. That was a very satisfying and exciting thing to be part of.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>JENKINS: What were they up to? They were testing us, convinced that we didn't
                    have the willpower. They were pushing and slicing constantly, we called it
                    salami slicing, to see how far they could get. The goal was to eventually force
                    us out of Berlin. They seemed convinced that we would pick up our marbles and go
                    home, because it was too scary to continue the confrontation. And if that had
                    happened, in my judgment, the psychological impact in Europe would have been
                    decisive. And I think instead of the Cold War going our way, it would have at
                    least temporarily gone their way.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: It was still the case under Kennedy. There was great intellectual unrest
                    about this. Rusk was not that strong at the White House, Mac Bundy constantly
                    agonized over things, he was more interested in the intellectual process than he
                    was in the substance. The sense of history which Kissinger reflected so well
                    (and Acheson in his time), was missing. Rusk had a sense of history, but it was
                    all Asian oriented. I thought Dean Rusk was a magnificent human being, but
                    obviously he was basically mistaken about our role in Asia, and the Vietnam
                    war.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have that feeling at the embassy of unease?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, we did. We were not comfortable. We did not have the sense that the
                    policy was firm. We were constantly fighting for Kennedy's mind. We had great
                    confidence in Tommy, and we knew that Tommy was very effective in his dialogue
                    with Kennedy, and even with Bundy. But we also knew that around them were the
                    Dickie Goodwins of the world. Goodwin was the Stephanopoulos of the Kennedy
                    White House. He even had the woolly head hair-do which was not yet fashionable.
                    They were arrogant...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stephanopoulos for the record is William Clinton's chief

                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Policy adviser. All of these men had come out of the campaign. Pierre
                    Salinger was part of this but he wasn't a serious policy player. They were cocky
                    as hell, and convinced that we were a bunch of drones, and that we couldn't be
                    trusted, and if they could only get Khrushchev off in a room with Kennedy for an
                    hour, why, it would all work out. Which, of course, they eventually did in
                    Vienna and it didn't work out at all. What we said was true. Khrushchev came in,
                    stepped on his foot, kneeded him in the balls to look at his reaction. And the
                    reaction was weak, and therefore Khrushchev ratcheted up his initiative.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: We felt it was the golden opportunity for him to be charming, to have
                    Jackie charm Khrushchev, etc., and then have Kennedy come in and day, “Now look,
                    I want to say this perfectly straight. Get your bloody hands off Berlin or we'll
                    destroy you.” But he never did. He was constantly talking about, we've got to
                    find a way out, what can we do to reassure you, we don't want you to distrust
                    our motives, we're not aggressive. He played right into Khrushchev's impression,
                    and Tommy was upset. He didn't articulate that to us because he was just too
                    professional for that. But we knew he wasn't happy with the way it went, and we
                    indeed saw further deterioration in the confrontation as a result of that
                    meeting.</p>
                <p>But in the key period, in the winter of 1961 and '62, I believe the confrontation
                    in Berlin, the ultimatum having been raised, came down to “access.” So
                    Khrushchev switched his target, and he insisted that we accept East German
                    control of the access, which had been part of their focus from the beginning.
                    Remember Dulles originally had this idea that we would accept East Germans as
                    “agents of Moscow,” and legally our position would be unimpaired, he felt that
                    way. Well, this was not a legal issue, it was a psychological confrontation. And
                    Kennedy continued to futz around the issue. But the Russians got so aggressive
                    finally that we had to have a series of special negotiations on Berlin access.
                    Thompson and Gromyko, and Semyonov on the Russian side. I went with Tommy. I was
                    “the Berlin man” in our embassy. We had these long cables come out from the
                    Department with instructions. I would boil them down and interpret them for
                    Tommy. They were replete with details. And, of course, I had lived in Berlin so
                    I would get the instructions, and I'd work out a talking points paper for Tommy,
                    and then the two of us would go in and meet Gromyko. We had five meetings. They
                    were all very high profile, reported in the New York Times on the front page.
                    (My picture was on the front page of the New York Times with Tommy.)</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>The first meeting we held agreed to have these consultations on Berlin access
                    (which already made us nervous because we didn't want to consult on something
                    which was “a right”). But that's what Kennedy insisted on. As we arrived at the
                    first meeting Gromyko received us in his outer office and escorted us into his
                    little sitting room. Gromyko was extremely friendly. “Tommy, how's Jane? How are
                    your little girls? Is everything going well, I hope it's not too uncomfortable.
                    It is a difficult time for us, but it has always been a great pleasure for me to
                    work with you professionally because you are so professional.” He turned to me,
                    and this was all in Russian even though Gromyko spoke beautiful English, and we
                    chatted a little bit, and he complimented me on my Russian, and asked where I
                    lived, where was my apartment, etc. Semyonov was also friendly. They had a
                    translator, Victor, who had been Khrushchev's translator and subsequently became
                    Gorbachev's translator, he attended every meeting.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: No, Victor was a young man with wavy hair. He had gone to school in
                    Washington as a boy, and had very good English.</p>
                <p>We sat down and agreed that we would have another meeting the next week, and then
                    we tabled our position, and they tabled theirs, we both agreed we'd study the
                    positions and report back to our government. And we left. It was a very pleasant
                    meeting, about 45 minutes.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>The second meeting took place about a week later. We had long instructions from
                    Washington about what to present, etc. We walked in and Gromyko was absolutely a
                    changed personality. He was cold, hostile, unfriendly, abruptly told us to sit
                    down, and then launched into a 45 minute tirade about American irresponsibility
                    and aggression, and lack of legal basis for being in Berlin at all, and how
                    we're going to do this, and we're going to do that. And at one point he said,
                    “You know, you've got to recognize that if you allow Berlin to become the
                    flashpoint for a war, we will incinerate New York City in 24 hours.” That's
                    pretty heavy stuff. Tommy is sitting there on the couch, and I'm sitting on the
                    couch next to him—Tommy was a chain smoker (eventually he died of lung cancer),
                    and he's smoking quietly. Gromyko stopped. He gave this oration in a fairly high
                    pitched voice, it was not a casual conversation. He was pounding on the coffee
                    table. And Tommy just kept smoking, and there was silence. About 30 seconds went
                    by, Tommy never said a word. Gromyko said, “Well, Mr. Ambassador?” And Tommy
                    very quietly stubbed out his cigarette, and looked up at Gromyko, and said, “Oh,
                    are you through Mr. Minister?” It was a beautiful deflation. And of all the
                    things I witnessed, that was the coolest diplomatic performance I ever saw. I
                    was sitting there, my blood pressure was going up, of course, I didn't open my
                    mouth but I was taking notes. In these meetings I was the scribe, everything
                    that they said, or that we said in response, I wrote down as best I could. And
                    because it was first spoken in Russian, and I could understand the Russian, and
                    then repeated in English, I was able to do it because I'd catch three-fourths of
                    it, or half of it the first time, and fill it in the second round. And when we
                    spoke, the same thing happened. Tommy spoke slowly and deliberately, but if I
                    missed anything I got it in a Russian translation from Sukhodrev.</p>
                <p>Tommy sat there and waited and then said this, Gromyko's face fell. He was
                    clearly embarrassed. And then Tommy very quietly, in about two paragraphs, said,
                    “I deeply regret that you have been required to put on this performance, which I
                    regard as irresponsible, undiplomatic, and certainly below your high level of
                    diplomatic and professional behavior. You know, and I know you do, and I'm sure
                    Mr. Khrushchev appreciates this, that if we ever get into the beginning of a
                    nuclear exchange, that no doubt you can damage an American city or two, but you
                    also know that the entire Soviet Union will become a rubble heap within 24
                    hours. It's your choice of time frame, it will take a lot less than that.” And
                    he stood up, and we left. Gromyko's mouth was open. It was a dramatic
                    performance.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>After each meeting, we would return to the residence and Tommy and I would sit
                    down and review my notes. He was writing also on a pad, his interpretation of
                    what was happening, and then I would review his notes. And I would make
                    suggestions, and he would incorporate some of them, which was very heady stuff
                    for a young diplomat, and then he would correct some of the things that I had
                    done, or add an interpretative phrase. I would take the notes and go back to the
                    embassy with a driver, which was about a mile away where we had two secretaries
                    standing by. We'd go into the bubble, and they would type up my verbatim account
                    of the discussion, and Tommy's interpretation. This would take maybe an hour,
                    and then I would take those two papers, get back in the car and go back to
                    Spaso. This time we'd have a drink together, and Tommy would review them, and
                    say, fine. He'd make a few changes here and there, I'd get back in the car, back
                    to the embassy, and they'd go off Flash/Eyes Only for the President and the
                    Secretary of State. We sent six pairs of telegrams like that in this time. It
                    was very exciting.</p>
                <p>And one time, after the third meeting, and I'll go back to those meetings in a
                    minute, I came down and there was no car at Spaso. I called the embassy and I
                    couldn't get an answer, so there was no transportation. So, I took these two
                    drafts in my pocket and I walked the one mile from Spaso knowing...at first I
                    was really nervous thinking, what the hell should I do and I decided, damn it,
                    they'll follow me closely and I'm probably going to be safer making this walk
                    than any time in my life. It was very cold, this was in February, the snow was
                    scrunching under my shoes, and I was invigorated and began thinking, God, this
                    is great drama, and I'm in the middle of it and what a lucky fellow I am, and
                    I'm making a contribution. I got to the embassy and we typed it up, then I got
                    in my car and came back and we sent it out. But it was that one time, I never
                    saw anybody, a little shadow here and there, but I know as I walked those blocks
                    that within a half a block there were probably three or four people surrounding
                    me with a security cocoon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impression of the speech of Gromyko? When you
                        report this back, you're not catching the body language, and
                        expressions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Oh, we did. In Tommy's interpretive telegram he referred to that, and he
                    characterized Gromyko's performance as theatrical, dramatic, “staged,” and I
                    think, as I recall—I'd have to get my notes out—that it was another deliberate
                    probe of our will. A deliberate attempt to intimidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the important thing is that the professional diplomat
                        was able to diffuse this issue before reporting back and scaring the bejesus
                        out of the Kennedy team.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>JENKINS: The language that Gromyko delivered was reported verbatim practically.
                    Tommy's interpretation was also reported. Now, some people in Washington would
                    dismiss Tommy's interpretation and be paralyzed by the threat. The President, I
                    believe, because he had developed this confidence in Tommy, and many other
                    people, anybody who was witting and on top of it, realized that Tommy was the
                    best interpreter that the United States had, and that his words were extremely
                    weighty. I think that we helped stiffen the American spine by our interpretative
                    comments. The reaction in policy terms in Washington is reassuring in that
                    regard. But we knew that there were people back there saying, what are we doing
                    in Berlin? We've got to get out of Berlin, this is crazy. We're jeopardizing the
                    United States' security by this. Why are we there? This is a beachhead, we
                    shouldn't be there. Let's withdraw. There are a lot of people going that way,
                    and they were on both sides of the political aisle. You know, this bully is
                    threatening me, we've got to stand up and whip him. So we always felt this was
                    always in the balance, and the Russians clearly felt that way. They wouldn't
                    have gone through all this if they'd known for sure it was going to be
                    counterproductive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say, I think almost always in the profession, never
                        felt that World War III was going to start over Asia or some other place
                        like that. If it's ever going to happen, it was going to be over
                        Berlin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, it's interesting. Those of us who had been in Berlin, especially
                    me, I guess some people didn't agree with me perhaps, always felt that World War
                    III could start by miscalculation anywhere, but especially in Berlin. But that
                    in terms of a calculated military engagement, there was no risk at all. Our real
                    danger was to make sure that the Soviets didn't misinterpret our anguish,
                    intellectual approach, and massaging as weakness. But they did frequently, as we
                    saw. Khrushchev in Vienna misinterpreted Kennedy's performance as weakness. It
                    was just his intellectual approach to things: they can't be black and white. But
                    in Berlin, one of the rare occasions in my career, it was pure black and white.
                    And I reflected that and Tommy reflected that in his own very quiet way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there ever a concern...I mean I used to kind of feel
                        this in my gut that the real problem in Berlin was that maybe the Germans in
                        East Germany might take something to the wrong hands, and the West Germans
                        might get involved, and all of a sudden we would find ourselves...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: ...drawn into something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...essentially with an East German revolt which we
                        couldn't contain.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, that was always a possibility, but I think we always felt that the
                    West Germans were basically frightened. Adenauer was trying to cut deals with
                    East Germans long before we indicated any flexibility. Brandt was better. Brandt
                    was very strong in Berlin as a mayor. When he became chancellor, that seemed to
                    dissipate considerably. But I think we, both in Berlin where we regarded the
                    Germans almost as ploys in this whole thing, and in Moscow where the German
                    embassy was weak (Kastl was strong but his ambassador was an ego-maniac). The
                    German Ambassador thought he could seduce Khrushchev by being nice to him.
                    Khrushchev played him like a fiddle. I don't think we ever felt that the German
                    card would ever get out in front of our negotiations because we and the Soviets
                    were both so focused on them, we weren't going to let that happen. I mean, there
                    was an East German revolt, the refugee flow, and they put the fence up. We
                    didn't fight that. That's an example. We weren't going to start World War III
                    over East German attitudes, human rights in East Germany. If we were going to
                    start World War III it was going to be because the Russians were deliberately
                    trying to abolish our rights in Berlin. And as long as we drew that line, and
                    made it clear, they respected it, and there wasn't going to be a world war. All
                    the East Germans in East Germany wanted to either riot, or flee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Berlin wall happen while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: No. It didn't happen while I was in Berlin. It did happen while I was in
                    Moscow. The Cuban missile crisis happened shortly after I got back to the
                    Department. The wall went up while I was in Moscow.</p>
                <p>We would get our Quadripartite team together, share telegrams with them. The
                    interpretative ones we didn't always share, but the factual reports we did, and
                    we shared our instructions with them each time. The western press was all over
                    us. When we'd walk out of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Marvin Kalb, Semore
                    Topping, and UPI, were right there taking notes. This was the Berlin access
                    crisis, and the world all thought we were close to World War III.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came away from the performance of Gromyko, did we
                        just walk out and say, no comment.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>JENKINS: We went out the door and said, we'll report your views back to our
                    government, we regret this was necessary, and we left. Now, Gromyko called us in
                    for another meeting a week later, in the meantime we had another set of
                    instructions, of course, which were very strong. We presented our instructions.
                    The Russians rebutted them, and we went back to another round. We ended up with
                    the Russians agreeing that there had to be a formulation. They essentially
                    folded in front of our stern refusal to back down. They didn't give up their
                    theoretical position, but in terms of practice they agreed to stop harassing our
                    access. There was a Quadripartite working group set up to consider access
                    problems after that. But basically Khrushchev backed off, and that phase of the
                    Berlin crisis ended. It was very exciting and Tommy was a real hero. It was the
                    high point of my diplomatic career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in Berlin when the wall went up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: No, I was in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see this as almost a backing down? In other words
                        they weren't going to go for the whole hog.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, that was one interpretation of it. There was a big policy battle
                    going on within the west, mostly within the United States, with those who said
                    we should never have accepted the wall, that our access to East Berlin as
                    opposed to our access to Berlin generally, was a violation of the Quadripartite
                    agreement on Berlin. General Clay was sent in at that time to reassure the
                    Berlin population that accepting the wall didn't mean that we were abandoning
                    Berlin. We were constantly trying to make sure that we didn't lose this
                    confrontation by losing the Berliners. If they gave up and started fleeing to
                    the West, which they could do, the Russians would have picked up Berlin. So we
                    were trying to stiffen their confidence. We regarded the Wall going up as a step
                    short of trying to get all of Berlin. That was part of the back down. Yes, I had
                    never quite said it that way, but you're absolutely right.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>A number of interesting anecdotes in this time in Moscow. I attended public
                    lectures frequently. I went to one at a higher military education school in
                    Moscow, which was sort of like the War College. They would advertise once a
                    month a public lecture at the academy. And almost everybody there was in
                    uniform, and I went with my British counterpart to two of these. Everybody got
                    very excited when we walked in. An officer rushed up to the speaker and pointed
                    to us, etc. They went ahead as they're programmed to do. One of them was a
                    speech on Germany and Berlin. It was full of denunciations and the failures of
                    the imperialists in Germany, and how the German population was being exploited
                    by the capitalists, etc. These officers would then stand up in the audience and
                    say, “I was stationed in East Germany. I've been to West Berlin. I've seen
                    Germany. If Germany is in such terrible shape, and the West German government is
                    so bad, and the Americans are so bad, why is the standard of living so much
                    higher in West Germany than it is in East Germany? Which in turn is so much
                    higher than it is here.” The speakers would get very nervous. They knew we were
                    watching this, and the officers knew that we were there, and they were in a
                    sense recording this. Frequently these public lectures would break down into
                    total disorder, almost chaos, because the crowd would hoot at these people. And
                    that was very interesting, very insightful as the real attitudes of Soviets.</p>
                <p>We had a lot of very interesting colleagues in Moscow. Generally speaking foreign
                    countries sent their most qualified professionals there. I had this great
                    working group on Berlin, for example, but we also worked hard to entertain
                    ourselves. We had a dacha out in the country which belonged to the ambassador
                    obviously, but it was there for all the embassy to use. And one day Ambassador
                    Thompson had a party with a lot of westerners, and the new Brazilian ambassador
                    (who subsequently became Foreign Minister). He had just arrived and was invited
                    to the party. We had a soccer game. And, of course, the Brazilians are all big
                    soccer fans, and he got in the middle of it. Our Naval Attach� was dribbling the
                    ball down this very rough field, and the Brazilian ambassador came in to try to
                    take it away and the Naval Attach� gave it a boot and caught the Brazilian
                    ambassador's leg and broke it. Of course, he was in great pain. I drove him back
                    in to his embassy and got the American embassy doctor (We had a doctor in the
                    embassy.) He was put in a splint and eventually flown out to Helsinki, to be
                    taken care of.</p>
                <p>But on the way going back in the car, he was sitting there with tears coming down
                    his face it hurt so much, and I was trying to comfort him, and assure him that
                    everything was going to be fine, etc. He looked over with a sort of sick smile
                    on his face, and said, “It hurts like hell,” but he said, “it guarantees that
                    even though I've only been here a week, tomorrow I will be a hero in Brazil.”
                    “Ambassador breaks leg in soccer game with Americans.” A great guy.</p>
                <p>We had a lot of action with the Indians and the Egyptians, and others of the
                    third world. They were always in touch with a different set of Soviets, and
                    Western defectors. There was a colony of people, international Marxists in
                    Moscow, Burgess and McLean were part of this.</p>

                    great friend of mine. He was very sharp-tongued, British educated, teasing in
                    his pronouncements. Personally, we were very good friends, and he was crazy
                    about my wife. When I would take a trip, he'd always invite my wife, “C”, to
                    bridge and dinner. He would have people like Wilford Burchett and McLean for
                    this bridge party, with my wife, which was so interesting. Wilford Burchett was
                    an Australian journalist, who covered the Korean War from the North Korean side,
                    and was sympathetic to the North Korean side. He was at this point stationed in
                    Moscow, and not allowed to go back to Australia. Certainly McLean wasn't
                    welcomed anywhere else. So my wife would play bridge with these guys and come
                    back full of interesting information. One, she was charming, and two, she was
                    smart and fun to be with and they just talked a lot to her because they were
                    starved for conversation. That was all very interesting.</p>
                <p>My Australian colleagues were terrific fellows generally. Rob Lowrie was an
                    especially close friend who went on to become ambassador to Poland. Then a man
                    who subsequently became Australian Minister of Defense, who was an extremely
                    left-wing Laborite, came out to replace the first secretary. He had an American
                    wife, who was also a very left-wing Marxist, and we couldn't “educate” them. It
                    was very frustrating because we kept saying, this is what's going to happen, you
                    can't do this. He said, “I'm going to have a big party. All my new friends are
                    going to come.” So he invited 20 or 30 of us, and about 50 Soviets. One showed
                    up. We had warned him that nobody would come, and if they did it would just be
                    the KGB to come watch the rest of us. And that's exactly what happened. He began
                    to get educated in this process, but he was very cocky and he had a lot to
                    learn.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Another funny event occurred when the President of Ecuador visited; a new
                    president who was an alcoholic and very left-wing. The Soviets really went after
                    him because they were trying everyplace to build new outposts, and they made
                    great progress with this fellow. He bought MiGs, and invited Russian military
                    advisers in, etc. He came to Moscow on a state visit. He wasn't important enough
                    to spend all his time with Khrushchev, but he did meet with Khrushchev and there
                    was a picture in Pravda, etc. He was staying at the Sovietskaya Hotel, which was
                    one of the prominent, seedy establishments, but all hotels were seedy. This was
                    reserved for VIPs. Later I stayed there when I was negotiating with them on
                    trade with Harriman. But we would go there for dinner sometimes because the
                    restaurants for foreigners tended to be better than the other restaurants. This
                    was a party for Frank Meehan who was leaving to go to Berlin, and the Tretwells,
                    and the Meehans and the Jenkins, and key colleague Sam and Mary Wise were all
                    together. We were having drinks—the vodka was always good, we always got a lot
                    of caviar which was magnificent, and a lot of cashews. Usually you couldn't eat
                    the meat but you'd drank so much vodka and caviar you didn't care. We had a good
                    time, and we were in very gay spirits, when lo and behold at a big table next to
                    us here's the bloody Ecuadorian president, and his entourage of Ecuadorians.
                    There were about six with him, and four KGB goons who were in charge of taking
                    care of him. Their job obviously was to get him drunk, and then get him some
                    women, and tuck him away for the night, which was his lifestyle. So we're
                    sitting there at the next table. Mary Tretwell, John's wife, had been raised in
                    the Philippines (her father was an ex-pat), and she spoke fluent Spanish. She
                    was also a stunning girl, tall, black hair and it was sort of tight on her head,
                    and she had big eyes, and she was a great girl, a terrific personality (still
                    is). We're sitting there, and my wife was cute, Meehan's wife was cute, Mary
                    Wise was adorable, so we had four good looking women at our table, Mary
                    particularly. The Ecuadorian was very interested in all of this, and was sort of
                    ogling the girls all the time. And at one point, right out of the blue, I mean
                    nobody prompted her to do this, Mary turned to one of the Ecuadorians who was
                    there, and in fluent Spanish said, “I do hope you're having a good time, this is
                    a rather boring hotel.” They got up from the table, came over and joined our
                    table, all clustered around Mary, and the KGB goons were frantic. It didn't ever
                    lead to anything except a lot of drinking at the restaurant but it was a lot of
                    fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems with the KGB trying to set you
                        up, or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: We had a lot of first stage confrontations. When I traveled, for
                    example, which I did I think six times in two years, and I went to various
                    regions of the Soviet Union. Invariably, on the train or in the hotel, there
                    would be some bimbo come up and brush against me, and ask if I would buy her a
                    drink, and that sort of thing. It was never too aggressive, it was always just
                    probing a little bit. They had an eye, and they were very clever for marriages
                    that were in trouble. And Moscow was a tremendous pressure cooker, and if you
                    didn't have a solid marriage, it would really come unglued there. Or it would be
                    made solid. And some of our people had marital problems, and inevitably they
                    would get targeted for a more serious approach.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>We had a friend who was a single woman, UPI reporter, Eileen Mosley, who was the
                    number two person there, and a great girl, very bright, very attractive, nice,
                    good Russian. They set her up. They drugged her coffee, and then took her into a
                    KGB office some place, took all her clothes off, and photographed her in various
                    poses, being attacked by various men, and then sent the photographs to her and
                    suggested that she cooperate or else they'd be sent back to headquarters. We
                    were outraged. I was mad at the press because Henry Shapiro, who ran UPI, and
                    who had been there forever, and who cherished his unique contacts, exercised a
                    veto and the press refused to report this because the rule was that if anybody
                    was going to report on the activities of another newspaper, that newspaper had
                    to concur. It's a logical enough rule, I guess, but in this case we found it
                    very upsetting. We felt that story should have been blown sky high to teach the
                    Russians not to do that anymore. But it wasn't, and Eileen was shipped out, and
                    that was the end of it. I never trusted or liked Henry Shapiro. He was a very
                    wise man, knew a great deal, but he had so much invested in his unique post that
                    he didn't want to jeopardize it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is always a problem when somebody feels they have
                        something, they can be used.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right. They can be exploited, and the KGB was extremely clever
                    about that. A great book has been written about the Wennerstrom case, the
                    Swedish military attach� in Moscow, who was not there when I was there, who was
                    seduced on an ego basis, not on women, not money, not drink. They persuaded him
                    that he was going to be a key player in saving the world from World War III.
                    They gave him all kinds of things, and information, and he passed it, and he
                    became a two-way viaduct, and they got him hooked. He came to the United States
                    as Swedish military attach�, and of course we treated the Swedes as NATO members
                    practically, and he fed all kinds of stuff back to the Soviets. Eventually he
                    was caught in Sweden, he was convicted. An Englishman wrote a very good book,
                    Agent of Choice. It reflected how sophisticated the KGB was in exploiting
                    psychological frailties.</p>
                <p>The German ambassador, who was such an ego-manic, was named Kroll, he was a
                    politician, not a career man.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Oh, I know one other thing, a high point in my time in Moscow. While I was there,
                    John J. McCloy came to Moscow. He became essentially the arms control spokesman
                    for the administration. He was a very prominent man having been High
                    Commissioner in Germany, etc. He came out to Moscow with a very high powered
                    delegation to initiate what became the beginning of the arms control dialogue,
                    it was called the McCloy Zorin talks, Zorin being the ambassador on the Russian
                    side who was McCloy's counterpart. Gromyko served as Zorin's deputy in these
                    talks. McCloy had Butch Fisher, the legal adviser from the State Department, as
                    his deputy. But there were several other people on the team: Hal Sonnenfeldt was
                    one. We had Dick Gardner who is now ambassador in Spain, who was a UN expert. A
                    fellow named Tom Wolfe, who was an Air Force colonel, who was extremely
                    competent on weapons systems. And I was part of that delegation. We met with
                    Zorin and his delegation a half a dozen times and we reached an agreement. It
                    was the first step, and it had to do with testing, and exchange of information.
                    It was the first step in a series of negotiations which culminated with SALT II.
                    McCloy was impressive. While he was there in the middle of the negotiations
                    Khrushchev took him down to Crimea for a weekend with his daughter. They had a
                    family weekend together, and he came back with very interesting information from
                    Khrushchev which underlined the fact that Khrushchev did indeed want serious
                    arms control negotiations. The Russians were very tough negotiators, but McCloy
                    was extremely capable, a very bright man. And Butch was brilliant, and it was a
                    very interesting thing for me, and I stayed involved in arms control issues
                    throughout my career, never in the center, never full time, but I did a lot of
                    speaking on behalf of the SALT agreement around the country when we had trouble
                    getting it confirmed, etc. I would say the Berlin and arms control were the two
                    big issues for me.</p>
                <p>I covered Latin America as well. Frank Meehan did the NATO and African issues,
                    and Culver did the China, Vietnam and Laos issues. We all had things we had to
                    read because the Soviet position was always reflected to some degree in their
                    publications. We read provincial papers when we could get them whenever we
                    traveled because you've got a different story there. They were telling their
                    people out in the country-side something that they didn't want people in Moscow
                    to read. We monitored their TV programs, we went to the theater, we traveled and
                    talked to people on trains and in hotels whenever we could. And we developed, I
                    think, better than any other embassy, a real flow of material from within
                    Russia, and it was certainly never just the newspapers, but they were an
                    important part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Brezhnev a figure at all at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, he was the number two man. He was regarded as something of a puppet
                    for Khrushchev. Khrushchev was very rude, and even crude, about people around
                    him. He was always putting people down, and ridiculing them, and demonstrating
                    publicly that he was in charge. And he treated Brezhnev like a puppet. We were
                    never that impressed with him. Tommy thought Polansky was going to be the next
                    leader. He, of course, came a cropper in the agriculture arena. I don't know
                    what has ever happened to him. Gromyko survived through all of them. Mikoyan
                    survived through all of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last thing. You mentioned that you were involved with
                        Harriman at one point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, I was. This was back in the Department and we got into
                    negotiations with the Russians on the air agreement. However, departing from
                    Moscow was a genuine emotional wrench. I remember we flew back on KLM to
                    Amsterdam and then picked up PanAmerican to the United States, 1962 in
                    September. We got out to the airport, a lot of farewell parties. A very intense
                    effort was made to entertain ourselves collectively. I'm sure this was true when
                    you were in Belgrade too. Costume parties, and the girls all got very fancy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We skinny-dipped in the ambassador's pool when he was
                        away.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: There was a lot of that, and everybody had a lot of intensity. But there
                    was a special camaraderie. We left with very heavy hearts because we loved all
                    the people that were there. We knew that this was a high point in our
                    relationship, and although we have stayed friends with all of them to one degree
                    or another, it never is quite the same.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>But we got on that KLM plane and it was just marvelous. The dog was in the hold
                    in his box, and the three boys were taken up front by the airline hostesses and
                    entertained while we sat back in our seats, my wife and I, and had about four
                    martinis apiece while we flew to Amsterdam. Although we had known Amsterdam it
                    seemed such a beautiful city. It was before the days of graffiti, I might add.
                    It just hit us with such an onrush. We had gone outside to Copenhagen on a
                    vacation one summer for two weeks, but other than that we were in the Soviet
                    Union non-stop, and it was a big, big event in our lives. We all lost weight,
                    because we were strung out, but we were all on a high because we were doing such
                    exciting and important things. And the people around us were all such great
                    people. We didn't know it at the time, but the CIA station people, and we knew
                    who two or three of them were, but there were some we didn't know like Alex
                    Davidson the doctor who took care of the Brazilian ambassador. He was an Air
                    Force first lieutenant, or captain. It turned out five years later when we read
                    the Penkovsky papers, that Alex was one of the key contacts. And one of our
                    great British friends was the man in charge of Penkovsky, and it was his wife
                    who pushed the baby buggy in which Penkovsky would drop his documents. We knew
                    them well and had a lot of fun with them socially, and had no idea that was
                    going on. We were as close to the intelligence activities in the embassy as any
                    non-intelligence member, but that was so well done, and so professionally done,
                    I've great admiration for the way the agency guys did that, and the way the
                    British people did it.</p>
                <p>We played tennis in a British embassy tennis court, and we had squash at the
                    Indian embassy in the dead of winter. The place would be at zero where we were
                    playing, the ball was dead as a rock and we'd go down there and drink three
                    cognacs apiece, and then start playing, and by the end of the first set we were
                    down to T-shirts. That was fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe we should stop, what do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I could go another half hour if that's alright, maybe wrap it up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you went back to the Soviet desk, is that
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right, and that was an interesting three years.</p>

                <p>JENKINS: That's right, and I was on the internal side—we had multilateral and
                    bilateral. John Guthrie and Dave Henry ran the office of Soviet Affairs. I had
                    discreet responsibilities for two or three specific projects, and I found that
                    very interesting. I had wanted to be in multilateral because that's what I had
                    been doing, but the Department in its wisdom moved me to internal and I found
                    myself dealing with a whole different array of subjects, most importantly the
                    bilateral air agreement between Moscow and Washington, and the consular
                    convention. I initiated the consular convention idea. The air agreement had been
                    signed the year before and was not working. I picked that up not as the
                    initiator, but the State Department representative dealing with Najeeb Halaby
                    who was the head of the FAA. He was the point man on it. Harriman was very
                    interested in both of those, and we reported to Harriman and Llewellyn Thompson
                    on these things. Tommy, a year after I got back, was brought back and became
                    Counselor of the Department, and oversaw everything to do with the Soviet Union.
                    I continued to work with him a little bit on the Berlin issue then, but by that
                    time it had moved into a much broader, almost plateaued, and wasn't as dangerous
                    as it had been. He was personally involved in the Cuban missile crisis. He was
                    part of “Ex Com.” He was in fact the key voice. He's the one who designed the
                    final blockade package which was consistent with his principle, don't ever back
                    the Soviets into a corner, always give them a door to get out. And he did that
                    and gave them the way to get out. He proposed the package where the U.S. would
                    take down the Thor missiles in Turkey in exchange for the Soviets pulling their
                    missiles out of Cuba. We were going to take the obsolete Thors out anyhow, but
                    it gave Khrushchev a face-saving device. I was really in Washington no more than
                    a note-taker for him, whereas in Moscow I had been very heavily in the
                    substance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's a difference being in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right, and I was a mere FSO-3 at that point, or 4. But I was able
                    to carve out a couple of things for myself that became important. The air
                    agreement negotiations were very interesting. We had signed an agreement with
                    the Soviets to allow them to land in New York and Washington in exchange for
                    which we landed in Moscow. PanAm was the U.S. designated carrier. The Soviets
                    had aircraft problems because their planes were too noisy, and they didn't have
                    the right safety equipment. And they weren't giving us the kind of service and
                    facilities in Moscow that they had promised. So Halaby put together a team, and
                    I was the State Department rep reporting to Harriman who kept the overview on
                    this issue for the whole government. We finally decided we had to go to Moscow,
                    and there had to be a meeting between Halaby and Loginov who was the minister of
                    aviation. He was an air force general. Jeeb is a pilot, a terrific guy, I liked
                    him very much. We flew out and went through Frankfurt, then Denmark. In
                    Copenhagen we picked up the two Soviet navigators. We were on the FAA-1 plane
                    which was an executive jet and it couldn't fly all the way across the Atlantic,
                    we had to go through Greenland and Iceland, and Thule. And that was all very
                    interesting because we'd meet with the FAA representatives. They'd all come
                    together and Jeeb would give a pep rally speech; he was magnificent, I must say.
                    It was a great experience, and fun to go that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>But as we left Copenhagen and started in towards Moscow we hit the Baltic coast.
                    The Soviet navigators who were supposed to be bilingual in English, were unable
                    to explain to Jeeb what they wanted him to do. He was piloting himself, though
                    he had an FAA co-pilot. He very much wanted to fly into Sheremetyevo and land
                    the plane, and then go into Loginov and say, “I landed here.” He's a real
                    hot-pilot personality. But about ten minutes into Soviet air space, Jeeb got on
                    the loud speaker (I'm in the eighth seat back in this ten-seat plane), and he
                    said, “Jenkins, get up here right away.” So I went up into the cockpit where the
                    two navigators were sitting behind the two pilots. I squatted down on my knees
                    in between them—the four of them, in the center of the four of them. And Halaby
                    said, “I can't understand what this guy is trying to tell me. He keeps pointing
                    at things, but I don't get it.” And, of course, I spoke Russian, I was recently
                    out of our Moscow embassy, but I didn't speak “aviation Russian”—its a different
                    vocabulary. So it was a pretty nervous period, but they would tell me and I
                    would tell Jeeb what I thought they were trying to say, and he would say, “They
                    must mean so-and-so.” So then I'd go back to them, and try to explain to them
                    what Jeeb thought they meant, and get them to confirm it. And that's the way we
                    flew into Sheremetyevo. It was pretty “hairy.” We arrived and, of course, we
                    went into the negotiations with Loginov.</p>
                <p>One of the things that the Soviets wanted was...they had the largest plane in the
                    world. It had eight engines, and I forget the designation. It was a TU-142 or
                    something, and it was a big plane, it wasn't wide-bodied, but it was huge. They
                    wanted to be the biggest, and the best always, and this was their aviation bid.
                    They wanted to fly this damn plane to the United States because they'd get a lot
                    of publicity. Jeeb insisted that there wasn't any way in the world they were
                    going to sign off on licensing this plane to land in the United States unless he
                    flew it first. Well, they weren't going to let him fly it because it was a brand
                    new plane, and they weren't sure all the bugs were out, and he said, “Well, if I
                    don't get to fly it, it doesn't go.”</p>
                <p>So we went back and forth with Loginov in the negotiations. Of course, we made
                    our presentation in English, it would be translated, and then the Russians would
                    come back in Russian. As I heard the Russians, it was clear that Loginov was
                    being urged by his advisor, “For Christ's sake, let him fly the plane. We want
                    to get it in there.” And Loginov was beginning to back off, and all of a sudden
                    it looked like Jeeb was going to give up. So I interceded with him, and said,
                    “Look, I can tell you they are about to give you what you want, don't back off,
                    you'll get it.” And, of course, he didn't back off, and we did get it and he
                    flew it, and it was a terrible experience! The plane was very hard to fly, Jeeb
                    said, “I damned near crashed the thing because you could barely turn it.” It
                    took two people, it was a huge big flying boxcar. So we didn't license it even
                    though Halaby flew it. Eventually it was allowed to fly in, after they installed
                    a lot of hydraulic controls which they hadn't had before then. We eventually let
                    it fly to Dulles a couple times, but it never became the principal carrier.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>The other issue was the consular convention. I sat in internal affairs with all
                    of the consular problems we had with the Soviets. While I was there, e.g., a
                    history professor from Yale named Freddy Barghoorn, who was well known to Tommy
                    and to all of us in the Soviet field at that time (which was very small in the
                    academic world, knew one another, and we were all close). Freddy had been in the
                    government once a long time ago, in research. But he was a professor at Yale, he
                    knew Kennedy from school connections. So when the KGB grabbed him it quickly
                    became a crisis. He was visiting in Moscow. He was on his way to visit somebody
                    at a hotel. Two Russians came up and bought him a drink, and then handed him
                    some things, including a role of industrial plans, as it turned out. Then they
                    arrested him with the plans in his arms. It was a total put-up job. They accused
                    him of espionage. These were plans for an air base. So Freddy was spirited off,
                    and he didn't show up for dinner with our DCM at the embassy (who was Ed Friers
                    at that time). Nobody could figure out what had happened to him. Finally three
                    days later we found out that he was in jail. And we raised holy hell. With that
                    in mind when I got back to the Department, I decided we should go after a
                    consular convention, which spells out that if you arrest any American, within 24
                    hours there has to be notification, and within three days there has to be
                    visitation. There had never been a treaty between the United States and the
                    Soviet Union at that point, and this consular treaty would then have unusual
                    significance. The Russians predictably were excited about having a treaty with
                    the United States. The political significance of doing this, the recognition of
                    their illicit regime, was very important to them. Thus, I thought we had enough
                    leverage to get them to make these exceptions.</p>
                <p>So we opened negotiations. A fellow named John Harris from the Legal Office who
                    was the legal expert on consular conventions, and I, sent a stream of
                    negotiating telegrams to Mac Toon, who was our Moscow DCM at that point. Malcolm
                    Toon whom you may have known in Yugoslavia. Anyway, Mac was running it out in
                    Moscow. They would go in and negotiate with the Soviet Foreign Ministry on the
                    basis of our instructions, and report back. This went on for eight months or so.
                    Each paragraph, each chapter was a big hassle. The key at the end was access and
                    notification. They had taken the position that if somebody breaks the law in the
                    Soviet Union, “we will let you know when we think it is appropriate,” and that
                    could be six months. And they wouldn't give in on this, they said Soviet law
                    doesn't permit us to give you what you want. Well, I knew from the German
                    embassy (Bernd von Staden was the first secretary here then, he subsequently
                    became ambassador here. He was a good friend of mine). I got all the German
                    consular conventions with Moscow. They had a string of them dating back. And
                    there had been cases under previous German consular conventions where they had
                    access and notification specified. It was usually a phrase like “rapidly” or “as
                    fast as possible.” But I wanted one day and three days specified.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Finally Toon became frustrated because the agreement was all ready to be signed
                    except for this point. And he sent a cable back (Mac prided himself on being a
                    tough guy) saying, “We're never going to get it that way, this is a good
                    agreement. Let's agree on this.” I wrote a first person cable for Secretary Rusk
                    to the embassy saying, “I don't care if we have to wait until hell freezes over,
                    there will be no consular convention unless it specifies one day notification,
                    three days access, and you are instructed to inform the Soviets to this effect.”
                    Toon came back with a telegram saying, “You're kissing this thing goodbye, we
                    had an agreement. It was the first agreement, it would have been important.” He
                    had developed a little localitis on this subject. We held our ground, they
                    folded, we got the consular convention, and I'm very proud of that.</p>
                <p>So then comes the question—it's a treaty, it has to be ratified by the Senate. We
                    had to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Fulbright and
                    Sparkman were there, and Harriman was the witness. Harriman had approved the
                    negotiation each step of the way. He was very tough, and very good. However, it
                    was the first treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States, and all
                    sorts of anti-communist currents were in play. Why are we doing this, we're
                    giving the Russians something. But Harriman spelled it out: “We are achieving
                    something we've never had before, it gives us the ability to really protect
                    American citizens.” “How do you know they will adhere to it?” “If they don't
                    adhere to it they're breaking a treaty, and they'll pay a big price for that in
                    terms of public image, etc., and I'm confident if they sign it, they'll do it.”
                    He said very little. They'd ask him questions, and he'd sit there and answer,
                    “Yup” or “Nope.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who is this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Harriman. We left after an hour, I don't think he spent more than ten
                    minutes talking. All the rest of it were the Senators trying to draw him out on
                    things. He was very uncommunicative. I didn't say anything obviously, except
                    when he turned to me and asked me to say something. Going back in the car, I
                    said, “Governor, that was the damnest performance I've ever seen, you didn't
                    tell those guys anything.” And he said, “That was deliberate. You wait and see,
                    this thing will pass. This is one of those situations where if you give them
                    anything they'll chew on it and turn it against you.” He said, “I wasn't about
                    to tell those bastards anything.” Sure enough, it did pass. Dirksen was there. I
                    liked Dirksen. I had met him in Bangkok, and he was very nice to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there in Washington during the Cuban missile

                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right, and I had no play in that, which was very frustrating
                    because I regarded that as an extension of the Berlin crisis. It was an unhappy
                    period in my career in many ways. My boys were doing well in school, and we
                    lived in a nice little house in Wood Acres, and I dealt extensively with the
                    Soviet embassy here, and I made friends with two or three Soviets and had them
                    out to the house a lot. I wheeled and dealed as much as I could, and I got very
                    much involved with the German embassy, and the British embassy. But I wasn't
                    doing the things which I thought were really important like the Cuban missile
                    crisis. Moscow had spoiled me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I don't remember when that date occurred. I certainly remember the
                    event, but I don't know where I was when it happened. But I was not involved in
                    it.</p>

                <p>JENKINS: About the change?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About what the Soviets were after. We had gone through the
                        Berlin thing, and then there had been the Cuban missile crisis, and then you
                        had almost three years after that when you were watching. What did we think
                        the Soviets were up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: We felt that Khrushchev was a true trail blazer in terms of internal
                    liberalization. It wasn't dramatic by western standards, but within the Soviet
                    framework, the things that he permitted to happen were very dramatic. And we all
                    believed that those were the first steps, that they were irreversible, that this
                    process of the ice thawing, and the river beginning to flow, was never going to
                    turn around.</p>
                <p>Secondly, we felt that he was, for reasons we didn't understand, a very dangerous
                    man. He was a hip-shooter, a gambler, and whereas Stalin, and subsequently
                    Brezhnev, would never take a risk when there was a chance that we might in fact
                    strike in reaction. Khrushchev did it regularly. He was constantly testing our
                    will, and gambling that we wouldn't react. So we felt that in the mold of Soviet
                    leadership, Khrushchev was a dangerous man, and he was well gone. He was
                    actually overthrown because of his humiliation over Berlin, Cuba, and maybe more
                    importantly, his fiasco in the New Lands agricultural program. Those were the
                    three most important things, as revealed in the documents about his overthrow.
                    They emerged in the speeches and Sovietologists were able to analyze that. I
                    don't think there's any debate about that.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>We didn't think that Brezhnev was going to be as weak as he turned out to be. We
                    thought he might be a plus, less adventurous than Khrushchev, but equally
                    committed to internal reform. It turned out that he was less committed to
                    internal reform. The KGB ran wild under him. But he was much more cautious
                    internationally. He did things like the invasion of Czechoslovakia (which
                    occurred in '68 when I got back from Venezuela). And some people might say that
                    that was dangerous, but it wasn't dangerous. It was clear in his mind that he
                    could do what he wanted within the realm of his empire. It was embarrassing, and
                    it backfired, but it was not so dangerous. So that's what we felt about
                    that.</p>
                <p>Let me quickly switch off to Venezuela, because we're going to run out of time. I
                    went down to Venezuela...one of the things I did on the desk, was design a plan
                    to assign Russian specialists, Moscow hands, to other places in the world where
                    Soviet activities were important. We ended up with some six designated posts:
                    New Delhi was one, and in many ways the most important, Roger Kirk went there. I
                    had my choice really, because I set the program up, and I was tempted to go to
                    New Delhi but the schools were bad there at that time, and my three boys were
                    getting to the point where schooling was important. So I chose Venezuela because
                    the schools were the best there, and I had spoken Spanish in college. We sent
                    Joe Norbury to Chile, Jack Scanlan went to Uruguay, Morrie went to Mexico.
                    There, e.g., were 400 Soviets in the embassy in Montevideo. They ran Soviet
                    efforts in Latin America, so we had somebody down there. Of course, the agency
                    had people in all these places but their objectives were different than ours.
                    And it upset the Soviets that we did this, it was effective, it was a good
                    program, it was a good idea.</p>
                <p>In Venezuela, I originally became the number two man in the embassy political
                    section, and then I became political counselor, and that was fascinating. It was
                    a time of President Leone, and the communist terrorists were trying to overthrow
                    the government. The day we arrived there were 21 traffic policemen who were
                    machine gunned and wounded around the city. A lot of terrorism. We had very
                    extensive security considerations. My predecessor, Ted Long's house had been
                    attacked. He'd been tied up in his house, and they spray-painted his house
                    inside with communist slogans. So there was that pressure. But it was a happy
                    time in many ways. My boys all played tennis at the Venezuela Club and became
                    national champions in Venezuela. The ambassador, Maury Bernbaum, was a wonderful
                    man; Frank Herren, the deputy, was an old Latin American type. Instead of
                    resenting my out of area expertise, they used me, and pushed me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find in dealing with the ARA, that they really
                        needed this...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes,...outside area, that's right. No question about it, that was a
                    Kissinger doctrine, and it was the right doctrine, and Bernbaum and Herren, to
                    their credit, accepted it with enthusiasm. I arrived down there as a total
                    outsider with high school Spanish, I did pick it up quickly. But, you know, I
                    didn't have anything like the area experience that they did. Maury Bernbaum was
                    another great ambassador, a marvelous man and steeped in Latin America. And
                    Frank Herren was also a marvelous man, they were great guys to work with, and
                    they gave me my head and I got a lot done, had a lot of fun. We turned around
                    the military assistance program and got it much more focused on
                    counter-terrorism, and less traditional navy activities. I knew all the
                    politicians. We were accepted by the opposition as well as the government, and
                    we were able to develop a much more anti-Moscow attitude within the labor
                    government in power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, I befriended all these men with the help of Maury and Frank. They
                    were all very interested in my Moscow experience. I set up a channel where Bill
                    Luers, who took my place in Moscow, was sending me materials from the Soviet
                    press about Venezuela which denounced the Venezuelans as a bunch of lackeys. I
                    was putting this in the Venezuelan press. The government loved that. They also
                    had the Cuban terrorists land on the beach that we were involved in. Sol
                    Linowitz came over as the OAS ambassador in charge of an OAS delegation to
                    interrogate these eight Cubans who'd landed with weapons. I was Sol's adviser in
                    that operation. Venezuelan politicians had a lot of confidence in the three of
                    us. We entertained them a lot. I ate lunch virtually every day with a government
                    official or parliamentarian.</p>
                <p>They ended up having a lot of confidence in the American embassy, and that's to
                    Maury's great tribute. I got a huge bonus from the fact that my three little
                    boys were Venezuelan national champions, and written up in the sports pages of
                    the papers. The Venezuelans really were impressed with that. We were members of
                    Venezuelan clubs, and my wife and I both spoke pretty good Spanish, the boys
                    were all bilingual. The whole embassy was strong. It was a good embassy, high
                    quality people, and a great ambassador. So we had a lot of influence. We had a
                    lot more influence than, I think, our embassies in most countries. The oil issue
                    was a big issue, and Maury was a great expert on that question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view the Venezuelan government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>JENKINS: We liked the Leone government. We were very close to them. We also liked
                    the Caldera party which was in opposition. They were all people who had been
                    heroes in getting rid of Perez Jimenez, the military dictator, and they had had
                    three democratic elections in a row. The first time in the history of Venezuela
                    they'd ever had democratic elections, and they had actually changed party once,
                    then changed it back again. So we were very enthusiastic about the Venezuelans,
                    and we thought that inevitably Venezuela would succeed. They were building a
                    middle class which was substantial. I still have Venezuelan friends. A lot of
                    them educated in the United States, a large cadre of U.S. educated Venezuelans.
                    And they were all torn, it was a love-hate relationship. They loved the United
                    States, but they criticized us a lot.</p>
                <p>We went through an earthquake there, which was an unforgettable experience. We
                    were on the eighth floor of an apartment building. Six hundred people died in
                    this earthquake in Caracas. My wife had just had a cancer operation and it was
                    our first party, and we were on the balcony having martinis, as was our wont
                    when we were young, and it was spilling out of the glass, and I was holding it
                    upright. The building had tipped, and the building next door went down and a
                    couple hundred people died in it. So it was very scary, and upsetting, and an
                    unforgettable experience.</p>
                <p>Caracas was also a sad place for me because my wife was so sick there, and we
                    returned home in 1968. I never went abroad again, and she subsequently died of
                    cancer two years later.</p>
                <p>I was to go into the War College, my picture was in the book and everything else,
                    and I was nervous because I would have had to travel a lot in the War College
                    and my wife, “C”, was not well, the cancer had returned. When Pic Littell and
                    Dick Davies invited me to USIA to be a deputy assistant director, I took it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we work at that, because looking at the time and
                        I think we might talk about working with USIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Okay, I can do that. I had five years there. After the first year I was
                    promoted to be the assistant director, the area director for the Soviet Union
                    and Eastern Europe. It was absolutely fascinating. I had about 100 people
                    working for me overseas in that area, all the PAOs, and the cultural and press
                    officers. We ran an exhibits program which every other year put an exhibit into
                    the Soviet Union for eight months. It was seen by more than a million Soviets.
                    And we designed the themes, and selected and trained the guides, some of whom
                    have gone on to be Foreign Service officers and Russian specialists. When the
                    Czech invasion occurred right after I got to USIA, I was part of the
                    inter-agency group (Mac Toon was chairing it). At that point he was Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary of State. We tried to figure out what we could do to deflect
                    the Brezhnev doctrine from spreading. We knew we couldn't do anything about
                    Prague, and that was very sad. We were not pleased with the uncertain reaction
                    of the U.S. at that time but it probably on balance was the best that could be
                    done. But we did look around for ways to send the message to the world, and to
                    the Soviets, and Brezhnev, that they better not try this anywhere else. The
                    danger was in Yugoslavia, which Khrushchev had relinquished, but which was
                    always a bone in the Soviet throat. They wanted it back obviously. And Austria,
                    one-fourth of which had been part of the Soviet empire. We weren't at all sure
                    that it wasn't going to spread.</p>
                <p>So there was a sense of panic in the face of the Brezhnev doctrine in Washington.
                    I designed a USIA plan to plant the U.S. flag as much as we could throughout the
                    area by establishing several cultural centers. We opened a big cultural center
                    in Bucharest which is still today being visited by roughly a thousand Romanians
                    a day. We opened up in Yugoslavia in each province a cultural center, Skopje,
                    Sarajevo, Ljubljana, and Zagreb. We trained young USIA officers in the
                    respective languages. I sent a young fellow named George Fornier to Skopje
                    speaking Macedonia. This occurred about six months after the earthquake, and
                    boy, did they love him. We planted the flag, and every place people would flock
                    to us. We opened a consulate in Lvov in Poland, it was a big success under FSO
                    Vic Gray, financed by my USIA budget.</p>
                <p>I had very interesting people as USIA directors, Leonard Marks who was there for
                    just a year, and then Frank Shakespeare came in. Frank was a real hard-line
                    dinosaur on dealing with the Soviets. But eventually Frank came around to the
                    fact that we could undermine Soviet power through information and sheer
                    consumerism. That that's what USIA could do the best.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was in Yugoslavia, we used to distribute to Soviets
                        things that would come in, the Sears Roebuck catalog.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Oh, yes, that's a microcosm of what we were trying to do generally. I
                    got the Voice to expand its hours in minority languages, and beefed that up
                    considerably, and Frank was giving me the best people he had because he thought
                    blocking the Soviet power was the most important thing in the world. So I had a
                    hell of a good collection of PAOs.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we pick up the next time? We can probably finish
                        this off, I think, dealing with both USIA and Congressional relations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, and the year at Commerce. * * * * * Q: Today is 24th of March
                    1995.</p>
                <p>You mentioned about doing minority languages. At that time what do we mean by
                    minority languages?</p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, in the then Soviet Union, any language other than Russian was
                    called, for lack of a better handle, a minority language. The Voice at that time
                    had, it seems to me, four hours a week in Ukrainian. We had Ukrainian programs,
                    we had programs in the Baltic languages, and programs in the Central Asian area
                    were very weak. That's why I pushed hard to get into Kazakh, and Uzbek, etc. We
                    had some very good people, some from Radio Liberty who had been specializing in
                    these minority languages all along. It's a very difficult distinction to explain
                    but there is a need, there was and still is in some cases, a need for both an
                    official U.S. government voice, explaining our policies on world issues, and
                    domestic developments in the United States. And, a surrogate program which is
                    designed to provide news and developments about the Ukraine, which the
                    Ukrainians were not getting because Radio Moscow was strictly putting out
                    Moscow's propaganda line. This was part of our effort to undermine Moscow's
                    hegemony over all of these areas.</p>
                <p>Radio Liberty for years, from its inception, was designed to do exactly that kind
                    of thing, but focus much more on gossip, and scandal, and there was much less of
                    a control over the veracity of what they were reporting. Their staffs were
                    composed largely of refugees from those areas. American supervision of those
                    programs was loose, and in some cases the local services had their own agenda.
                    It happened to usually be consistent with the American agenda, but not always.
                    So as time went on it became necessary to tighten supervision, and to provide an
                    official U.S. voice in those areas, such as in Uzbek, which we did. Then we had
                    total control over what was being said, the position of the American government
                    was being articulated. Having a surrogate station say things which were not
                    necessarily totally consistent with the American position was then within the
                    context, at least they knew what the U.S. government position is. Now the
                    Soviets, of course, tried to jam all these broadcasts, and they spent a lot of
                    money putting up transmitters, which is what you use to jam. We call them palm
                    trees, they're great big tall towers with things that hang down like fronds. You
                    could see them all over Moscow, for example. And when you'd go into major cities
                    in the minority republic capitals, you'd see them there too. But out in the
                    countryside, of course, they couldn't do that effectively. So the Voice was
                    getting through. Radio Liberty was getting through. They've spent more effort
                    jamming Radio Liberty because Radio Liberty was more embarrassing to them, where
                    we were building for the long term. So that's what I mean when I say minority
                    broadcasts, minority language broadcasts.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>One of the things I was empowered to do as the head of the policy section of USIA
                    for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, was to try and refine, direct, hone,
                    shift resources around to make sure we were hitting the key targets with the
                    most effective messages. We also had—I don't know whether I mentioned this
                    earlier in the tape—a very effective program of national exhibits. Under the
                    exchange agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, the Soviets
                    for their purposes wanting to get scientists and mathematicians over to the
                    United States for training, agreed to permit a number of other things, exchange
                    of national magazines once a month, for example. We produced something called
                    America, and they produced something called USSR Today. Their magazine was not
                    well done, not well printed, and we had great difficulty getting them
                    distributed which was our responsibility. Ours was slick, Life magazine- style
                    type thing, it went like hot cakes all over the Soviet Union. We only were able
                    to do 50,000 on each side because the Soviets realized that this was a potent
                    weapon. But they did agree to an exchange of so-called National Exhibitions
                    every two years. The exhibition would be a theme which I would choose, or my
                    office would choose, such as recreational equipment. That sounds harmless, but
                    in point of fact it was campers, and recreational vehicles, Kayaks, and tents,
                    and all the things which to Russians were absolutely the most desirable items in
                    the world. And we were able to portray a picture of the United States through
                    this exhibition of the fulsomeness of our society, and the choices offered in
                    terms of recreation. Each exhibition was staffed by native speaking guides. The
                    exhibition office, when I directed it, selected 25 guides who were
                    Russian-fluent, came from all walks of life in the United States. They would go
                    out with the exhibition, and stand in front of these exhibits. So we had, for
                    example, a new Cadillac, and in front of that Cadillac—and this was at the
                    height of the early days of the Vietnam War—I had a black female American who
                    was fluent in Russian, standing there defending our policies in Vietnam, in
                    Russian to Russian audiences. It just blew their minds. So we had a hell of an
                    impact, and those exhibits would go around to five cities. The negotiation of
                    which cities was always difficult. They always wanted you to stay in Moscow
                    where the KGB could be all over you. And I kept insisting on going to places
                    which were much more politically sensitive. So we ended up breaking into new
                    areas with an American presence. Our 25 guides would be there for twelve weeks,
                    and they really got into the community at that time, being fluent, and, of
                    course, the Russians kept taking them home. The local KGB was apoplectic because
                    they were trying to control all these people. There were incidents, of course,
                    but on the whole this was an extremely valuable thing, and roughly a million and
                    a half Soviets would see each one of these exhibits. I took Bill Buckley out,
                    who was on the Board of Advisers...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill Buckley is a right-wing columnist. Right-wing is the
                        wrong term, conservative, but also very much an intellectual.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Very much, and he had been a strong anti-communist spokesman. And Frank
                    Shakespeare, who was brilliant in many ways, loaded up the Advisory Board with
                    people who were really important opinion-makers in the United States. Bill
                    Buckley was one of those. I got to take Bill on his first trip to the Soviet
                    Union, which he found absolutely fascinating, and came back a tremendous
                    proponent of USIA and the State Department. It helped us a great deal down the
                    road, on the Panama Canal treaties, and other things. As a result I had a
                    personal friendship with him, I'm still in touch with him occasionally. He was
                    so impressed with these guides and these exhibits, he wrote about it, he talked
                    about it, and it was a very helpful thing. So those exhibits were a big part of
                    our program, along with the Voice. We, of course, had cultural events going in,
                    and we had a public affairs staff in the embassy, very good people, all Russian
                    speakers. The University of Michigan marching band, for example, toured the
                    Soviet Union and you can imagine the impact that had. Benny Goodman also. There
                    were great programs. USIA spent a good deal of money on this, but I think it was
                    money extremely well spent, a hell of a lot less expensive than an MX
                    missile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting reports back on how these things...were
                        you sitting down saying, okay, this was fine, it's very popular but here is
                        a government that is controlled from the top. What was the ultimate
                        purpose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, this was one of the things where I had, I thought, my most serious
                    challenge. It was to try and bring home to Frank Shakespeare and Henry Loomis,
                    the leadership of the agency, the fact that USIA's objective, and in the long
                    run the most effective instrument of American policy to both contain and then
                    subvert Soviet control, was to reach out to people and demonstrate that there
                    were societies which were working, where choices were available, and that the
                    West was not weak, it was strong, and they weren't ten feet tall, we were ten
                    feet tall. We were trying to stimulate consumerism. Frank often got carried
                    away. He always wanted to have dissenters like Sakharov on the Voice, which I
                    felt was the wrong way to go about it. I thought Sakharov's message was getting
                    out, we didn't have to wrap the American flag around him. What we should be
                    talking about is how in a given year so many hundreds of thousands of new jobs
                    were created, and each one of these people had automobiles, and houses, and that
                    these things were available in the U.S. to workers. I subsequently found myself
                    promoting trade and non-strategic items for the same reason. I wanted Coca Cola
                    and Pepsi Cola in there. They were subverting Moscow's hegemony, and control.
                    The Voice was getting through, and this constant drumbeat of the richness of
                    western life, not only in the material sense, but in the spiritual sense, did in
                    fact lead to undermining the regime, did stimulate a demand for a better life,
                    did stimulate recognition of the fact that better lives exist other places which
                    are not burdened by their crazy political system. So we were subverting Moscow's
                    control, and that was the objective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even there...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>JENKINS: But anybody who knew the area, spoke the language, had lived there,
                    moved around, knew that it was working. And Shakespeare, to his credit, got that
                    message. He went there enough, he saw enough, and he began to understand that
                    this was a very effective instrument we had there. And he became very
                    enthusiastic about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any cooperation with the BBC? Or did they have a
                        different message?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: No, basically we were all involved in the same game, the BBC,
                    DeutcheWelle, Kol Israel. And I visited all those places. I went to Israel and
                    spent three days there with the Israelis, one, providing them with engineering
                    assistance on how to overcome jamming, but also talking about the message. I had
                    a lot of pressure to initiate at the Voice a Hebrew language broadcast into the
                    Soviet Union to reach the Jewish community, and I resisted this. One, Soviet
                    Jews didn't speak Hebrew, they spoke Yiddish if they spoke anything other than
                    Russian.</p>
                <p>Two, the worst thing that we could do would be to provide credibility to historic
                    Russian charges that the Jewish community in Russia was not loyal, they weren't
                    loyal Russians, they were in fact agents of foreign countries.</p>
                <p>And thirdly, the Jews in the Soviet Union wanted their kids to be speaking in
                    Russian, to get ahead. They were trying to hold on to Yiddish, but it was a
                    losing fight. They didn't have any access to Hebrew except through Kol Israel.
                    So Congressman Ben Rosenthal, and the so-called Jewish caucus in the House, and
                    there are about 15 Congressmen, invited me up to the Hill. I'm in Ben's office
                    surrounded by these guys, and they're pounding on the table saying, “You have
                    got to initiate Hebrew broadcasts, or we're going to penalize your budget.” And
                    I was arguing why this wasn't a good thing. They said, “Well, we'll give you six
                    weeks, and we want to meet again in six weeks, and we want to know what you've
                    done.” So I went to Israel, it was a stroke of genius. It just came to me out of
                    the blue. I took a VOA engineer to help them overcome jamming. I met with the
                    head of Kol Israel, and with the deputy Foreign Minister in charge of that part
                    of the world, and the man who was in charge of bringing Soviet Jews out to
                    Israel, and the former Israeli ambassador in Moscow, etc. I told all of them
                    about this Congressional challenge. They were all horrified. The last thing they
                    wanted was for the VOA to start broadcasting in Hebrew, that's their language,
                    that's their job.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>So I came back loaded with this ammunition from my visit in Israel. And when the
                    meeting occurred, Ben Rosenthal said, “Well, what have you done?” I said, “The
                    first thing I did was go to Israel, and I met with the following people, and
                    here are the points which they made about our activities dealing with the Jewish
                    community in the Soviet Union.” It absolutely stunned these people. They just
                    collapsed. We did undertake an increase in programming about Jewish activities
                    in the United States in Russian. So we had a Jewish hour, and we increased that
                    and gave it more wattage and it went to different places. We even put a little
                    bit of that out to Uzbekistan because there was a small Jewish community out
                    there which is very influential and worth reaching. So we won that battle, and
                    it was the better part of wisdom. But it might never have happened, because we
                    do a lot of dumb things in this country because of domestic political
                    pressure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was basically coming from American politicians
                        wanting to show their Jewish constituents that they were doing
                        something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right. They wanted to hold up a coon's skin and say, here this is
                    what I accomplished. So I gave them a coon's skin, but it wasn't the one they
                    were talking about. It was a very successful initiative. I found that that
                    period was extremely interesting. It was a very tense time. We really did
                    believe that there was a good chance that the Soviets would try to go back into
                    Yugoslavia, recapture the one country which had broken out of their empire, and
                    that they could conceivably even reoccupy their one-third of Austria.</p>
                <p>So there was a Task Force, Mac Toon was sort of the executive director of it, and
                    I was the representative of USIA on the Task Force. We were all scurrying
                    around, what can we do? And, of course, the one thing we wanted to do was move
                    troops around, we wanted to send another division to NATO in Europe. The Defense
                    Department resisted any such psychological use of their divisions. They didn't
                    want to move troops, they don't like to move troops unless they're going to be
                    used, and it would be expensive in terms of their budget obviously, but it was a
                    way of sending a message to Brezhnev that he better not try to go beyond
                    Czechoslovakia. The only thing that I could offer up, was to plant the American
                    flag in a greatly increased number of cultural centers around Eastern Europe. We
                    all felt that the Soviets might not have gone into Hungary, for example in '56,
                    if they had thought they would meet international resistance. Subsequent
                    publication of documents indicate this fight did take place within the Politburo
                    at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was the political adviser to an American hospital, an
                        Army Hospital in '64. Oh, they like Americans. Did you have trouble with the
                        governments doing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>JENKINS: They knew exactly what we were doing, and they were delighted to get a
                    little bit of insurance. And secondly, as long as they could sell it to Moscow
                    as cultural, there was no objection. Now, I staffed a lot of these places with
                    State Department Foreign Service officers, but we had it out there, and I had a
                    lot of trouble, I thought very pedestrian administrative leadership in the
                    Department because they didn't like the idea of these things being opened up,
                    they wanted to get leaner, and get down to the Ellis Briggs kind of six-man
                    embassy. So I ended up providing USIA funding, with Shakespeare's blessing. We
                    would take a State Department FSO, and make him in Krakow our consul, but he was
                    really the Public Affairs officer, Victor Gray. We gave him Polish language
                    training, sent him in there, put the flag up, and had a reading room and
                    cultural activities, etc. And then the State Department felt they had control
                    because their man was there. Of course, I was their man, and I was in charge.
                    But the Admin person, Joan Clark, held a very narrow administrative approach to
                    things, and so I had a bureaucratic struggle to get this through, but I got it.
                    We opened a big cultural center in Budapest right next to the Russian
                    information center. We got it and turned the inside into a modern, highly
                    impressionistic American thing. The Romanians went crazy, it's still operating.
                    It's still drawing almost a thousand people a day. I call that the Jenkins
                    Memorial Library.</p>
                <p>This was a very successful program. I had somebody to go into Bratislava in
                    Slovakia. The Slovaks were very antsy about this because they were the ones who
                    were under Russian occupation, and we never were able to get them to agree. We
                    owned the building, which is now the American embassy again. When I went in to
                    inspect the building, as part of this, it was really kind of fun. I walked in
                    the door and everything was cobwebbed, etc. right on the city square, and here's
                    a great big photograph of Harry Truman. It had been closed down. That's where
                    Claiborne Pell served.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he was one of the young officers to open the place
                        up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right. Bratislava is only 45 minutes from Vienna. So those were
                    the kinds of programs that I was able to do, and I had very good people, John
                    Shirley in Warsaw, who subsequently became number three man in the agency, a top
                    career guy; Ed Alexander, just fine officers. Again, thanks to Frank giving me a
                    blank check.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problem as you went out on these
                        programs...let's talk about the Soviet Union itself. In those days we would
                        call it an empire, but it hadn't really penetrated our psyche that it really
                        was an empire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, it had penetrated the psyche of those of us who were dealing with
                    it, but not the American public.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any disquiet on the part of Great Russians who
                        were involved in our program? I'm talking about American Great Russians,
                        about what we were doing because obviously we're trying to get to where it
                        is today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Precisely. Well, I guess the answer to that is probably yes. We didn't
                    get a lot of flak because anything that we could do, was demonstrably
                    anti-communist. The concern of these people was overridingly to undermine,
                    overcome the communist regime. In terms of the ethnic groups in the United
                    States, the impact that they had on me in that five years when I was involved
                    with USIA's activities in that part of the world, invariably was more of what we
                    were doing. We tried to cut back because of budget pressures on some of the
                    Voice programs, and I went after Slovenia, for example. The number of Slovenes
                    who spoke nothing but Slovene was very small. But the Slovene-American
                    community, including the Congressman from Minnesota, John Blatnik, who had been
                    the liaison with Tito during the war, was so strong. Blatnik threatened to blow
                    me out of the water if I didn't sustain the Slovene broadcasts. I did get him to
                    agree to reduce it, and to do more English, but basically the pressure was
                    always to have more language services as a demonstration of our support for the
                    culture of these minority groups throughout central Europe. It was a resource

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the other countries...we're talking about the BBC,
                        DeutcheWelle, did you say, Okay, you've got Slovene, and we'll take Slovak,
                        or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I proposed that to Blatnik, for example, on Slovenia, and he'd hear
                    nothing of that. He wanted the American flag. So every six months I met with
                    BBC, I went to DeutcheWelle twice in six years. Kol Israel, as I mentioned, I
                    didn't deal with the French. I was aware of what they were doing, and I dealt
                    with the French embassy, but I didn't have that intimate a relationship. We
                    tried to dove-tail our activities with BBC vaguely. They were less constrained
                    that we, and could broadcast about developments in the world with more subtlety
                    and for that reason they had a better standing among the intelligentsia in
                    Europe basically. We were under a lot of pressure to make sure that whatever we
                    did had to do with U.S. foreign policy objectives. I didn't dispute that. I
                    thought it was more or less the right thing to be doing. I thought the BBC
                    frittered away a lot of time on cultural activities that had no political
                    message. I wanted our cultural activities to demonstrate the vibrancy of our
                    society, and not get into all this counter-culture stuff. The BBC was way out in
                    front on that. We subsequently were forced to do a certain amount of that
                    because of the uproar in this country about Vietnam, but it was always a
                    difficult balance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, BBC you might say was more dominated by, maybe
                        left-wing is not the right term, in fact more liberal probably...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Far more liberal than the population, no question about it. But even
                    there most of us could identify with what the BBC was doing intellectually. But
                    politically it seemed to us not to be as shaped, as directed, and therefore not
                    as justifiable in terms of taxpayers money going into it. But I got along very
                    well with them, and they did some things extremely well, and we helped one
                    another. There was never a sense of competition. We were all jammed equally by
                    the Soviet authorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the DeutcheWelle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I thought the DeutcheWelle was jammed heavily. It was directed at the
                    Volksdeutsch, the German emigre population in Russia and throughout the Soviet
                    Union there were pockets where German settlers had gone in the 1800s mostly.
                    They were not in a league, frankly, in terms of political sophistication. Some
                    very good people there but...the objective of Soviet policy, we saw ourselves as
                    shaping the Soviets, the Germans saw themselves as deflecting Soviet efforts to
                    shape them. And throughout this period we all recognized that Germany was the
                    most important battleground between east and west. But as a battleground, you
                    have a different perspective on what you're trying to do. So it was a different
                    function. Kol Israel was a very targeted special intriguing thing. Just
                    generally speaking, the western broadcasts meshed together rather well. There
                    was no conflict that I was aware of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Japanese? Were they doing anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: ...not doing anything to my knowledge, and I think I'm correct, they may
                    be doing it now. In the first place there are no Japanese speakers in the Soviet
                    Union. They have I'm sure now an international broadcasting program in Japanese,
                    and in English probably. I felt world-wide English was very marginal to what we
                    were trying to do in that part of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Should we move now, you went to H, which is Congressional

                <p>JENKINS: That was a fluke...</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, in 1973. It happened that I had sort of run the course as Assistant
                    Director of USIA after 5 years, and I was getting restless. My wife had died,
                    and I wanted to be challenged more than I was at that time. The Director had
                    become Jim Keogh. I felt very good about working with Jim, he's a splendid man,
                    much more high-minded I might say, and less driven, than Frank Shakespeare. A
                    very good manager, gentle, but strong, and open. He understood things, and he
                    didn't come in with an agenda. Frank had arrived with a very strong internal
                    compass. Jim came in more as an intellectually challenged, and an intrigued
                    journalist, which is what he had been. He had been at Time. Very conservative,
                    very solid, but much easier to work with than Frank. And he continued the
                    support that Frank had initiated for my part of the world. Jim became a very
                    close friend, and is to this day. He agreed, I had been there five years, it was
                    time to move on, I had an excellent deputy in line to take over from me, John
                    Shirley.</p>
                <p>One day I was going over to lunch at the State Department, and I ran into
                    Marshall Wright on the street corner. Marshall had studied Arabic when I studied
                    Russian at FSI and we'd known each other a little bit. He had become Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Congressional Relations under Secretary Bill Rogers. He
                    was looking for a deputy, and on the street he said, “What the hell are you
                    doing now?” I said, “I'm looking around,” in fact I was going to see Fred Ikl�
                    to see about becoming Fred's deputy at ACDA, Arms Control. I was very interested
                    in the subject matter. I did have that interview with Fred. Marshall said,
                    “Look, I'd like to talk to you, come see me after you see Fred.” I had a very
                    long sort of convoluted interview with Fred, a splendid academic and a very
                    bright man, but he's very internalized, not easy to talk to, not easy to
                    understand, and I didn't feel the chemistry was terribly good. I have great
                    respect for Fred to this day, but we would not have had a swinging operation
                    together. That's not his style, for one thing, although the subject matter
                    certainly intrigued me, and always did.</p>
                <p>So I went to see Marshall, and Marshall became very enthusiastic. I had been
                    active with Congress at USIA, and had testified a lot, and had a lot of friends
                    on the Hill. And, I had always cultivated the CODEL job. When I was abroad I
                    always sought to be the CODEL man because I enjoyed, and found it stimulating to
                    interact with these Congressmen when they're abroad. You get their full
                    attention for two days, that's a big piece of their time. I built a lot of
                    friendships that way. Some people I never wanted to see again. But on the whole
                    the members of Congress were extremely good value, and worthwhile. I talked this
                    way with Marshall. He stood up, he said, “Look, go no further, come with me.” We
                    went down the hall and met Bill Rogers, the Secretary, and talked for about
                    ten-fifteen minutes. Then Marshall took me over to the White House to meet Bill
                    Timmons. And the next day offered me the job. Jim Keogh was very enthusiastic
                    about it, and so I moved.</p>

                        Relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: '73 to '78, five years.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you put in context in the '73 period when you took
                        over this job, what did Congressional Relations do in the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, under Marshall and me, we began to change H into an effective
                    foreign policy instrument which was our interpretation of what it should be.
                    Heretofore, and subsequently, it has been more or less a conveyor belt for
                    Congressmen to lean on the State Department. It has been peopled by former
                    staffers who came with an absolute Congressional perspective, not a State
                    Department perspective. We had the State Department perspective. So the belt ran
                    the other way under us. That was the first thing.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the issues of the day were intimidating, and so important, that we
                    didn't have a lot of resistance from the front office to getting involved, and
                    getting them involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The front office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Congress had intruded into foreign policy, as a result of Watergate and
                    the collapse of Vietnam, increasingly into the day-to-day operations of foreign
                    policy. The relationship between the Department and the Hill, became absolutely
                    critical. And we were in the middle of it. I had a perception as to what (and I
                    think my perception was right), Congressmen wanted, and would be effective with
                    them, and that would further the interest of the foreign policy of the United
                    States. Marshall agreed with me that Congressmen should (and generally preferred
                    to) talk to experts, not former Hill staffers. There is a strong sense on the
                    Hill, and it hasn't changed even with the recent revolution, of doctor-nurse.
                    The doctor is the member, and the nurse is the staff, and you never climb that
                    barrier entirely. Some staffers become Congressmen, but not many. As a career
                    Foreign Service officer, and Marshall also a career Foreign Service officer, H
                    became a different place. Larry Pezzulo, another FSO, joined the office, was
                    perceived in Congress as professional.</p>
                <p>I organized a series of groups, and meetings, etc., to bring in our ambassadors
                    who were back on home leave, or the Assistant Secretary, almost always career
                    people, not political appointees, because that's who these people want to hear
                    from. So we were much better able to sell our position. We generated much more
                    respect, and Congress didn't try to bully us. For example, if I took a political
                    appointee, with no particular background in say Japanese affairs, to talk about
                    Japan, Congress didn't regard us with any particular deference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they knew where you came from.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>JENKINS: But if I took Bill Sherman up, and they knew Bill had spent 20 years
                    dealing with the Japanese, and was bilingual in the language, they immediately
                    became very respectful of him, and his views were much more persuasive. I
                    organized one thing with Dante Fascell, who was the then...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Congressman from Florida.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: ...who became the number two man at that time, subsequently became
                    chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. We persuaded Dante that it
                    would be worthwhile trying a program, the first Wednesday morning of every month
                    to have a coffee hour from 7:30 or 8:00 to 9:00, in a hearing room. I would
                    provide a current official on whatever subject was then on the front burner. But
                    always career people. When we started out we'd get 12 or 15 members of Congress
                    for an hour. That was a big accomplishment. By the time I finished, and we did
                    this for about four years, we were drawing 100 members. I'd take up the
                    ambassador just back from Sudan where we had just had a terrible incident, and
                    these people would turn out in droves. No staffers, members only, they were not
                    ashamed to ask dumb questions because their staff wasn't there. So we had a very
                    free-flowing exchange, and as a result of that we had a real impact on
                    Congressional attitudes toward our policy objectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's all very well to say, okay, we're only going to take
                        career people, but you've got political appointees with big egos who maybe
                        had been put in charge of East Asian or Middle East, or what have you. How
                        did you deal with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I just didn't invite them, unless they were somebody who had great
                    personal standing. Win Lord is a political appointee, but he has great knowledge
                    of Asia and he's accepted as an Asian expert. If you had an Assistant Secretary
                    who in fact was a former staffer on the Hill, like Eliot Abrams, this would not
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you avoid...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: It was my program, I took who I wanted to take, and I had Henry's
                    support absolutely on this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about Henry Kissinger.</hi>

                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes. And before that Bill Rogers, and even after that Vance—I stayed for
                    about six months under Vance. I didn't get any pressure from them to take any
                    specific people. As long as Fascell was happy, and the members were happy, and
                    we got rave notices. I mean, the members would write notes to the Secretary
                    commending ambassador so-and-so, or Joe so-and-so who is the deputy assistant
                    secretary. I took a lot of DASs because they were all career people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: DAS, Deputy Assistant Secretary. What you were doing was,
                        you were taking away the political element.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, administrations get involved with something. If
                        you put the Assistant Secretary on you're going to get the party line, but
                        if you have a professional Foreign Service officer who is dealing with it,
                        it's at a different level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Exactly, that's exactly right. And this was an extremely successful
                    thing. We had some shoot-outs over nominations. Harry Shlaudeman was always
                    controversial because of his presence in Chile when Allende was overthrown.
                    There were some professional liberals in Congress who were trying to nail
                    somebody to prove that we were responsible for the assassination of Allende
                    (which I'm convinced we weren't). Harry is a very close friend of mine, we were
                    classmates in the Foreign Service, and I've known him forever, a splendid guy.
                    As a result of this, somewhere around 100 members of the House had a sense of a
                    personal relationship with an officer on an issue which was of interest to
                    everybody. So if they had questions about what's going on in the Congo, for
                    example, and I think it was John Reinhardt I took up on that issue, it may have
                    been Bill Schaufele. Subsequently they would feel free to call Schaufele
                    directly. That's effective communication. That's extremely effective. Instead of
                    writing a letter to the Secretary and getting a letter back after its been
                    cleared by 40 people, you had this informal dialogue. Nobody is clearing
                    anything. The Congressman calls up, and said to Schaufele—this is
                    theoretical—”Well, Bill, I've read what's happening down there, and it looks to
                    me like we ought to stop supporting this son of a bitch, he's dribbling away all
                    the resources we've sent, and he's a terrible fascist. What do you think? Give
                    me your personal view.” Well Schaufele, right off the top of his head, having
                    met this Member before, would give him the personal view. The Member would then
                    be equipped to argue and vote intelligently. And that's what they want. They
                    want to look like they know what they're doing, because they really care. Most
                    Congressmen are dead sincere, their interest in foreign policy is sincere, and
                    they're intrigued by it. It's a very sexy subject on the Hill, and we should be
                    able to, in the Department, to exploit this natural friendly interested
                    organization. So instead of being at loggerheads all the time, on most of the
                    issues we'd be running in the same direction.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you run into bureaucratic unhappiness about this
                        type of thing in the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: You know, I always rode very high above the water in the Department in
                    dealing with bureaucracy. I always was sublimely confident that what I was doing
                    was well received, and that therefore my colleagues in the State Department
                    would be proud to be part of it. And generally speaking I found that to be the
                    case. I found some political appointees who were jealous, and wanted to be in
                    charge. Some of the bureau Assistant Secretaries wanted to run their own
                    program. That's a very difficult line for H always. Do you permit an Assistant
                    Secretary for Middle Eastern Affairs to go up on the Hill and develop his own
                    contacts? Or do you try and control it and make it all go through H? Obviously
                    for purposes of making sure that American policy priorities are being accurately
                    reflected, coordination is extremely important. But the way to coordinate is not
                    to try to lay down an edict and say, you can't do this, I'll do it, or, you'll
                    only do it with me. What I did was to persuade each bureau to assign a man as
                    special assistant to the Assistant Secretary who became my liaison in EB, for
                    example, or EUR. They came to my staff meetings once a week. I trained those
                    guys, I seduced them into recognizing the importance of Congressional Relations,
                    and sensitized them to it. So that they became my voice in the EB meeting. I
                    would frequently go to the bureau staff meetings and brief on what was
                    happening. But I always had this one person who was the EB man for H in the
                    meetings reporting on what we were doing, and bringing them up to date. As a
                    consequence I was able to overcome this artificial bureaucratic division. And
                    everybody found H extremely responsive to the policy issues they cared about,
                    not the bureaucratic control concept. And that's what I tried to create, and I
                    think it was successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think the bureaucratic control would show up, the
                        telephone, the briefing, this is great because you really get the message
                        across. As soon as something gets on paper, it goes through that horrible
                        process of everybody gets a crack at it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, that's true, but again because I had such a good intimate working
                    relationship with the bureaus, and remember I was of them, I was an FSO. I came
                    out of EUR, and I had served in ARA, and EA, and they all knew me, they all
                    recognized that I was one of them. I wasn't some former Congressional staffer or
                    White House staffer trying to tell them “how to suck eggs.” When something went
                    onto paper, and I signed everything that went to the Hill from the Department—it
                    was signed either by me or for a brief period Linwood Holton who was the
                    Assistant Secretary (I was his deputy), and then Bob McCloskey who was also the
                    titular Assistant Secretary, when he was there, signed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he was mainly a spokesman wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, he was more spokesman, and then he went off as ambassador to
                    Greece. Of the five years that I was there, I was the Acting Assistant Secretary
                    for about three and a half years. And everybody in the building regarded me as
                    the sort of constant H, a fixture. And that wasn't because I was outstanding, it
                    was because I couldn't go overseas. My wife had died and I was raising my
                    children, so I stayed in Washington longer than I normally would have as a
                    Foreign Service officer. But that continuity was very valuable in trying to lay
                    the groundwork for this kind of an appreciation, I think, and everybody that I
                    know has told me this over and over again, that when we ran H, Wright, McCloskey
                    and me (and we had Larry Pezzulo and Sam Goldberg), we were all career people.
                    We had a few political appointees, Bill Richardson interestingly enough,
                    currently a Congressman from New Mexico, a wonderful guy, was a political
                    appointee. He was sent to me, from all things, by the Republican Study Group.
                    He's now a Democratic Congressman. Bill is a very bright man. He's a Fletcher
                    graduate, and of course he's bilingual. His mother was Mexican, his father was
                    an American. He has a lovely attractive blond wife, and they're a very good
                    Congress team. I recognized immediately that Bill was a weapon for us in ARA.
                    When I sent him off to Mexico as part of the advance team for Kissinger's first
                    visit to Mexico, he was an instant hit. He knew everybody in Mexico. He arranged
                    all the programs, and ended up accompanying Henry every place. And it put him on
                    the map, and it demonstrated to Henry again that, you know, “I can trust H.”
                    They have good people. But he was the only political appointee that I remember,
                    everybody else was Foreign Service when I was there. Now that has totally gone
                    the other way. It began under Carter when they brought in people from Eagleton's
                    office to run it, Brian Atwood was one, Doug Bennet was another. They are very
                    smart guys. They have since become members of the foreign policy establishment,
                    but they came in without the Department's perspective. They were not trusted
                    within the Department by career people, and so the whole thing began to break
                    down. They began to fill up the office with appointees. Now it's Barbara
                    Wikulski, former AA, who is Assistant Secretary and practically no FSOs. I think
                    they've lost it. And they're now in charge of nominations and making sure the
                    Secretary is happy, which is what H had historically had been. We had turned it
                    into a policy instrument.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the major areas where Congress and State
                        Department were going in different directions? If you can give any examples
                        of how H and you operated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Let me explain the context. This was the time of the collapse in
                    Vietnam. Kissinger had just come over from the NSC. It was the time of
                    Watergate. The President resigned while we were there. The Congress in this
                    period was increasingly assertive in foreign policy, trying to take over
                    everything, trying to turn everything upside down. They were very hostile to
                    military assistance, for example. One of our major jobs was to try and keep the
                    pipeline to Vietnam open long enough so that we could withdraw with some degree
                    of satisfaction. And we worked very hard on that. We didn't succeed, but how do
                    you measure success. The pipeline was kept open longer than if we hadn't been
                    working on it. Whether I felt it was right or wrong, that was the policy (I also
                    happened to think it was right at the time).</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>We had the SALT agreement with the Soviet Union, which was very contentious. We
                    had the Panama Canal treaty which was extremely contentious. We had our
                    relationship with Chile which was very contentious. Relations with China. All of
                    these things were big issues. The Congress was floundering around. They didn't
                    really have a direction on these issues. Congress, in the first place, is not a
                    homogeneous organization. It's 535 individual future potential Presidents of the
                    United States, and they all have their own agenda and perspective. So the
                    challenge was always to bring together a coalition of supporters to preserve the
                    administration's policy position. And we were more or less successful. When you
                    think back to the Watergate era, when everything in the administration was being
                    blown apart, nobody really ever laid a glove on foreign policy, or Henry
                    Kissinger. We got pushed out of Vietnam, but we were trying to get out of
                    Vietnam anyhow. That wasn't really a difference. The difference was timing. We
                    had a majority in favor of the Panama Canal treaty, and it won eventually, with
                    bipartisan support by Presidents of both parties, from four administrations.
                    SALT was another matter of the same kind. The whole issue of detente with the
                    Soviet Union through the Brezhnev era well after the invasion of
                    Czechoslovakia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And before the invasion of Afghanistan in '79.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right. It was never a situation where the administration wanted
                    this, and Congress was opposed to it. Congress was never unified, the
                    administration's position at that point wasn't all that clear frequently anyhow.
                    We were trying to stay on top of a collapsing situation, and maintain the
                    dignity and respect and influence of the United States, in spite of an
                    historically unprecedented political crisis. I think Henry Kissinger's State
                    Department succeeded, and I was proud to be a part of that. I found Henry a
                    tremendous Secretary. One of the things when you're doing Congressional
                    Relations is you've got to have somebody they care about. I would not want to be
                    doing Congressional Relations for Warren Christopher. I know Warren Christopher.
                    He was the deputy when I was there for eight months. I've great respect for his
                    intellectual capacity, his ability to analyze and focus and negotiate. But he's
                    a lousy proponent, ineffective, not because he doesn't try but he just can't do
                    it. It's not there chemically. Kissinger was great theater. Everybody on the
                    Hill wanted Henry for their hearing. And anytime I would invite a group of
                    Congressmen for breakfast with Henry Kissinger, they'd all come. Now if you
                    invite people for breakfast with Warren Christopher, I imagine they're too busy.
                    It's a totally different ball game. So I realize I was blessed in having Henry
                    as a product. Henry appreciated, next to the press, he considered the Congress
                    the most important instrument that he had. And he worked it very hard, and very
                    well, very intelligently. E.g., I introduced him to Russell Long. Russell Long
                    was chairman of the Finance Committee, normally the object of the Treasury
                    Department. Henry immediately recognized that Russell Long was a power house, a
                    real “baron,” and he liked him. He's a scoundrel, like Henry is a scoundrel. The
                    chemistry was terrific between the two of them. I brought them together. I got
                    Henry up to testify before his committee on an international economic issue.
                    Long liked him a lot, was very grateful. Subsequently I got Long down to the
                    Department for breakfast with Henry two or three times. They worked together
                    extremely well, and he was a great ally. Henry was also very close to Javits,
                    and Humphrey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Javits was a Republican senator.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: And Ted Kennedy liked him a lot, they had a good relationship. There
                    wasn't a single member of Congress that I can think of, with a few exceptions,
                    who really had it in for Henry. They all enjoyed his company. Senator Jackson
                    was a problem because of Richard Perle...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Scoop Jackson, of Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>JENKINS: The chemistry was bad there. It was bad because Jackson was ponderous,
                    very heavy handed, absolutely hostile to any collaboration with the Russians. He
                    did not accept the idea of subverting Soviet hegemony by expanding contact, and
                    increasing American influence to the maximum degree. He wanted isolation, cut
                    off relations with the Russians. And that was driven by Richard Perle, and
                    Dickie Fosdick, who's a charming woman, a good friend for whom I have great
                    respect but I think is dead wrong, a negative force, motives were very
                    high-minded, but I thought dead wrong. Eliot Abrams was just sort of the errand
                    boy in that office with Dickie Fosdick at that time. And they were driving
                    Jackson, persuading him to be very hostile. And Henry had a very contentious
                    relationship with Jackson, and I was very much involved in the middle of that at
                    all times. We did get MFN for Romania, because the Romanians came through on
                    Jewish immigration, and that was a big item. Jackson wanted to be President, and
                    he thought he was going to get there with Jewish financing in this country. He
                    was absolutely a slave to Israeli positions, in my judgment. Richard was a big
                    part of that. That was, I'd say, one of the few people who really had it in for
                    Henry. Doc Morgan, Clem Zablocki, Dante Fascell, all of the senior Democrats in
                    this Republican administration had great affection and respect for Kissinger,
                    trusted him. Wayne Hayes was a power house on that committee. He was in charge
                    of the State Department authorization bill, and was a big force within Congress.
                    As chairman of the administration committee he controlled all the perks. I dealt
                    with Hayes a lot.</p>
                <p>A typical little anecdote on how you get things done: Hayes' secretary called me
                    and said that it was his birthday, and there was going to be a little fund
                    raiser for him, but it was cast as a birthday party in the hearing room. Doc
                    Morgan, Zablocki, and Hayes all wondered whether there was any chance the
                    Secretary could show up, even though it was a Democratic function, etc. I
                    immediately saw this as an opportunity. If we could get Hayes really in the
                    traces for us, it would be a big thing. He'd been difficult, nice to me but he
                    didn't like the Department too much. So I wrote a memo to Henry. Linwood Holton
                    was then the Assistant Secretary and he was out of the country for a week. In
                    the memo I reported the telephone conversation, my recommendation was that this
                    is too good an opportunity to miss. For a short appearance we will get influence
                    with Hayes which I think would be of value to us down the line on issue after
                    issue. Approve - Disapprove, sent it up, it came back approved, set it up, take
                    me up there. Holton returned before it happened, I mean after the memo but
                    before the event. I had it on his desk as things that had happened while he was
                    away. He blew up. He said, “You can't do this. You can't send a Republican
                    Secretary of State up to a Democratic fund raiser.” I said, “It's being cast as
                    a birthday party, and Henry clearly has agreed with this. He's not a dumb man,
                    he understands this. And I think you're wrong.” He said, “Well, I'm going up
                    there and turn this around.” So he grabbed the paper and walked up to Henry's
                    office, and came back chest fallen. Henry was going to go. Holton did not like
                    me for that. But I took Henry up there. He got up on the piano bench in front of
                    about 150 Democratic Congressmen and Senators, Humphrey was there, and Tip
                    O'Neill, the whole Democratic establishment was there, and Henry stood up and
                    said, “Look, I'm here as an outsider in this party, but I want to put on the
                    record right now my appreciation for the fact that Wayne Hayes is one of the
                    great parliamentary diplomats in the history of our country, and I tip my hat to
                    you.” And he left.</p>

                <p>The next morning Hayes got on the phone, “Jenkins, I don't know how you did that,
                    but I want you to know that anything the Secretary of State wants from here on
                    out, you've got me working for it,” and hung up. So I thought, that's great,
                    that's what we expected. I told Henry and he was very pleased. Six weeks went
                    by, and all of a sudden this tremendous wave of hostility toward any military
                    involvement in anything hit the military assistance legislation. The amendment
                    was introduced to strip out all of the financial support for Korea, military
                    assistance, and bring our troops home. And it was rolling through the House. It
                    looked like we were going to lose this big. Phil Habib was the Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary, and Phil was screaming, what are we going to do? I took him up there
                    and everybody was just shaking their heads, etc. We worked it as hard as we
                    could and we got it down to about 15 members who were swing votes. And if we
                    could get 12 of those 15, we could block this amendment, but it looked like it
                    was a very long shot. And I reported this. Henry had a staff meeting every
                    morning at 7:30, I would go to most of the, if McCloskey wasn't there I always
                    went. I was reporting on this on a daily basis. Everybody was very concerned. It
                    looked like we were going to lose something which strategically would have been
                    of historic significance. So I said in one of these meetings, “It looks to me,
                    Mr. Secretary, that this is an opportunity to cash in the Wayne Hayes card. So
                    if you agree, and Phil, I know you agree, I'd like to go up and talk to Wayne
                    about this. We've got this list of 15 people.” So I went up to see Wayne, I
                    walked in and he said, “Oh, good to see you. I told you, and I want you to know
                    I mean it.” I said, “Well, I'm here to cash that chip in. I realize that what
                    we're asking is maybe impossible but here's the issue.” I told him where the
                    legislation stood, he was familiar with it. He said, “I worried about that,” he
                    was very much of a hard liner basically which helped our position on this one.
                    He said, “Let me see that list.” So he looked down the list, he just went down
                    checking off names, and at the end of it he looked up at me and said, “You go
                    back and tell Henry Kissinger that these sons of bitches will vote with him on
                    this issue, or they won't park within 12 miles of the capital building.” We got
                    12 out of 15 and we won the vote. Now that's Congressional influence.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, of course, had we pulled out of there, we could have
                        started a war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Oh, no question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having served not too long thereafter in Korea, if we'd
                        pulled our troops out of there, this was not a minor issue. We're talking
                        about a big war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, it's a dramatic illustration of how Congressional relations should
                    work, to my mind. And I was thrilled that Kissinger had this sense. He was
                    consistently outstanding on the Hill, and everybody wanted him all the time.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've talked about how you used our FSOs with Congress.
                        How did you view, and how did you work with the staff of Congress? This was
                        a period where the staff was beginning to basically get too big for its
                        britches, and was often considered to be running the show. We're talking
                        about the Congressional staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: That still goes on to a certain extent. It's not as simple as that, and
                    that's not inaccurate. A part of knowing how to work the Hill was knowing who
                    the important staffers are. Just as knowing who the important members are. There
                    are probably 300 of the 535 members of the Congress and the Senate who aren't
                    worth talking to on foreign policy issues. But the others are very important,
                    and then when you talk to them you have to analyze each one, and his staff, and
                    who on his staff is important. I had a working relationship with Scott Cohen,
                    who was Chuck Percy's right-hand man, chief of staff of the Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee. Scott is a very good friend of mine, and I befriended
                    Scott, was open with him, shared things with him, we socialized together. I did
                    that with probably 20 people up there, people who remain friends of mine. Marion
                    Carnecki in the House, and I did it irrespective of party. I had Republican
                    friends, and Democratic friends, and I trained our FSOs to recognize that it is
                    important to identify who the real initiator of an idea is, and to focus in on
                    him irrespective of whether it's the member or the staff. To recognize that the
                    staff is an incredibly important part of this process. And I did that with
                    Kissinger. I had two or three beer hours for staffers with Kissinger. They were
                    thrilled out of their skins. And Henry recognized this, he had that sense, and
                    he trusted me. When I would bring in 15 staffers and say to him, “You can be
                    candid with these people.” He'd say, “I don't trust them, they will go to the
                    newspapers.” I said, “Look, you'll go to the newspapers before they do, and you
                    have much better access. There's no way they're going to distort the issue that
                    way, and furthermore the main interest they have is in being with you, seeing
                    you, listening to you, not trying to screw you.” And he took it, and he went
                    with it.</p>
                <p>We were caught up on the Cyprus issue with Brademas and Sarbanes, I failed there.
                    It was case in point where I misread something. Both John Brademas and Sarbanes
                    are very well educated. Sarbanes, John, of course, became president of NYU among
                    other things, and was a Harvard graduate. And I thought the two of them, and
                    Henry with his academic background, would have a lot of good chemistry together,
                    and they did until we got on the issue of Cyprus. It was a total
                    non-conversation, they went ballistic. And Henry was furious with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we're talking about the ethnic card there. Greek
                        descent...some are very good friends, and I served four years in Athens.
                        There's no rationality, and this was with Greek-Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>JENKINS: No, none. They're more Greek than the Greeks, and AHEPA just killed us
                    on the Cyprus issue. That was an ethnic organization where we really struck out.
                    It didn't affect me in terms of my Soviet activities, or activities dealing with
                    the Soviets, but it was critical in the H job where we were trying to contain
                    the Cyprus issue and get military assistance into Turkey which at that point was
                    probably the most valuable single military ally we had in NATO. They were
                    getting very short shift in terms of military assistance because the
                    Greek-American community didn't want them to get anything. So that was a
                    negative impact, and of course, the Israeli issue was always very tough too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk a little about the Israelis? We're talking
                        about the Jewish lobby.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I was involved in the Jackson-Vanik amendment. It's one I lost but I had
                    never thought I could win. The White House was confident that they were going to
                    be able to pull this off. There was a man named Peter...but that's not right,
                    who was the director of international economic policy on the White House staff,
                    a very cocky guy, and he was dead wrong on this reading of Congress usually. He
                    found a few token members in Congress, and Max Fisher from Detroit who is sort
                    of the head of the Jewish community in Detroit, who was a Republican, and a few
                    others who all assured them that they could blunt the Jackson-Vanik
                    amendment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the Jackson-Vanik amendment
                        was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: The Jackson-Vanik amendment was an effort by some key staffers, most
                    notably Richard Perle, and Charlie Vanik's staffer Mark Talisman, who drafted
                    this thing which made an economic relationship, including trade, MFN most
                    notably, dependent upon the immigration practices of the recipient country. It
                    was directed specifically at the Soviets, trying to force the Soviets to open up
                    and permit Soviet Jewry to flee to Israel, not the United States, but to Israel,
                    which is one of the things that gave me a problem with it. They were able to
                    mobilize the Jewish community in this country, all the temples across the
                    country had big signs out in front: Save Soviet Jewry. And because the Jewish
                    community is highly political, and puts its money where its mouth is on politics
                    like no other ethnic group in this country they were able to influence Congress,
                    like the NRA does. Congress was scared to death of these organizations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The NRA is the National Rifle Association.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>JENKINS: What they did successfully was mobilize support for the Jackson-Vanik
                    amendment which was a direct insult to the Soviets. In the meantime Henry had
                    been negotiating with Dobrynin and Gromyko to bring about a more liberal policy.
                    Some 64,000 Jews left the Soviet Union the year before Jackson-Vanik was passed.
                    The year after it passed, it went down to 200. I was arguing that this was not
                    going to help Soviet Jewry, it might make Jews in the United States feel like
                    they'd done something, but it was not going to really help Jews in the Soviet
                    Union. It was going to be counterproductive. I got no place because the lobby
                    was so powerful, and I told Henry, “We're going to lose this.” He was very upset
                    about it, had a lot of meetings with Jackson, but we couldn't get anyplace.
                    Jackson was running for President and he was dependent upon Jewish financial
                    support which he saw as his key to being President. So it was a very bad issue.
                    We were running against the tide, we were weakened because of Watergate,
                    Vietnam, and all these other things. We did not have as much prestige as we
                    would have had otherwise. The President had zero prestige on this issue. And we
                    got killed.</p>
                <p>The ExIm Bank's ability to make loans to the Soviet Union as part of the detente
                    process, which was underway at that time, was clipped because there was a
                    Stevenson amendment that was added. Adlai Stevenson sponsored it, which Perle
                    engineered, which not only said, you couldn't get MFN, but you also couldn't get
                    any more than $400 million in ExIm Bank loan guarantees. This shut off any
                    possibility of significant American investment in the Soviet Union, which we
                    were promoting because we thought if we could get consumer industries going in
                    there, we're going to undermine the Soviet regime. It's the same thing we were
                    doing at USIA.</p>
                <p>The President put Bill Simon in charge of the East-West Trade, or Economic, Task
                    Force, Simon being the Secretary of Treasury, a very cocky guy, very smart, but
                    very cocky. Kissinger always regarded Simon as an upstart. He had no business
                    getting into relations with the Soviet Union. Simon would call a Cabinet level
                    meeting, and Henry would send me as a deliberate insult. I would go to the
                    meeting, and here would be Secretary Simon in the chair at the head this table
                    in his little private dining room; Jerry Parsky, his staff aide who was an Under
                    Secretary sitting next to him; George Shultz from Labor; and Earl Butz from
                    Agriculture; and half a dozen other Cabinet members, and I'd walk in the door
                    and Simon would say obtusely so everybody could hear, “Who's that guy?” Parsky
                    would say, “That's Kempton Jenkins, he's Kissinger's representative.” “What's he
                    do?” “He's the Acting Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations. He's a
                    Russian expert.” Christ! Simon would go purple he'd be so upset. Well, I'd sit
                    there quietly while these fellows started out the conversation, and within ten
                    minutes they were asking questions about what the lay of the land in Congress
                    was on this issue, and, of course, I was the only one in the room that knew
                    anything about it. I did all the talking by the end of the meeting. I'd have to
                    go back and tell Henry, and he would laugh like hell. And Simon would send a
                    note over saying, “I will not accept anything other than principals.” And so it
                    was a very confrontational relationship, Henry had with Simon.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>But this was an issue that I was the point man on, Eagleburger got involved in
                    this, he was then Henry's Special Assistant, before he moved up to other things.
                    That was an issue where we took a beating. But it was not a product of Watergate
                    so much as it was the ethnic lobby.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you run across the ethnic thing, at this point we're
                        talking about the Greek and the Jewish lobby.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right, and they are really serious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wait until we get to the Korean lobby some day.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, we're not there yet, it will take another 20 years probably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It'll come.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Those are challenges for American Presidents, and Secretaries of State.
                    You have to work with them, you have to deal with it, you have to be responsive
                    to it, because it's sincere, it's not fictitious. It just troubles me always
                    because it wasn't the U.S. national interest they were concerned about, it was
                    Israel's national interest, or Greece's national interests. And I felt that
                    while those national interests were allied to ours, they needed to be
                    subordinate, not driving. I think I maintained a reasonably good dialogue. I
                    always had good access to the Israeli lobby.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>Steve Bryen, who was a colleague of Perle's, was Cliff Case's man on the Senate
                    Foreign Relations Committee. One incident that occurred was very interesting
                    where we all worked together. We were trying to sell Jordan some Hawk missiles,
                    and of course the Israeli lobby didn't want that because they didn't want any
                    Hawk missiles pointed at Israel that could be used against Israeli forces in the
                    event of another Arab-Israeli war. And yet, the Jordanians had a legitimate
                    reason, we were trying to wean Jordan into our camp on that old part of the
                    world, and with some success. And King Hussein was a hero then, as he is today,
                    in his ability to survive. So we went back and forth, and Case was killing us in
                    the committee on this thing, and I finally went to Steve and I said, “Steve, you
                    know we've got to be able to work this out. You're not really afraid of the
                    Jordanians with or without Hawks. It's the Syrians and the Egyptians you're
                    worried about, right?” “Why can't we work something out here?” He said, “Well,
                    maybe we can.” So Steve and I worked out this gimmick, that we'd sell the Hawks,
                    but the Hawks had to be emplaced in concrete pointing towards Syria, so they
                    couldn't be turned around. They had fixed launching pads. And it worked. We got
                    the damned thing through. Kissinger saw the wisdom of this. He stopped by and
                    chatted with Case privately on it, and we got the bill through. And that's the
                    kind of Congressional relations which is constructive. I still consider Steve a
                    friend of mine. He's outrageous in terms of his devotion to Israel, I think. But
                    he's a nice guy, I like him. He gets pleasure out of the game, as Richard Perle
                    did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You moved into the Carter administration in '77 for what,
                        about six months?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes. When Ford lost the election, Habib called me in and said, “Look,
                    they're not going to let you stay.” And I'd been Acting Assistant Secretary at
                    this point, and in fact Henry was getting ready to make me Assistant Secretary,
                    that was the deal. Eagleburger called me in, and said, “Henry will make you
                    Assistant Secretary, but you have to take this woman that we're trying to place
                    as your deputy.” Her name was Martha Taft. She's a splendid woman. I had never
                    met her. He said, “I want you to talk to her.” So we chatted for about an hour,
                    and I came away convinced that she'd be terrific. And I told Larry, he said,
                    “Okay, that's the deal. You take Martha. You like her, you agree she's good,
                    you'll be the Assistant Secretary.” Well, along comes the election, and Ford
                    loses the election. Henry said, “I don't want to make you Assistant Secretary
                    because if I do you're going to be kicked out, if you stay as Acting Assistant
                    Secretary, when they come in you'll still be there, and if that's in the
                    national interest, you stay.” And Habib called me and said, “Look, you ought to
                    get out of there. You're never going to get the top job.” Clem Zablocki said, “I
                    will make you Assistant Secretary in the Democratic administration.” I had a lot
                    of support in both Houses. Gale McGee in the Senate. Phil said, “They can't do
                    it. They may think they can, but they can't. Be realistic, get out. Take your
                    embassy now, and go.” He said, “How would you like to go to Bangkok? You've
                    served in Bangkok.” Well, my wife had been dead at this point three-five years,
                    and my children were all in a school. I had met a widow whom I subsequently
                    married, and it was just the wrong time to leave town. It was too important to
                    bring our families together, etc. So I said, “I'll stay and take my chances.” He
                    said, “You're making a mistake, if you don't like Bangkok, we'll give you
                    something else. How would you like Hungary?” I look back on it and I'm really
                    sorry I didn't take it, in a way, but in terms of the family it was clearly the
                    right thing to do. I didn't have a choice. It was the right thing to do.</p>
                <p>So I stayed. The last week Henry was there at my suggestion, we organized a party
                    for him on the eighth floor, we invited the whole Congress to come. They damned
                    near all came. It was a fabulous party, a big success. Henry honored me. He had
                    Lucy and I go down to his office on the seventh floor, and with Nancy we rode up
                    on the elevator with him, and we got off into the crowd together, we set up the
                    receiving line, I stood in the line next to Henry. It was his sort of payoff.
                    And on the way up he said in the elevator to Lucy, “You know it's hard for me to
                    say anything good about a Foreign Service officer, but at least you get somebody
                    who is loyal and knows what he's doing, and on balance your husband has been a
                    splendid asset.” That was big. And then we got out and had this terrific
                    party.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Well, when Vance and Christopher came in with the Carter administration, Doug
                    Bennet was named as the Assistant Secretary to be, but it took almost eight
                    months for him to get through the process. The Carter White House was like this
                    one, really inefficient on terms of clearances, etc. So I was acting with Brian
                    Atwood, and Bennet waiting in the wings with Bob Beckel. All staffers. When I
                    told them about this big party that we'd had for Henry, they said, “Let's have
                    one for Vance.” So we organized the party for Vance, and I found out what the
                    calendar was and said, “Don't do it on Tuesday evening because they're going to
                    have a 5:00 meeting of the new Democratic caucus, and I was told that's when the
                    Secretary is available, that's when the party will be. They'll come.” Well we
                    got four or five members who showed up, a bunch of staffers whom I had invited
                    at the last minute, and the party was a bust. That was the beginning. It never
                    really got on track. I was out of synch with Christopher on human rights. He
                    also kept volunteering, and Les Gelb was pushing for a ceiling of $10 billion on
                    arms sales around the world. And I kept saying, “Don't do that. You've got the
                    Israelis, you've got NATO, you've got ANZUS, and you're just going to create
                    problems for yourself when the needs arise in the future.” Then, of course, the
                    needs did arise, and we did have problems, and I was right.</p>
                <p>Carter went to Saudi Arabia, and he fell in love with the Sheik and promised him
                    the latest F-5s, a fighter aircraft, and of course the Saudis were incapable of
                    flying or maintaining them, but that's what the Sheik asked for, and Carter said
                    yes. He came back and they introduced the legislation. I took some readings, and
                    got together with Gelb and said, “This is going to get killed. The Israeli lobby
                    will never tolerate this. They have to be one generation behind where the
                    Israelis are. That's the tradition, and that's the way its got to be, and if you
                    try anything else, you're going to lose, and in the process you'll generate a
                    lot of criticism of the Saudi government.” He said, “Let's go in and see Vance.”
                    I made this pitch, and Vance looked at me with an icy stare and he said, “You're
                    fighting the problem.” I said, “I don't think I understand what you mean Mr.
                    Secretary.” He said, “The President made a commitment to the head of another
                    state to produce these aircraft. Our job is to get it done.” And I said, “My job
                    isn't to get it done, my job is to come back and tell you, suggest that you tell
                    the President, that was a mistake, and there's a way around this. Offer F-4s,
                    not F-5s, and with a lot of training an F-5 is ten years down the road, and that
                    way you'll avoid this problem.” Well, Vance was outraged at my attitude, and so
                    they put it through, and it was rejected. And in the process our relationship
                    with Saudi Arabia went downhill, because of the Congressional criticism during
                    the ill-fated process. Doug Bennet and the Secretary were working very hard
                    against elitism. I was a symbol of the old Foreign Service elite attitude.</p>

                <p>JENKINS: Well, you know, I went to Bowling Green in Ohio, and I lived all over
                    the country, and I'll take my hat off to no one in terms of my being a
                    representative American.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: He's a hell of a lot more eastern establishment, no question about it.
                    Carter came in with this concept which Clinton had taken several steps further.
                    That we're going to look like the American people, and we're going to be
                    reflective, etc., and we're going to get rid of elitism. So I was out of
                    synch.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget the first week the new administration was in office. Carter
                    came around to the State Department. He visited all the departments, and he
                    stood up and made his little speech to about a thousand people in the Loy
                    Henderson auditorium. And among other things he said that we're going to end all
                    this elitism, we're going to have a real representative Foreign Service and
                    State Department, etc. And on the stage behind him he had assembled all the
                    Assistant Secretaries. Well, I was the Acting Assistant Secretary for H, so I
                    was there. We had a black woman who ran Passports and Consular Affairs, Barbara
                    Watson, who was out of town. So her deputy, a white male, was there. We had
                    another one, Patsy Mink, who did Science and Technology. She was out of town, so
                    her deputy was there, who was a white male. The net result of this was, there
                    were twelve senior staff in the State Department on the stage, and it was 100%
                    white males. So Carter makes this statement with Vance and Christopher on the
                    stage with him, and he ends, the first question in the front row a black man
                    stands up and said, “Mr. President, I'd like you to turn around, and look at the
                    senior staff in the State Department.” We sat there, and we all... He did turn,
                    and I knew then—they put in place a quota system, every bureau was going to have
                    at least one minority, and they created jobs to put people into it, Equal
                    Opportunity, quadrupled its staff. Pat Derian created the new office of Human
                    Rights. Pat is a sweet woman, married to a wonderful guy, but she had no more
                    background in foreign policy than the man in the moon. I was out of step. I
                    lasted about six or seven months.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>I went to the Senior Seminar, Chris Van Hollen let me in at the last minute. I
                    had been lecturing to the Senior Seminar for ten years, I was much too old. But
                    I had a great year, and then at the end of that I had two opportunities: one to
                    go over to CIA, Frank Carlucci was an old pal of mine, and he called me and
                    said, “I want you to come over and run Congressional Relations for the agency,”
                    which was a very interesting time to be doing it. And I was also offered a job
                    at Commerce as DAS for East-West Trade. And I thought, you know, I'm going to
                    get out of the Service, I'm fed up with this. I was supposed to be ambassador to
                    Romania, that was given to Rudy Aggrey. And then I was supposed to be ambassador
                    to East Berlin, and that went to Dave Bolen, both black officers, very fine
                    guys, but they weren't at my level, and they didn't have my experience in the
                    area. And Carter had frozen the executive pay raise, so I'd been sitting there
                    at the top of my grade for seven years with no pay increase. Inflation at that
                    point running at 18%, and I decided to hell with it.</p>
                <p>So I took the Commerce job knowing it would offer me greater opportunities, which
                    it did. I was there for one year, and Armco Steel Company hired me away, tripled
                    my salary, and I spent ten years as Washington Vice President for Armco, before
                    I retired there.</p>
                <p>In the Commerce job I had a wonderful time, I traveled around; led the delegation
                    to China that negotiated the first trade agreement; organized the meetings with
                    the U.S.-Soviet Trade Commission; and the Polish Trade Commission; took Juanita
                    Kreps to China, Bucharest, and Moscow. We did a lot, fighting with Richard Perle
                    all the time over the question of trade with the Soviet Union. I was pushing for
                    non-strategic trade as a way of undermining and creating consumerism. And Perle
                    was trying to conduct economic warfare, and he had his allies at the Defense
                    Department, and we didn't get very far. But it was an interesting time. Juanita
                    was heroic and stood up to Defense and others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Juanita Kreps was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: The Secretary of Commerce, and a splendid woman. But I left with no
                    regrets. I must say the style in which the Department of State used to muster
                    you out, and I gather it's somewhat but not a lot better now, there was no
                    ceremony. I mean this was 30 years I'd been in the Foreign Service, and I'd been
                    in senior jobs, DAS jobs, for ten years, the last ten years I was in the
                    Service. And my mustering out consisted of getting, in the mail, a plastic
                    plaque with the Department's seal on it. It was broken when received. That was
                    my retirement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've told the story, I don't think its apocryphal. I think
                        it's true, of one of our most distinguished ambassadors who had been in a
                        series of very difficult spots, and was going through the processing out,
                        and as he walked out the door, all of a sudden somebody came running after
                        him, “Mr. Ambassador, Mr. Ambassador,” and he thought, “Ah, this is it.” And
                        somebody said, “You forgot to turn in your badge.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>JENKINS: That's typical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, your satisfaction comes from what you've done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's not very good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: You know, I had 30 years in the most historically sensitive and
                    significant years in the history of our country. And during that time I had an
                    incredible array of experiences, and the last ten years in very responsible
                    policy level jobs. There wasn't anything I could have done that would have been
                    more satisfying, more fun, more challenging, and I cherish every moment of it. I
                    especially cherish my relationships with what I think is the finest band of
                    qualified, brilliant, dedicated men and women in this country. I think the
                    Foreign Service Officer Corps today remains the most competitive, the most
                    elite, the most competent, of any diplomatic service in the world, by far. And I
                    am absolutely as proud as punch for having been a part of it. And I wouldn't do
                    it any differently.</p>
