                <p>ROCKWOOD H. FOSTER</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 13, 1998</p>

                <p>[Note: This interview has not been edited by Mr. Foster]</p>
                <p>Q: This is an interview with Rockwood H. Foster. What do you go by?</p>
                <p>FOSTER: Adam. It's a nickname.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering. How did Adam come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: My grandfather Foster had mostly daughters and when I was born to one of
                    his two sons, he said, “This is my first Foster grandson,” (laughter) and Adam
                    became a nickname. It has been useful in the Foreign Service. Anyplace in the
                    world that a missionary had been to, they knew the name, but the name Rockwood
                    would have been very difficult, particularly in Japan.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, to try to get around that “R” and all that. I would like to start out at
                    the beginning. Could you tell me when and where you were born and something
                    about your family?</p>
                <p>FOSTER: All right, I was born in Boston, Massachusetts on May 7, 1923. So, as we
                    sit today, I have just completed three quarters of a century, a century which I
                    think is one of the most productive and creative that ever our country has seen
                    so far. I also feel we ain't seen nothin' [nothing] yet!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: There are two halves of the family. One is my mother's side and her
                    maiden name [and hence my middle name] was H-o-a-r, a very difficult name for a
                    girl to live with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>FOSTER: One of her ancestors was president of Harvard and he's thonly president
                    that doesn't have a house named after him. (Laughter)</p>
                <p>The man I was named for, Rockwood Hoar, my grandfather, was a congressman from
                    Massachusetts. My great-grandfather, George Frisby Hoar, was a Senator from
                    Massachusetts. So, my father won this beautiful girl called Francis Hoar. And
                    they were married at St. John's Church, right across the street from the White
                    House because of her father being a congressman and her grandfather being a
                    senator. This is a family that spent most of its life in public service.</p>
                <p>On the other side, my father, Reginald Foster, was a banker in London and in
                    Germany for the... I can't remember the name of the bank at the moment. I think
                    it was the Bankers Trust Company. I'm not quite sure. He looked at [the] Europe
                    [scene] in 1936 when we were living in London and said, “The time has come to go
                    home.” And he was right. I was then 13.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you educated? You were born in Boston. Could you
                        tala bit about your education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: I went to boarding school. It was called Brooks School and had been
                    started by Groton. [Brooks'] headmaster, Frank D. Ashburn, had been senior
                    prefect at Groton. I graduated from Brooks School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was essentially an elementary school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: No, I went to secondary school there. Remember, in 1936, when we came
                    back from England, I was 13 at that point. The time had come for me to go away
                    to school and off I went to Brooks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe a bit about the educational system and
                        the lifat Brooks School?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Life at Brooks School was pre-World War II life. Boston children mostly
                    went off to these private boarding schools. And I did, too, like everyone else.
                    It was the normal thing to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talk about “everyone else,” but you're talking about
                        peopl“born to the manor.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>FOSTER: Exactly, the Anglo-Saxon types particularly. Right. So, it was a pattern
                    of pre-World War II, which was totally changed as a result of World War II. To
                    some extent it is back, but it is still happening. Now, I will say this. Having
                    been to boarding school, I had no trouble in boot camp in the U. S. Navy. I knew
                    how to make my bed. I knew how to put clothes away and get [to] places on time.
                    So, the children of the overprivileged who'd gone to boarding school were well
                    trained for this. (Laughter) Children of the under privileged, whose mothers had
                    picked up their clothes and taken care of them, had a terribly difficult
                    time.</p>
                <p>Q: I know when I went to camp for four years during the war, I went in as an
                    enlisted man in the Air Force. It was no big deal. I knew how to avoid superiors
                    and to keep my head down.</p>
                <p>FOSTER: And you also learned to shave in the evening, not in the morning when
                    everybody else was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about education there? Were you particularly
                        interested iany particular subjects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Government. Now, they didn't use the phrase “Political Science” because
                    it wasn't considered a science. But, government. Aside from that, it was the
                    regular boarding school education: some science, some language, some Latin,
                    English, and so on. [Afterwards] I was admitted to Harvard College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Harvard from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: I went to Harvard in two [timeframes], pre-World War II and post- World
                    War II. I was a freshman in Harvard in 1941. I had asked Harvard to give me a
                    roommate from just as far away from Boston as possible, so that I would meet
                    somebody else. And the boy who was suggested to me and with whom I roomed
                    freshman year came from a town called Honolulu.</p>
                <p>And I remember coming back in 1941 to find him in tears, huddled around his
                    radio, saying, “They're bombing my house!” That was December 7, 1941. And the
                    world changed from then on. I should add that, fortunately, his parents were all
                    right, which he didn't learn for two weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you planning to continue in government studies at
                        Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Well, Harvard College, remember in those days, was set up to do a general
                    education. In order to get a job, you went to a job preparing school like the
                    Harvard Divinity School or the Harvard Business School, but as an undergraduate,
                    you were meant to get a general education in college. So I took all the general
                    courses that one takes. But, by 1942, with the war, I couldn't stay.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. Well, this was pretty much what was happening.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: To everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: I was in the Naval ROTC [Reserve Officer Training Course], so I
                    volunteered for the Naval Flying Air Corps Program. It was called V-6 and off I
                    went to learn how to fly. And I was sent to Amherst where I had my first flying
                    lessons, right near a place called Smith College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: (Laughs) And there I learned to fly a little tiny plane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a “Yellow Peril” - you know, the Navy's N3N-1 that
                        wabuilt in the 1920s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes, it was a “Yellow Peril!” (Laughter) You know somethinabout this one
                    I see!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: I was then sent down to the Midwest for [additional training]. They had a
                    field laid out like a carrier deck top and we learned how to land on a carrier.
                    And time went on and the war was drawing to a close and they called me up and
                    said, “We're throwing you out of the Air Corps Program, because we have a new
                    program.” And I said, “What's that?” And they said, “Well, in the old days, the
                    Navy radio chiefs, if the radio didn't work, they'd just take all the tubes out
                    and drop them over the side and put new tubes on and that took care of it. With
                    all of these new things like radar and so on, we can't repair things that way
                    anymore, so we're sending you to electronic training school.” And I said, “But
                    I'm studying government!” They said, “That's all right. You went to Harvard. You
                    can learn anything.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you studying electronics?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>FOSTER: Well, I wound up, which is important in a couple of intermediate places,
                    in the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC. I was put on a highly top
                    secret, at that time, project. So top secret, they couldn't even use the name.
                    It was called Loran. And every [fisherman has] one now. But in those days, it
                    was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a navigation system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Exactly, and you see, you couldn't fix that by throwing the tubes over
                    the side. And that's where I met the marvelous girl that I'm still married to
                    over 50 years later, who came [to] Smith College [from] Kansas City. So, you
                    see, I had a mixed marriage: Boston and Kansas City. But I can assure you my
                    children are bilingual. (Laughter) They can say either “tomato” or “tomahto,”
                    depending on where they are.</p>
                <p>I should mention my father [at this point, because he] was recruiteby Bill
                    Donovan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of the OSS [Office of Strategic Services].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Well, before. But, yes. And he was in OSS and died in 1945. He was in
                    charge of special operations in Europe and though he never [participated]
                    himself, he knew a great deal about it. As a young man, he graduated from
                    Harvard in 1911, he had been on one of the Hoover missions to Europe during that
                    period and had been in the Army. So he, again, had been connected with public
                    affairs. I should stop a moment and say I did not serve in CIA [Central
                    Intelligence Agency]. I'm a straightforward Foreign Service Officer. I know many
                    CIA people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this was one of the prime recruiting grounds for the
                        OSand the CIA, the “Eastern Establishment” schools.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the war ended in '45, did you get out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: I got out as an electronic technician and went back to Harvard. It was
                    '46 when I actually got out. I went back and I got my degree from Harvard in
                    1948.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were married at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>FOSTER: No, I was not. I was engaged. By that time, I was engaged to a Smith
                    College girl in 1947. She spent a year in Cambridge until I graduated. The world
                    was very different in those days. I remember being in the Harvard Yard at
                    Commencement in 1947, holding her hand and listening to the Secretary of State
                    address Harvard. His name was George Marshall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the announcement of the Marshall Plan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Of the Marshall Plan. So last year, fifty years later, we went back to
                    hear the Secretary of State, Madeline Albright, speak exactly fifty years, to
                    the day, later. She opened her remarks by saying, “My heels would not fit in
                    Marshall's boots.” Well, the place just collapsed [in applause]. This is off the
                    subject but we're very glad we went back. So I graduated from Harvard in '48,
                    married Margot in Kansas City, and went to work in a backwater at the State
                    Department as an “intern,” as it was called in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to go quickly to Harvard. Was it still the
                        generaeducation there in '46?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Quite totally different atmosphere. Everybody was in a hurry to graduate
                    and get on with their lives, having spent this time in the Armed Forces and I
                    was no different. I continued my studies and interest in Government and got my
                    major in Government and applied for an internship in the Department of
                    State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Because I had lived so much of my life in England overseas and
                    [international issues] was an interesting subject. If you think back to the
                    world in those days, foreign affairs was crucial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: And I was interested in this; and government, that was thplace to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you done any reading or preparation for the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Basically, no. Just a general course. They were recruiting at that time
                    and I'm sure there were people who had known my father. I'm talking about State
                    Department people who were interested in his son coming. I can't prove this, but
                    I suspect this.</p>

                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: It was an internship in the State Department. They were trying to
                    encourage people [to join]. Remember, [at that time], they still had civilian
                    employees as well as Foreign Service people. The Wriston program had not
                    happened yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so you entered under a Civil Service program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: [I was appointed as a clerk typist in September 1948 and assigned to the
                    Division of Organization and Budget [OMB] in the Office of Budget and Planning
                    [OBP] of the Administration Bureau. Remember, at that time, the Civil Service
                    consisted of so- called Clerical, Administrative, and Fiscal [CAF] grades and
                    the Professional grades. By August 1949, they transferred me to this backwater
                    where nothing happened. It was called the Division of Southeast Asian Affairs
                    [SEA] in the Far East Bureau [FE]. After being in SEA for a few months, in June
                    1950, I was accepted on the professional side of the Civil Service and given a
                    GS-7 ranking.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to get a handle on your dates. How long were you
                        in thDivision of Southeast Asian Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: From 1949, I'm guessing now, to 1956, when they came to me and said,
                    “You've got to go overseas,” because, you see, the world had exploded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. In '49, could you describe the Bureau or the
                        Desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: [All right. It is interesting that you ask, since the Far East Bureau was
                    reorganized shortly after I arrived. Of course, the question of where the Middle
                    East and the Far East bureaus met had been decided as the Burma-India border.
                    Burma was in the Bureau of Far East Affairs. India was in the Bureau of Middle
                    East Affairs. When I arrived, the Far East Bureau had a front office, and
                    divisions that handled Chinese and Northeast Asian, meaning Japan and Korea,
                    Affairs. Then there was the Division of Philippine Affairs and the Division of
                    Southeast Asian Affairs, where I was assigned. By November 1949, these units,
                    instead of being “divisions,” were called “offices.” There was still an Office
                    of Chinese Affairs and an Office of Northeast Asia, but the other two offices
                    were combined into the Office of Philippine and Southeast Asian Affairs
                    [PSA].]</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did [the Office of Philippine and] Southeast Asian

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>FOSTER: [PSA] consisted essentially of the former Dutch, French, anBritish
                    colonial areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '49 where did they put you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: They put me as the assistant to the [PSA acting director], a man called
                    William Sterling Byrd Lacey, who hired me, basically, to write a summary every
                    two weeks of things that went on in Southeast Asia. There wasn't enough to issue
                    this more than once every two weeks.</p>

                <p>FOSTER: Not when I first went in.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Burma had just become independent.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we had interests in Thailand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: We did.</p>
                <p>Q: And then you were moving into the problems of Indochina with the French.</p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes, but you see that the French surrender had not yet happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they were fighting the Viet Minh, weren't they, or had

                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Not yet. And Mao Zedong and Ho Chi Min had both been negotiating in the
                    background, I'm told, but working with the US. And we, because of the pressures
                    on the Hill, had nothing to do with it.</p>

                <p>FOSTER: Indonesia was rather peaceful at that point, nothing mucgoing on. It had
                    one hell of a lot of oil and a lot of Muslims.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did Indonesia win its war for independence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: I think it was [shortly after the war], before I got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So all these places were basically independent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Many of them were colonies. For instance, Singapore and Malaya were
                    colonies. Burma was independent. Thailand, obviously, was [never a colony].
                    Indonesia had just become independent. The Philippines were independent,
                    theoretically anyway [and had its own division in the Bureau when I joined].
                    Places like Japan and Korea were in [other offices within] the Far East
                    Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you finding as far as reports of these places?
                        Did whave embassies or consulates?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: We had an embassy in Burma, obviously. We had an embassy in Bangkok and
                    we had an embassy in Jakarta. The rest were consulates and consulate generals.
                    For instance, we had a consulate general in Chiang Mai, because it was on the
                    old Opium Road that went into China. Remember we had no relations with China at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>Q: When you arrived in '49, the Chinese Communists had just basically won their
                    war and I would imagine most of the time you would have been watching for the
                    fallout.</p>
                <p>FOSTER: The trouble was we had no reporting in China at all. So we were dependent
                    on the generosity of our allies, particularly the British, for information about
                    China. We were able to get some of our own through Chiang Mai, because it was on
                    the Opium Super Highway into South China. We could get some from Burma and
                    Thailand because of the Chinese presence up in the north. And I think we had an
                    extensive CIA operation. I guess it was still the OSS then, up in northern
                    Thailand and way up north of Burma.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it there was a feeling that whatever was happening

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that Chiang Mai was on the old Opium Trail.
                        Werdrugs at all of interest or was this a minor problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: That was a minor problem to us. What was important to us was the fact
                    that there were carriers going in and out of China from there with information.
                    Our job, essentially, was information gathering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Vietnam. Was this a matter of any concern of
                        ours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Well, we had in PSSA an officer in charge of Vietnam. A man whose name
                    was Sullivan, I think. He'd been vice consul in Hanoi and had been pulled back
                    to do this job. I'm not sure that name is right. But there was increasing
                    concern. Again, we were getting information from the French, sometimes not
                    accurate.</p>
                <p>Q: There apparently was a certain battle over Viet Nam where our natural
                    inclination was to say, “Let them be independent.” But then there was the
                    problem of the Communists. You know, do you want independent Communists. And
                    then the other one was, particularly in the first part in the early '50s, that
                    we weren't necessarily supporters of the French colonial effort. At the same
                    time, France was very important to us in Europe as part of the NATO [North
                    Atlantic Treaty Organization] thing. Were you feeling any of these tides?</p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes, because there was enormous tension between the Bureau of European
                    Affairs and the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs for precisely this reason. The
                    French Desk, particularly, did not want us to have anything to do with the
                    locals.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The locals being the Vietnamese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: That's right, both north and south. Let's say “the Indochinese.” But
                    those of us who worked there said, “Look, we're going to be involved. We'd
                    better get our own relationships here, fast. The French can't do this for us
                    anymore.” And I gather from Dayton that you had served there so you know exactly
                    what I'm talking about.</p>

                <p>FOSTER: In Saigon.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, did you feel that the arrival in '53 of John Foster Dulles and Walter
                    Robinson and the bureau of East Asians a change in attitude, a strongly
                    anti-Communist attitude or not?</p>
                <p>FOSTER: Now, when you speak o“anti-Communist,” are you referrinto Ho Chi Min? Is
                    that what you're talking about? The Viet Minh?</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, because Walter Robinson came as a proponent of a much tougher attitude
                    towards Communist China and I would think, by inference, towards Ho Chi Min. Did
                    you notice?</p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes. But it was not because the French wanted it, but because we felt
                    that the future of that area should not be in the hands of China, that [the
                    Indochinese] should have their own. That's the way I remember it. And Dulles,
                    remember, was related to his brother, who was deep into the intelligence
                    business. And Dulles was no dummy. There's no question about that. I think he,
                    by going with Robertson, became more sympathetic to the Far East point of view
                    than the EUR [European Bureau] point of view. That would be my suspicion but,
                    remember, I was very junior.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I understand that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: And the other thing, of course, that was going on was in thCongress as
                    they were attacking people for their Communist views.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling any of the heat around you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Around me, yes. I was too junior.</p>

                <p>FOSTER: The more senior people were scared to death of it. We were too junior,
                    really, to be afraid of it, but we saw what our seniors were worrying about. For
                    instance, Bill Lacey, William Byrd Lacey, who I worked for eventually was going
                    to go to Manila as the Minister. They refused to confirm him as Minister so he
                    just went as the Number Two to Manila. There, he invented something which is
                    used today. He invented something called DCM. And instead of saying, “Minister
                    sat down with someone,” he began to send messages saying, “DCM [deputy chief of
                    mission] met with so and so.” And is now today one of his legacies. That is an
                    obscure historical point that may amuse you. (Laughter)</p>
                <p>Q: You were there during the major development in Vietnam. That is, the
                    increasing French War with the Viet Min at the time, who were led by Ho Chi Min.
                    Were you getting more information? What was the feeling?</p>
                <p>FOSTER: Feeling towards the increasing tension, you mean?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean the perspective of your office. Was there any
                        sympathfor the anti-French movement or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Not really, no, because they were extreme, but [then the French were
                    extreme also]. I think this is where began what eventually wound up as something
                    called SEATO, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. It began because of the
                    feeling for [a] need for Southeast Asians to pull together, for the former
                    colonials to pull together into some kind of regional group.</p>
                <p>So, by '56, I was also in charge of SEATO. You see, in Burma, I started preparing
                    this report and then I was made assistant officer in charge of Burma. Terribly
                    elegant at my age. (Laughs)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now with Burma, were there any American interests
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Basically not. Some Americans liked rubies but that's about all that you
                    could say. And the Burmese were under a man called U Nu, who did very well,
                    indeed. There were a number of small [ethnic] groups, like the [Shan, Karen,]
                    and so on, but it was peaceful enough. And then, the decision was made to
                    [Wristonize the Foreign Service].</p>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>FOSTER: And I was so busy, I just [accepted the conversion to the new system and
                    became a Wriston FSO in November 1954]. And I was then Number Two in the section
                    of the office that handled Thailand and Malaya. So I was made officer in charge
                    of Malaya. My boss was an extraordinary man, now dead, whom, I think it's too
                    bad you couldn't have interviewed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who's that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: His name was Kenneth Perry Landon. He came to Thailand as a missionary
                    and his wife was pregnant, so when he went off Christianizing the Thais, she had
                    to sit in Bangkok waiting for the baby. She got bored and she wrote a book. Anna
                    Inerkin was her name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: He was an extraordinary man, knew a great deal about Thailand, but needed
                    somebody to deal with Malaya and Singapore, which was essentially what I did as
                    his assistant. I was still very young.</p>
                <p>Q: Oh, yes. I understand that. Was everything we were seeing in that area
                    (Malaya, Singapore, Burma etc.) sort of predicated on Communism and keeping the
                    Chinese out.</p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes. China was a threat. I think we all thought that, but we knew so
                    little about what was going on in China. I think we were sensitive to the fact
                    that one of China's big problems was keeping it as one nation instead of
                    Balkanizing like Europe. But we were [also concerned] about Chinese influence in
                    Southeast Asia particularly because of the economics of it. These were very rich
                    countries. Very rich. Thailand is very rich. Indonesia still. But a lot of
                    Chinese immigration to these places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we watching the overseas Chinese in these
                        places?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes, as best we could, but we didn't really have that much staff and we
                    had very few people who spoke the languages. I never spoke any of the languages.
                    You had people who spoke French, yes, and English, and Dutch, but not the
                    indigenous languages.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes, it had been going on for a long, long, long time. In Malaya. I'm
                    using “Malaya,” not “Malaysia,” because that's what they called it then.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: And Thailand was going through a very difficult period. Three towering
                    figures really held together by the Royal Family. But Ken Landon, having been a
                    missionary there, knowing so much about it, was able, I think, to understand
                    better than anybody else, how to guide our country in our relations with
                    [Thailand], which stayed pretty good at his hands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have any chance to travel in those
                        areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: No, never. Not until much later did I ever get there.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I would have thought it would have been quite a problem to be dealing
                    with these countries and not getting you out to sort of look around.</p>
                <p>FOSTER: They didn't have the funds or the time. They [had] other people there who
                    had been, like Ken Landon, so why waste what little money they had sending me?
                    And I was in the process of forming a family and so on and so forth so I would
                    like to have gone but I was so busy. You see, you'd empty the “In Box” and you'd
                    come back the next morning and it was all full again. It was an exciting time
                    because, as I say, having come to a backwater to have it explode. This has
                    happened three times in my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in that office you ended up with Burmese

                <p>FOSTER: Yes, Malaya, Singapore, and Thailand but my field was Malaya at that
                    point. Landon did the Thai business. Then came the Wriston Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were Wristonized, this amalgamate of the Foreign

                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: I don't know the exact date, but before then. It would have been [around
                    November] 1954. It was early in the program and I was just so busy, I just did
                    it and kept on. Then, Ken Landon decided he would retire and so I took over as
                    the [acting officer- in-charge of Thai and Malayan Affairs in mid-1955 with
                    responsibility for Thai, Malaya, Chinese, and SEATO. Oh, and (Laughs) what've

                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: All for it. As far as I knew we were all for it. Thquestion was how [to
                    finance the organization].</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, because it was sort of a peculiar thing. You know SEATO included, was it
                    Pakistan? but not India, and Australia and New Zealand and then also... I can't
                    think of it from the United States but not the Philippines.</p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes, I can't remember now. Originally, I think no but iwas originally
                    done more on mainland.</p>
                <p>Q: The SEATO headquarters were set up originally I believe in Bangkok. SEATO was
                    supposed to duplicate NATO.</p>
                <p>FOSTER: Or the Middle East.</p>

                    really was China.</p>

                <p>FOSTER: In 1956, they said, “You've got to go overseas. You've been here eight or
                    nine years.” So I said, “Where are you going to send me?” They said, “Well,
                    we're going to make you Consul General in Chiang Mai.” That had been all set up
                    and they changed the assignment at the last moment. They said they were sending
                    me to London. I said, “Why?” They said, “Well, the officer who handles Far
                    Eastern Affairs in the Embassy in London is an expert on China, and we need
                    somebody who knows about Southeast Asia. And we're getting an enormous amount of
                    information from British sources.” So, I headed for London, followed by a wife
                    and three and three quarters children, (Laughs) who followed me. I was given
                    three things to do: to find my office, set up my desk, find a house, find an
                    obstetrician. And I did all of it brilliantly, including getting the finest form
                    of native interpreter you can get: an old-fashioned British nanny. (Laughs)</p>

                <p>FOSTER: Very well, indeed. I had a permanent pass to the Foreign Office, for

                    was very close, indeed. And they were very glad of our interest. I think they
                    shared most of the information about China with us, let alone Malaya and
                    Burma.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Except for the fact that they'd been there so long. They didn't tell us
                    where and how they got their information, but they'd been there so long they
                    tended to know what the [Chinese] were doing. At least, that was my opinion at
                    the time. And they'd pull some interesting tricks on you in the Foreign Office.
                    Like you'd be sitting at the guy's desk and he'd get up and go out in the hall
                    and they were watching to see whether you'd go through his papers, which I
                    didn't, obviously. And who knows what they'd left there for me to see if I had
                    gone through. This was a period of very close relations.</p>

                    more help and so I began to help part time, particularly when we were forming
                    the Suez Canal Users Association. One of our enormous problems was creating an
                    organization whose initials didn't spell something dirty in somebody else's
                    language. (Laughter) Like, do you remember during World War II, they tried to
                    set up the Supreme Headquarters Italian Territory and they suddenly realized
                    they couldn't do that.</p>

                    that I didn't know anything about it.” They were ashamed because the Eden
                    government hadn't released this information very far down... We saw the British
                    government fall. We also saw Princess Margaret getting married, the Queen having
                    a baby, and the U-2 Summit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Paris, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: And I saw with my own eyes, Sputnik sailing through thskies from a
                    balcony in London. What a period in history!</p>
                <p>Q: Oh, yes. Well, we want to go back to the Suez time because I'm told there was
                    a period, that at least at the higher level of the British government, there
                    were orders from Eden basically cut off all communication with Americans.</p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes, that was true and that's why the British junior people were saying
                    they hadn't held out on me. They just didn't know either. He held it, not just
                    from us, but from his own people.</p>
                <p>Q: This was where Eisenhower said eventually, “We're not going to stand by...
                    This is a French, British, Israeli invasion of Egypt at that point and the
                    United States took a very firm stand against it.</p>

                <p>FOSTER: By the way, I was a junior officer in the Far East part of the Embassy.
                    There were junior officers in the Middle East part of the Embassy. One of them
                    was Dayton Mak. (Laughs) [London: April 1954-December 1956]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Who is working with us now and whom we've
                        interviewed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes. And I was brought in to give him a hand.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, to help. What were you picking up regarding the Far East besides China?
                    Were you getting pretty good reports from Burma, Malaya, and Singapore?</p>
                <p>FOSTER: What I was getting, probably most importantly, was the British desire in
                    that period, to strengthen and preserve and continue the idea of Commonwealth,
                    as distinct from Empire. The movement from Empire to Commonwealth. This was, I
                    found, all over the place, not just at the senior levels. They realized that
                    colonialism was going to be a thing of the past.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, this was the time when the British were really
                        pulling bacin many places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Economics were forcing it.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, economics, their garrisons, and their areas were being were being
                    reduced and they were getting ready to pull out of Africa essentially.</p>
                <p>FOSTER: Where were the colonies to go when they pulled out, yosee. This is the
                    point. That's why the concept of Commonwealth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the British government during
                        thi'56 to '60 period living in Britain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: It caused me to ask myself a question, not just about the government, but
                    in general, which I will ask you if you have an idea on this. This is a
                    relatively small group, population of people in Great Britain. I'm talking about
                    England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales. For centuries now, they've had the most
                    extraordinary percentage of genius. Whether you're talking about art, whether
                    your talking about music, whether you're talking about literature, this really
                    quite small percentage of people have constantly and are continuing even to this
                    day to produce and be enormously creative. That doesn't mean that the Germans
                    and the French and the Italians aren't, too, but their populations are so much
                    bigger.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>The question is, “Why?” What is it about Britain that continues even to this day?
                    The most important scientific discovery of this day was invented in a garage in
                    Britain. It's called DNA and the gene pool and all this. And my own answer to
                    this is (which answers your question about the British government) their high
                    toleration of eccentricity. As long as you don't scare the horses, you can do
                    practically anything you want. And [the] line between eccentricity and genius is
                    [terribly thin]. So, that's not the kind of answer you were looking for, but
                    it's the toleration of eccentricity and basically letting people do what they
                    think is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the social divisions in England, Great Britain
                        at that time? It all strikes me as when you read British literature, watch
                        British movies that there's this very much “Us and Them” thing. It doesn't
                        seem to be a very bridgeable gap. Was that apparent when you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes. This, of course, was changing, but if one remembers the meaning of
                    the word “cadet.” It means “third son.” What did the children of the British
                    aristocrats do?They went into the Church, they went into the Foreign Service,
                    and the Military, you see. And it had to do with education. I'm not talking
                    entirely about learning either, because many of those aristocrats are pretty
                    uneducated and stupid. However, there was a certain code of behavior, which I
                    think, with all the immigrants that were pouring in, caused these divisions. We
                    think we're coping with immigration. Imagine what the British, the Anglo-Saxons
                    have coped with regarding immigration, which caused these class distinctions.
                    I'm not sure I know anymore the definition or the meaning of the word “class,”
                    but that's what you're referring to.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. During this time, did you find in the Foreign Office that there was any
                    sort of change during this '56-'60 period of relations the Embassy and the
                    Foreign Office as far as sharing information?</p>
                <p>FOSTER: Not that I'm aware of, but I would have only known it in a very narrow
                    field. As you know, our ambassador was withdrawn and a new man was sent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: [Winthrop Aldrich. He'd been there since 1953.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were saying he didn't get along?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: He wasn't very popular. I remember the British saying tme, “He came to
                    England with a closed mind and an open fly.”</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chasing women and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes, so he was pulled out after Suez and John Whitney was sent to be
                    ambassador [in early 1957. The next year,] I went off on home leave. I'd been
                    there two years. And when I came back, I discovered I had a new job. Whitney had
                    lost his temper, which he very seldom did. He said, “This isn't fair. The
                    British have the job divided between the Queen and the Prime Minister. And I've
                    got to do both. So I want a young Foreign Service officer to handle my Prime
                    Minister life and I want a young politician to handle my [royal
                    responsibilities], you know, [protocol] at court and all of this kind of thing.
                    And I was that young Foreign Service officer. I came back to discover I'd been
                    moved to a new job called [staff aide] to the ambassador. And a young
                    politician, still a friend of mine, had been brought in to handle his [royal
                    responsibilities]. His name is James Symington. Jimmy Symington [arrived in
                    London in 1958]. You may know he lives around here. Both of us very young, new
                    babies and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Basically, everything that had to do with the Foreign Service side of his
                    job being with the Foreign Office particularly with the Prime Minister. I was
                    his private secretary for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Prime Minister, being during this '58 to '60
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Well, Eden was succeeded, you see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it Macmillan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: It was Macmillan, yes. I'm having a senior moment, at this point, I've
                    sort of forgotten. But, essentially, dealing with his private secretary. [As
                    staff aide, I also had the daily duty of screening the ambassador's cables after
                    hours. So the embassy cable room would] call up in the middle of the night and
                    say, “There's an eyes only message for the ambassador.” They didn't wake him.
                    They'd wake me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, how nice! (Laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>FOSTER: And, I remember one night there was a message from the White House asking
                    him to present America's condolences on the death of the Prime Minister of South
                    Africa; and I could send a message back that night to the White House saying, “I
                    regret I cannot follow instructions, because I am not accredited to the Queen of
                    South Africa.” (Laughter) Within three hours, there was one saying, “London's
                    absolutely right and I'm going to do it.” And, you see, the White House staff
                    didn't understand [that when South Africa declared itself a republic and left
                    the British Commonwealth in May 1961, the Queen of England was no longer Queen
                    of South Africa.]. (Laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: This is an incident just for the fun of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your ambassador, John Whitney, operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: He took the trouble to read just as much as he could. He took the trouble
                    to ask his staff. He took the trouble to ask the British to explain things to
                    him. He was an excellent man and a very pleasant person, too. He had an enormous
                    amount of money, which was very hard to deal with, because he never carried any
                    money in his pocket at all. So you'd get in a taxi with him and you'd have to
                    pay for it. He always paid you back though. It's just habit on his part. He was
                    a brilliant collector. His collection of art work in the Embassy was just
                    extraordinary.</p>
                <p>We were invited to his parties, not because we were what we were, but because he
                    needed help [with the guests]. For instance, my wife and I would arrive at the
                    party and I'd [introduce myself around], “I'm Adam Foster. How do you do?” We'd
                    [separately] work our way [through the guests] and eventually we'd meet in the
                    middle and I could ask how the baby was coming along and so forth. One day we
                    were doing this in the middle of his house and this Brit propelled himself off
                    the wall, came over and said, “My name is so and so,” and turned absolutely
                    purple with embarrassment. He said, “We've been watching and we thought it was
                    such a good idea, but I thought I'd try it on you first.” (Laughter) And what we
                    discovered is if you say, “I'm Adam Foster,” the British were afraid somebody
                    would say, “So what!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Nobody ever does but they are really very shy. And the change in the
                    atmosphere when Whitney came was unbelievable and everything happened then. The
                    first US president in office ever to visit Britain came to visit.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Eisenhower.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes. And we, the staff, didn't know how long it was going to take to get
                    from Heathrow in to thAmbassador's house. It took five hours! Everyone in
                    Britain turned out on the streets. They loved Ike. And he wasn't going to drive
                    right [past] them, so he was waving and all. It was very moving. We did,
                    however, do something very shaky, diplomatically. Eisenhower wanted to play golf
                    at St. Andrews. [Because] they didn't allow golf carts at St. Andrews, [none
                    were available,] so we imported a golf cart through the diplomatic pouch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Eisenhower, having suffered several heart attacks,
                        needeit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: That's right, but we brought it in through the diplomatic pouch. The
                    British knew it and they didn't pay attention to it. The first hole of St.
                    Andrew's, it took him ten strokes to get the ball on the green. He was just
                    surrounded by British watching him; and when he finally got it on the green they
                    all clapped. (Laughter) It was just great! Again, I've gathered these moments
                    which you like recorded, and they're just marvelous!</p>
                <p>I would say this, that Jimmy Symington was handling the presentations at court
                    and all that kind of thing. One of those presentations, that they'd always
                    present the staff, and the ambassador presented this one guy whose name will be
                    nameless. Prince Philip said, “And what so you do” and the guy said, “I'm the
                    CIA.” Philip said, “You weren't meant to say that,” and moved on. (Laughter)
                    Although, I'm sure they knew it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, we declare in a place such as Britain. Well, in

                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: They came to me and said, “It's time for you to go home. You've been here
                    for almost five years.” And I said, “What are you going to do with me?” And they
                    said, “We're going to make you an obstetrician.” And I said, “What!?” And they
                    said, “Yes, every part of the world, except this hemisphere, has had new nations
                    being born, and the British colonies in the Caribbean have announced that they
                    wish to become independent, and we're sending you home to handle the
                    obstetrics.” And I said, “All right, but not the pediatrics.” And they said,
                    “Fair enough.” So I was sent home to Washington, and took over the West Indian
                    Affairs [desk in August 1960].</p>

                <p>FOSTER: And, I went to work. [Fortunately,] one of my friends who had been in the
                    Prime Minister's Office was sent here as the British colonial attach�, the last
                    one (I don't think they have [this title] anymore) to work with me on this. We
                    decided (and eventually both governments agreed) that the best thing would be to
                    have one nation so that Jamaica, Trinidad, British Honduras, and British Guyana
                    would all be on nation, a “United States of the West Indies.” And, we went to
                    work. And then, Stuart, the world exploded on me again. Remember, this was now
                    the third time this had happened. Once in Diem Bien Phu, once in Suez, and [now]
                    we went into the Bay of Pigs. I'm not sure it's my fault, but it seems to happen
                    to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that the Bay of Pigs would not have
                        beeyour baby.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: It wasn't my baby but, the Jamaicans had excellent intelligence into Cuba
                    and I remember Norman Manly, who was then the Prime Minister of Jamaica visiting
                    Washington and stepping off the plane here at the airport, shaking my hand and
                    saying, “Adam, I'm glad to see you. What the hell are you guys doing in Cuba?!”
                    And I looked at him and I said, “Mr. Prime Minister, I think you'd better ask
                    the President that this afternoon,” which he did. But, from this comes, I think,
                    another interesting story. When the first ambassador in Jamaica arrived here to
                    present his credentials, and I'm having a senior moment. I don't even remember
                    his name at the moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's all right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: He called me up in despair and said, “Adam, I've got a real problem.” And
                    I said, “What is it?” And he said, “They've scheduled me on Friday to present my
                    credentials and I'm an Orthodox Jew. I shouldn't do that. Can you help me?” And
                    I said, “Let me make a phone call.” So I called the White House and I said, “You
                    idiots! What do you mean scheduling an Orthodox Jew on Friday?!” And they said,
                    “What! From Jamaica?!” And, of course, Kennedy cared terribly about Jamaica. He
                    was reading Doctor No and this was something he was really looking forward to.
                    So they changed it to Monday. I called back.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>And in we went to the Oval Office in the White House on Monday morning. And
                    Sunday night, Kennedy had announced over the radio and television that we'd
                    stopped the Russian ships and he asked for every nation in the world and
                    everybody to support the US in this action. And in we walked into the Oval
                    Office at ten the next morning. Kennedy obviously hadn't been asleep all night,
                    tired but thrilled, because of Doctor No and all his bedside reading, to [greet]
                    the first Jamaican ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, this is a story by Ian Fleming. Sort of a history
                        story.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Fleming, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this one was based in Jamaica.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: This was Kennedy's bedside reading. So we came in and we went through the
                    ritual with this worn out, tired president and when we got all done, the
                    Ambassador said to him, “Mr. Kennedy, Mr. President, I heard you last night on
                    the television and I want to tell you that Jamaica supports the United States!”
                    And I thought Kennedy was going to burst into tears. It was the first he'd
                    heard.</p>
                <p>And as we left and we drove back in the limousine I knew something that Kennedy
                    didn't know and I looked at him and I said, “ That was a splendid thing you just
                    did there,” and he was so smart. He knew I knew. And what I knew was that in
                    those days there was no cable to Jamaica and all communications shut down at
                    sunset and I knew he had no instructions. (Laughter) And he knew I knew. He
                    looked at me and he said, “They can fire me if they want. “The next day he got
                    obviously a [cablegram] saying, “Absolutely right.” So, end of story, but this
                    was an extraordinary period.</p>
                <p>Q: The fact is that all these disparate little pieces of land from Jamaica down
                    to British Guyana all became independent but were we trying to do anything at
                    early times to show the advantage of joining together.</p>
                <p>FOSTER: We talked their ears off about this and we discovered the one reason they
                    really didn't want it was immigration. The big islands didn't want emigration
                    from the little islands, but they all wanted immigration into the US, oh yes,
                    but not among each other. That, to me, I think was the main reason why, for
                    instance, Jamaica voted it down. They had a [popular] vote on the subject and
                    they voted it down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have also thought, political aspirations being
                        what theare, all the people in a particular area wanted to be
                        impressed...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>FOSTER: And they all wanted to have their own Embassy in Washington and an
                    Embassy at the United Nations and all the rest of that was there, too. It made
                    very good sense economically because Trinidad has petroleum, Jamaica has bauxite
                    and so on but they wouldn't do it. So now each of them is a separate country. I
                    went to the Independence Ceremony and our representative was Jacques Whitney.
                    And you see, really by that time the reason I had been put there was because I
                    knew something about British colonialism and, again, the move towards the
                    Commonwealth. So, there is no queen in Jamaica. Her name is Elizabeth in London,
                    but she is Queen in Jamaica and the Embassy here in town is Her Jamaican
                    Majesty's Embassy. Totally confusing to anybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely. How about Trinidad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Same way. No. Trinidad decided to become a republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Guyana?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: And Guyana did, too. Most of them did, but Jamaica decided to stay a
                    monarchy. [With independence in the Caribbean], our work in the State Department
                    [multiplied] because of all the treaties we had with Britain that go back for
                    centuries. These things all flowed to these islands from Britain automatically,
                    but once they became independent, they had to sign their own. And the legal
                    people just had a terrible problem finding every damn [treaty or agreement] that
                    we had with the British, and getting each one of these countries to [recommit
                    to] it, which they did. It was a very fascinating and busy period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. And were we concerned with the spread of Castro
                        at thatime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: We were very concerned about it. Each of these countries had had some
                    experience with the unpleasant past and they knew a great deal about what was
                    happening in Cuba. The intelligence in the British was right on top of
                    everything. Many Jamaicans lived there, you see, and had been treated badly by
                    the government there, Castro particularly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did this from 1960 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>FOSTER: I did this from 1960 until 1963. [From 1962 I was the acting
                    officer-in-charge of Caribbean Affairs.] And the time had come for me to go
                    overseas and my children were now approaching [their] teenage [years] and they
                    had made it clear to me that they really were not that interested in Anglo-Saxon
                    [boarding schools]. [At that time], my grandmother and my mother both died one
                    right after the other, both [had been] widows, and I was the oldest son.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: And I had two younger brothers who were just beginning life and I finally
                    was ready to step down in the Foreign Service. [The Department] didn't really
                    know what to do with me. [It wasn't] very interested, I don't think, [in] the
                    British colonial thing. [That] was not that important to them anymore and so I
                    [took leave of the Department and] worked privately for several years. Then I
                    got appointed to be a colonial official in the only colony we had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what it was and how it came about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Well. You know what the colony was. The District of Columbia. [In
                    November 1967], the White House [replaced the commissioner form of government
                    and] decided to appoint 10 people to run this colony: one of them to act as the
                    executive branch, and one of them to act as the legislative branch. The man
                    appointed to act as the executive branch was Walter Washington, and nine of us,
                    carefully selected by the White House [were to be the legislative branch. Among
                    this group] there were five Republicans and four Democrats, five men and four
                    women, and five blacks and four whites. I represented the ultimate minority. I
                    was male in a city that was largely female; I was Republican in a city that was
                    largely Democrat; and I was Anglo-Saxon in a city that had very few of them
                    then. So I represented a certain ilk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you doing that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: I did that for three years. This was not Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to capture some of the atmospherics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: The reason they did this was because I knew about colonialism or British
                    type colonialism. Then, the fourth and final explosion of my life occurred. It
                    was called Home Rule. [Legislation offering self-government to the citizens of
                    the District passed Congress in 1973, during the Ford administration. On May 7,
                    1974, DC voters approved a Home Rule Charter in a special election].</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time before Home Rule, what was your
                        impression oWalter Washington? How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Walter Washington belonged to the aristocracy. We were talking earlier
                    about class. In those days, and I suspect today still, there was an enormous
                    spread in the African-American community. He was clearly upper class and a very
                    fine man.</p>
                <p>The only instructions we were given by the [Johnson] White House was “to act as
                    if you were elected,” whatever the hell that means. So, [Washington] took over
                    the administration of the city and we looked at each other and said, “What do
                    legislators do?” And the answer is, “They form committees.” So we formed
                    committees and I was in charge of three of them. One was a committee on foreign
                    affairs, because there are so many people from other countries who live [in the
                    District of Columbia]. Second, was a committee on the environment, [an issue]
                    which was just coming up. Lyndon Johnson had said that, making the Potomac
                    swimmable and so on, [was a goal we should aim for]. And the other was a
                    business one, because of [me] being an Anglo-Saxon. We formed these
                    committees.</p>
                <p>Then one evening somebody from the State Department came to me quietly and said,
                    “We've got a real problem. Can you help us?” And I said, “Like what?” This was
                    the period when young Chinese acrobats and Ping-Pong players were coming here
                    and they said, “We're not allowed to meet their plane at the airport and we
                    think this is a mistake. These are unusual young people and shouldn't be
                    snubbed. Could you arrange to have a “City Committee” formed that would go and
                    meet them and welcome them? Most of them don't speak English and they won't
                    know, but at least they'll know they were officially met.”</p>
                <p>And so I helped form a Mayor's Committee on International Visitors. For a couple
                    of years we did this. One day we got a telegram from what was then called
                    Peking, saying, “If you can get 23 people to Peking at your expense, we will
                    take care of two weeks of travel anywhere in China. You've been so nice to our
                    young people.” So we went back to the Department and got briefed and they said,
                    “By all means, do it. But don't ask to see anything that has anything to so with
                    classified warfare or armies.”</p>
                <p>This was in [the early 1970s] and when this came a balloon exploded because all
                    our spouses said, “Oh, you can't go without me!” So we finally sent a telegram
                    back saying, “What about 40?” And the answer came back, “No.” And we didn't
                    discover until we got there why. We were all put in a Shanghai bus that holds
                    25. So there were 23 of us, [and] a male and a female [tour guide]. 40 was just
                    really [too much for the Chinese vehicles and escort service. So we basically
                    toured] in containers going all over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say Walter Washington came from aristocracy. How did

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>FOSTER: Enormous charm. He was a good man. He was efficient. He wasn't elected so
                    he could decide what was right and just do it. And the only people that had to
                    worry about it was the White House, who was delighted to have him deal with
                    [these issues].</p>
                <p>Q: Did you see any of the problems that later became endemic to Washington? That
                    was the proliferation of the government's City Service, and awful lot of both
                    corruption and just plain inefficiency. Was this a problem then?</p>
                <p>FOSTER: Not in my day. Again, because we could decide and just do it without
                    worrying about politics, as long as the White House backed you. They were glad
                    to have us, if you'd just do what you thought was right. You could fire people,
                    start or stop organizations. It wasn't until Home Rule that this became... You
                    see, Marion Barry was elected after Home Rule. He never was appointed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Home Rule came, that ended your job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes, and then, having been aware of colonialism around the world, I just
                    quietly packed my bags and went home, and didn't try and give anybody any
                    advice. Of course, they never asked me anyway. And then watch as this thing
                    began to develop. By that time I'd left the Foreign Service, so I was able to go
                    to Republican conventions [1988 as an alternate delegate] and be a Republican,
                    which was [another] total minority. I am of the opinion today that this is was
                    the city needs, a two party system. [The competition would] help [the]
                    Democrats. If you've got a Democrat thinking, “You're doing something stupid,”
                    [or] another Democrat [saying], “Hey, don't do that,” they'll win, you see.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. I want to go back to one other thing, back to your last job in the State
                    Department. When the former British colonies became independent, how well did
                    your office fit in to ARA? Basically ARA was a Latin American, Hispanic entity,
                    and then all of a sudden you have these English speaking people who want to
                    become part of the ARA club. How did this work?</p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes. I wasn't there. I'd stepped down at that point. Once this was done,
                    I'd said I didn't want to do the pediatrics. So that I really can't answer this.
                    I don't know. This could be a question to ask even today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because it does not seem like a very good fit. You
                        havBritish Honduras as part of your [Hispanic bureau]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Yes, and Belize.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Belize.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Have you been there?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I haven't .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Extraordinary. You see, I've been to all of them. I used to go in the
                    winter. It was a good time to visit my posts. And I think the other thing which
                    is important to record here is that there had been many year before an agreement
                    with the British called “Destroyers for Bases.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: Everybody knows about the destroyers but nobody knows of what [became of
                    the islands we acquired for the destroyers. They were] all in the Caribbean and
                    became the basis for the Atlantic Missile Range, so we had to deal with all of
                    that, too. It was quite interesting and I believe that today's airport in
                    Bermuda actually was on of those bases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think we might stop at this point, don't you? This
                        iexcellent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FOSTER: I think so. Q: Well, I want to thank you.</p>
                <p>FOSTER: I'm sorry to have talked so much, for so long.</p>
