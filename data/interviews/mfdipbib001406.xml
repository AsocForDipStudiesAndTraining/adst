                <p>[Note: This interview has not been edited by Mr. McGaffey]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is September the 8th, 1995. This is an interview
                        with David C. McGaffey. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. To begin with, can you
                        tell me when and where you were born and something about your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: I was born in 1941 in Michigan. My father was an attorney, my mother
                    was a psychologist. I was born on a farm and raised much of my early life on a
                    farm then moved to the bright lights and big city of Detroit, I thought it was a
                    city at the time. I left there immediately after I got my degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back a bit. Where did you go to high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: A variety of places. I started in a one room schoolhouse in rural
                    Michigan and then moved to a Catholic high school in Detroit. I then moved
                    almost immediately to a boarding school in Windsor, Assumption College High
                    School, where I went through the Canadian system through the 13th grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the high school were you getting much in the way of
                        international affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: No except that because it was in Canada, it was already slightly
                    international. A number of my friends were “Canadien” and others were Canadians
                    and I learned about something of that. A close friend was Mexican and with him I
                    spent one summer in Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to college where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: I did my undergraduate work at the University of Detroit.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Multiple fields in engineering, math, literature and psychology were my
                    majors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always try to probe any connection or knowledge of the
                        Foreign Service. Did you get anything of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: None at all. I was not particularly consciously aware of the Foreign
                    Service or of international affairs. I read a lot of books and seen some movies
                    and knew that there were ambassadors and that they had secretaries. To the
                    extent that I had knowledge of the rest of the world outside of Mexico and
                    Canada, it was through the Catholic church and Caritas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Caritas being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: The Catholic relief organization which I raised money for, helped
                    promote.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from college then you went on to what? What
                        did you do then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: I was looking for a Ph.D. in folklore and needed some way of financing
                    some field research. A young John Kennedy had started talking about something
                    called the Peace Corps and so I consulted with my professors and they said, “It
                    sounds like a great idea. Join the Peace Corps, take a tape recorder, do your
                    research and come back. You can write you dissertation, we'll give you a degree
                    and you can teach right here. We've got a whole new department starting.” I had
                    my whole life planned out. So I and my new bride joined Peace Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: 1964. We had applied for Chile. Through the Catholic church I knew
                    quite a bit about things that were happening in Chile and, besides, I loved the
                    ocean. The Peace Corps looked at my application and said here is somebody who
                    likes mountains and called me up and said “How would you like to go to
                    Afghanistan?” The only thing I knew about Afghanistan was that Marco Polo had
                    gone through it on his way to China, so I could place it in terms of China and
                    Europe and that was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You and your wife went to Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you and what did you do there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: We were in town of Farah. It is a provincial capital and an oasis in
                    the center of the desert of death in the southwest corner squeezed between Iran
                    and Pakistan, Baluchistan. We were the first foreigners who had ever come to
                    Farah to live. We were teachers in the sense of rabbi. The Peace Corps had one
                    definition of what we were supposed to do and we did that plus a lot of other
                    things: set up a science lab, opened the first high school for girls, dug wells
                    and taught carpentry. Mostly we were being Americans in a place that didn't
                    quite believe in those mythological beings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the Peace Corps experience is an important one so
                        I don't want to just let go of it. Here is an area which as you say,
                        particularly at that time, is practically untouched by the outside and
                        probably, I assume, intensely Islamic religious and all, how did you relate
                        to the mullahs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: We were obviously objects of notoriety from the moment we arrived to
                    everyone including the mullahs. I learned a great deal about Islam and taught
                    them a good deal about the evangel, the Bible, and about Christianity. About all
                    that they knew was that the Koranic Sharia said that Christianity was holy, it
                    was part of the direct revelation, and that's all they knew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you communicate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: In Farsi, in Persian. I was very poor at the other languages but I
                    became fluent in Persian. That was the trade language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you helped set up a girls high school. I would
                        have thought this would have run counter to much of what was going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: No. As a matter of fact, it was very much what was going on. This was
                    1964. Afghanistan was very much a part of the exploration of limits and deciding
                    what was new. They were trying to establish a central government for the first
                    time but never quite succeeded. They did things like provided money for schools
                    in all of the towns, built roads out, sent Peace Corps. So I was part of a
                    modernist conspiracy that was myself, the principal of the high school, the
                    governor, the chief of police, and the young doctor who was the first doctor
                    ever in town, all trying to refocus the minds of the people in Farah.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would expect in that society it would have been very
                        helpful to have been married, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: The only previous person from the Peace Corps was a young man who had
                    been sent down by himself and was installed in a hotel room. He came very close
                    to having a nervous breakdown because the people were so hospitable, and so
                    concerned for him, that they would sit in his hotel room for 18 hours a day just
                    to keep him company and he never had any privacy. He reported that it was an
                    unlivable town. So, yes, having a wife meant that we could have privacy and so
                    it was very important. Elizabeth was also a teacher, which meant that she was
                    ambisextrous. She was welcomed in both the male areas and the female areas. I
                    was only welcomed in the male areas, except for a very few exceptions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: For about two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the embassy or any feel for
                        the embassy at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Elizabeth and I were the most remote of the Peace Corps volunteers so
                    we were somewhat objects of notoriety among the Americans as well. Every time we
                    went up to Kabul we got dinner invitations and invitations to call on people at
                    the embassy. Arch Blood was the DCM there and impressed me out of my mind with
                    his sophistication and his awareness of things. But with that and two other
                    exceptions, I was not terribly impressed by the people in the embassy. Nobody
                    there with the exception of a man who I learned was the station chief, spoke the
                    language to anything like my capacity and my capacity was certainly limited.
                    None of them left the capital. All of them felt that talking to the small inner
                    circle of what we called the prop jet set, gave them an insight to what was
                    happening in Afghanistan, and they were wrong. I was very upset to find out that
                    the only people who seemed interested in what was going on in Afghanistan were
                    from the station rather than from the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When we're talking about the station, we're talking about
                        the CIA. Were you under sort of strict injunction to stay as far away as you
                        could from the CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Yes, certainly on any official basis but not on a personal basis. These
                    people did not identify themselves as “Hello, I'm from the CIA and I want you to
                    come to dinner.” They said “Hello, I'm Joe Blow and won't you come to dinner.” I
                    only found out about this later. When I went to Arch Blood to complain about
                    this, when I did find out about it, he said “All right, if you think you can do
                    better why don't you join the Foreign Service.” I said “How does one do that?”
                    He told me, so Elizabeth and I took the examination and we both passed. She got
                    a couple of points higher than I did. I got a lovely letter congratulating me on
                    the exam and welcoming me and telling me about the possibilities for the orals.
                    She got a letter which I wish we had saved but we didn't, which said “We note
                    with interest that you have taken the Foreign Service exam but also that your
                    husband took and passed the Foreign Service exam. Since we do not accept married
                    ladies in the Foreign Service, we assume that you took it only out of
                    interest.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a different world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: It was a different world. Anyway, I still had not made up my mind but
                    they had the traveling road show in those days and a team came to Teheran. Again
                    Arch Blood persuaded me to spend my money and I flew to Teheran and took the
                    oral. I met a real dragon lady, the ambassador's wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mrs. MacArthur?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: It was MacArthur, yes. After the exam I was asked to go and sit
                    outside. I was sitting there trying to figure out what they were making of me
                    and she walked through the hall then stopped and came back and took off my head
                    because I had not stood up when she entered the hall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure if she is deceased now but she was one of
                        three or four ladies who were renowned as the dragons in the Foreign
                        Service. Her father was at one point the vice president of the United
                        States, Alben Barkley. This is just an aside.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: I knew that and I knew of her later. My wife and I were on the drafting
                    team writing the Foreign Service policy on wives, the dreaded A seven. One of
                    the things that a friend of mine who was working for that ambassador later
                    reported was that she personally got 42 copies of A seven mailed to her
                    anonymously. I had just worked for another one of the dragon ladies in
                    Manila.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Anyway, they told me that I passed and they welcomed me into the Foreign Service.
                    I spent long hours talking about this with my wife and writing letters to my
                    academic mentors who kept telling me about this job that was waiting for me in
                    Ohio. We came back to the States still undecided. REA Express lost two
                    footlockers that contained all of my notes and recording and artifacts and I
                    felt a great sense of relief. I realized then that I wanted to join the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have all of those folklore stories hanging
                        around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Although Farah was fascinating for that. The storytellers would come in
                    and sit in the market and tell stories that I had successfully traced from the
                    1837 publication of The Little Yellow Book in London which had been shipped out
                    to the British in India. Picture this Victorian poppy reading to his children
                    and behind every child there was an ayah, a nanny, who would listen and go back
                    to her children and tell the stories. It was picked up and moved from Hindustani
                    through four different languages picking up elements of their culture.</p>

                <p>McGAFFEY: Yes, Lange.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How fascinating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: It was fascinating. It was a good dissertation topic and I had
                    documented the transmission but having lost it all, I then joined the Foreign
                    Service.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: September of '67 was when I was sworn in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you went to an A 100 course. Because you got
                        involved later in training, in the first place could you describe sort of
                        your colleagues who came in at that time and then a bit about how it was
                        done?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: It was the beginning of the major change in the Foreign Service. It was
                    a very mixed A 100 group. There was one fellow who was very proud that he had
                    never gone to college. There was a group of three people who were still working
                    on their dissertations and they were expecting their Ph.D.s. There were a number
                    of people with army experience including Vietnam experience and some of the
                    traditional eastern establishment, good school and family history. There was
                    also a very clear expectation that the world was different and the world was
                    changing, and that the traditional idea of the striped pants was not going to
                    happen. Almost all were married and that may have been because it was well known
                    that any bachelors who entered the Foreign Service were shipped off to CORDS in
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>One of the first things that happened was we received a formal invitation from
                    the Junior Diplomats for the eighth floor fourth of July black tie reception.
                    People were kind of looking at it and so I put up a little notice on the
                    bulletin board saying that I unfortunately have left my black tie at the
                    cleaners. If there is anybody else in that state and would like to spend fourth
                    of July at my place, bring your own dish. We got about two thirds of the class.
                    Because REA had lost our things I asked them to bring their own dinners and
                    leave the pots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think of the training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: A 100 at that time was almost totally an orientation course, not a
                    training. There were some people who told us war stories which were largely
                    irrelevant about the way diplomacy and the Foreign Service used to be in the
                    good old days. There were some very useful things about what is a telegram and
                    how it is made up, what is the organization of the State Department, who does
                    budgeting and how does that affect you. But it was a bureaucratic orientation
                    more than anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mentioning that Vietnam was looming its ugly head
                        or something. How did the assignments in your class work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: The dominant thing in my class was language and everybody was explained
                    that the State Department was cutting back because of congressional budget
                    cutting. Remember back in the good old days when that meant that they didn't
                    give us any more money? They could only afford to give language training to
                    people who didn't have a language. I had come in with a three/four in Farsi,
                    Roger Harrison had a three/four in German, and so on, and so on. All of us who
                    had language were then sent to language speaking posts, or at least what the
                    State Department considered English language posts. Anybody who came in without
                    a language was assigned to a hard language post so that they could get training
                    which meant, among other things, that a group of us who came in with language
                    got about a year's head start in the Foreign Service because the others were in
                    one to two year language assignments including Vietnamese for the bachelors.
                    Every bachelor was assigned to CORDS.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Extremely limited. The group was not a group of hawks. Many of them had
                    Peace Corps experience, many of them said the reason that they joined the
                    Foreign Service was we had been screwing up so long, it was time somebody came
                    in who could figure out how to do something without going to war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: To Manila in the Philippines. The president of the Philippines was
                    Ferdinand Marcos, elected and subject to normal electoral things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was from when to when you were in Manila?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: From '67 to '69. The place was something of a shambles with private
                    gangs and shootings on a daily basis. People were feeling as if they lived on
                    Capitol Hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about the crime problem in Washington D.C. at that
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: While I was there, professionally it was a wonderful job. This was the
                    year that congress abolished the old immigration law that assigned numbers on
                    the basis of previous immigration and there was what they called the triangle in
                    Asia, the Asia Pacific triangle, which was limited to 100 immigrant visas a
                    year. They abolished it and went by a date system which meant that Manila had a
                    backlog of some 45,000 approved petitions for immigrant visas. They had
                    drastically expanded the consular section and I and four others went out there
                    to join the three that were there. While I was there in the two years it was
                    expanded to 15 and I found myself chief of a section supervising seven FSOs and
                    about 20 Filipinos. Almost immediately I was given real responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about the type of work you were doing and
                        maybe some examples?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: The principal focus and the requirement was to process people for
                    immigrant visas. The backlog was huge of people who had family, friends,
                    relatives, jobs in the States and had applied and been approved but were waiting
                    for numbers. Our job was just to get as many through the gate as possible and
                    weed out those who had what was necessary and what not. One section was just
                    interviewing and processing, and going through the paperwork setting up
                    processes to get the paperwork out of the inefficient Philippine system to
                    assist them. I was in charge of that section which kept expanding until one day
                    when I was called into the ambassador's office. The consul general was there and
                    some people from the FBI and the head of the regional INS office were there.
                    They said they had some questions to ask me and the ambassador said “You don't
                    have the legal obligation to answer these questions at this point but I would
                    appreciate it if you would.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador by the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: We had four ambassadors in the two years. I believe this was the former
                    general, the youngest general, I can't remember his name. He was there just for
                    a short time and then was replaced by Soapy Williams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was also ambassador to South Africa. We can add
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: I had no idea what was going on but I answered the questions. It turned
                    out that a plane load of people had arrived on a charter flight from the
                    Philippines to Miami and had gotten off clutching their little yellow envelopes
                    which when they tore the ribbons and opened, they found full of empty blank
                    paper. Each of them said they had been interviewed by vice consul David C.
                    McGaffey, paid him the $500, and had gotten their visas from him. They were
                    interviewing me to find out what exactly this was all about. It turned out that
                    a representative of a veterans organization had been given office space in the
                    consulate. He had scheduled these interviews during the lunch hour and would
                    walk in and borrow my nameplate. He had issued some 5,000 immigrant visas which
                    were supposed to include transportation but one group of people were impatient
                    to go and instead of waiting for his arranged transportation they chartered a
                    plane on their own.</p>
                <p>At any rate, to cool things off for a while they shifted me over to head of the
                    American services which was still immigrant visas. My job was to counsel all the
                    American soldiers based in the Philippines or in Vietnam who had found a
                    friendly young lady outside Angeles Air Base. Despite all these rumors about her
                    being a prostitute they decided to marry her and take her home to mom and the
                    kids. I had to interview them about her criminal record and ensure that they
                    wanted to apply for a waiver which was not one of the most pleasant jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time the law prohibited anyone who had been
                        engaged in prostitution from being eligible for a visa and the only way to
                        get it was to get a special waiver through their congressmen. The
                        congressmen weren't delighted in having to do this sort of thing. What
                        happened to the veterans administrator there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: He had planned to leave about a month later but the FBI arrested him
                    and charged him in the United States with fraud and misrepresentation. He was
                    also charged in the Philippines. He had his choice of pleading guilty and being
                    taken back to the United States to be sentenced in the U.S. courts or trying his
                    luck in the Philippine courts. He pleaded guilty and asked for deportation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about other corruption because the Philippines has
                        been renowned over the years for the problem of corruption? Did you or the
                        officers you were serving with run across this type of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Yes and no. It was pervasive. There was a lot of anti American feeling
                    at the time. There was a noted television commentator who was doing an expos�
                    series on those terrible people in the American consulate and was tearing down
                    the character of person after person. He went through 14 officers and he
                    concluded by saying, giving the list of 14 names, “and their ilk.” Everybody
                    turned to me and they gave me a little sign for my desk saying “their ilk.”
                    Everybody was wondering why he had not mentioned my name. I found out his niece
                    was the fifth down in the pile of applications in front of me.</p>
                <p>We were advised not to say what exactly our duties were out in public because if
                    we did we would be inundated with requests, gifts, or what have you. On the
                    other hand it was very mild and good humored. With the exception of this
                    American who had accumulated very large sums of money, mostly it was a matter of
                    just juggling for a little bit of extra advantage. People were quite happy about
                    being told no if it was done politely and they were not surprised when things
                    didn't work out.</p>
                <p>We did have arrested one man for consular fraud then we finally decided that we
                    couldn't press charges and just had him cautioned and released. What he was
                    doing was going down the line of applicants outside saying “I have a friend
                    inside and if you pay me x amount of pesos I will give your name to him and
                    he'll do his best and probably get you the visa. But I'll tell you what, it
                    won't cost you a thing unless you get the visa. If you get the visa, you just
                    pay me the equivalent of $100 and if not, no harm done.” So he signed up
                    hundreds of people for this. He had nobody inside the consulate but some of them
                    got visas and some didn't. Those who got visas were paying him the money
                    assuming that he had done something. He certainly had not broken any U.S. law
                    and it was very hard to figure out any charge that fit.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: The consul general was a man named Lou Gleek. His wife was one of the
                    famous dragon ladies. She assembled all of the wives of the new junior officers
                    and declared them, in writing, her kindergarten and assigned them tasks like
                    doing her laundry for her.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: No, that was very much that day, which was why when I came back to the
                    Department I joined the group that negotiated with the undersecretary for
                    management about the status of spouses, wives at the time, and wrote for him the
                    new Foreign Service policy on wives which he accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Returning once again, you had the general whose name I

                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: I never met the man who was ambassador when I arrived [William
                    McCormack Blair, Jr.]. He was just leaving and he was too high up to bother with
                    a vice consul. There was a long interregnum and then the general came. He got
                    reassigned and there was another interregnum and then Soapy Williams came. Soapy
                    I knew from Michigan. I knew his family, knew his kids. He didn't think much
                    about being an ambassador. He was a stump politician expert at making friends
                    and influencing people so he said to the Foreign Service staff, “You take care
                    of this embassy stuff, I'm going to go out and make friends.” He stumped
                    throughout the Philippines and was a wonderful personality.</p>

                        else, the consular officers. You were also talking to the young political
                        officers who were dealing with the Marcos regime. At this time, we're
                        talking '67 to '69, what was the impression of the Marcos regime? These
                        things change over the decades but at that time what was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: The young political officers who I did talk to were not allowed to
                    write anything or even look into anything about the Marcos regime, that was the
                    job of the senior officer. They were assigned to extremely focused tasks of
                    monitoring publications of this labor union or the other. I and a group of
                    others started a group (I've even forgotten what we called it) which made
                    ourselves available for speeches and discussions at universities. We went out on
                    weekends and evenings to meet with what turned out to be almost always economic
                    clubs at all the universities discussing U.S./Philippine relations. Nobody from
                    the political section was ever interested in anything we heard at these.</p>
                <p>In general my impression, and those of the other younger officers, was that
                    people in the Philippines believed that the society was breaking down and that
                    something had to be done or it was all going to collapse. There was a great deal
                    of fear, a great deal of pessimism about the future. University students were
                    interested in leaving. University faculty was interested in leaving. The maids
                    were interested in leaving. A major career choice was to get into the U.S. Navy
                    as a steward so that you could apply for citizenship. The warlords, economic or
                    military, were taking over. The government had no authority outside the capital
                    city. The military was believed to be corrupt. It was just a nasty situation and
                    they were looking for a strongman, somebody on a white horse, to come and rescue
                    them. Marcos was seen as personally a good man, a good war reputation, a try er
                    whose hands were tied by a corrupt legislature. His wife was seen as glamorous,
                    exciting, a Jackie Kennedy type figure. As things got worse and worse and worse,
                    it seemed fairly apparent that somebody would take over so it was not a surprise
                    to me that it was Marcos, but he was only one of several candidates.</p>
                <p>The system was not working, it was broken. The main street that the embassy was
                    on was lined with things called day and night clubs. They had a prominent sign
                    as you entered saying “gentlemen are requested to deposit their weapons here”
                    and their armed bouncers who would not let you into the club until you deposited
                    your guns with the gun check girl. This was daily life. The son of the consul
                    was shot by a friend of his showing off the new gun that his daddy had given
                    him. Despite the ambassador's recommendation, they chose to take him to court.
                    He was convicted, sentenced to a fine and a certain period of probation. When
                    they came out of court he ran over to the consul's son who had just gotten out
                    of the hospital from a bullet wound in the stomach and said, “Hey, no hard
                    feelings buddy and look what Daddy just gave me.” He pulled out a brand new
                    pistol that his father had given him as a recompense for this terrible ordeal of
                    going to court. Society had broken down. I don't know what the official embassy
                    image was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody can get into the records to see that. You left
                        there in '69. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: I went to the operations center in the Department and served as a watch
                    officer, editor, for one year, the standard time. I was privy to everything that
                    was going on worldwide. I was speaking to and writing for the principals both in
                    the Department and the White House. I found out that it was a terribly
                    complicated world and that there was a very wide range of capability on the part
                    of the Foreign Service and other representatives abroad. I found that some
                    ambassadors were lousy and some were excellent. I learned how to write
                    concisely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a very good way to understand how the system
                        worked.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: It was an excellent way to understand how the top of the system works,
                    how policy is made in relationship between the Department and the White House. I
                    was there during the Kissinger shift. Kissinger was at the NSC [National
                    Security Council] dictating foreign policy despite whatever the State Department
                    said. Then he shifted over and became secretary of State and immediately, to
                    show you a great awareness of the system, he changed procedures that he had
                    instituted himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The operations center is the place that gets whatever is
                        happening immediately and often policy is dictated by almost instantaneous
                        decisions because there isn't time for deliberation. When Kissinger was over
                        at the NSC, were you informing the NSC on an immediate basis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: The NSC had its own receiver for all of our traffic as well as the CIA,
                    DIA, DOD and everything else. They duplicated all of the equipment so that they
                    received it at the same time. What made a difference was the speed with which
                    somebody in the op center would see something, bring it to the attention of one
                    of the principals and get a response over to the White House or to the NSC. The
                    NSC under Kissinger was very, very hierarchic and the people who got this
                    traffic were very low level. It had to go through many layers before it got to
                    the attention of somebody at the policy level at the NSC. Very often at State we
                    were able to receive it at the same time, get it to the attention of the
                    principal, and have a memo on the desk of Henry Kissinger or the president or
                    whoever before the NSC response to that same telegram had worked its way up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is very interesting because normally you think of the
                        NSC as being a rather small thing and the State Department being a very
                        cumbersome organization and the NSC had fancier footwork.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: The State Department is a large organization but what I found was that
                    there are elements like the op center that are deliberately designed to cut
                    through all of the layers and to get to the people who make a difference. One of
                    the things that Kissinger did when he became Secretary of State was to cut out
                    the direct line to the NSC. He felt that they should be informed through the
                    State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back. You said that you were involved in the
                        changing of the role of the wives of the Foreign Service. Could you explain
                        how the system perceived it at that time, we are talking about '69 or '70,
                        and how things changed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: When I entered in '67 it was the explicit policy of the Foreign Service
                    that a married couple was two for the price of one. It was a phrase that was
                    used in official documents. The explicit statement was that a wife was an
                    employee of the U.S. government with a rank derived from the husband's rank and
                    responsible to a line of command of the wives of the more senior officers. This
                    was almost entirely, but not entirely, representational but they could be called
                    into the embassy to do anything because they owed it to the U.S. government
                    because they were given these nice houses and trips to exotic places and the
                    like.</p>
                <p>Some senior wives abused this system. They were the dragon ladies and they ruled
                    over their little fiefdoms. The enforcement mechanism was that in the annual
                    review of each officer, there was a section which reported on the performance of
                    the wife. Unless you were reported as having a wife who complemented you, you
                    were not considered for promotion, and not considered suitable for senior
                    levels. In some cases you had senior wives who were dedicated people who
                    dedicated their lives to the Foreign Service. They expected the assistance of
                    more junior wives, and expected to help teach them, and train them how to be
                    effective. The assumption was that everybody was equally dedicated and it was
                    voluntary work and it was just organized. In other cases you had senior wives
                    who just tried to use this as an army of slaves to make their lives easier like
                    in the case of Mrs. Gleek with her washing machine breaking down just assigned
                    her laundry to the junior wives. You had some husbands who would turn over to
                    their wives the drafting of that section of the EER, others who did not. I found
                    this to be unacceptable. My wife never asked my permission to do anything, so I
                    did not assume that that gave somebody else the authority to demand such a
                    request.</p>
                <p>We came back from the Philippines exercised about this because of our personal
                    experience. In the process of unionization of the Foreign Service there was a
                    group that was started out of the Secretary's Open Forum which was again part of
                    this ferment and demand to have voices heard in other channels. A sub group of
                    the Open Forum, which I joined the moment it came into existence, felt that we
                    should deal with this issue so we formed a drafting and negotiating group who
                    dealt directly with the under secretary for management, who was Crocker at the
                    time.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Our basic points were that this policy was illegal, it was contrary to laws that
                    had been passed about the status of women, and that it was improper in terms of
                    the stated objective of the Foreign Service representing the United States to
                    have a slave system when we are talking equal rights for women in the rest of
                    the United States. It was also a source of a great deal of inefficiency,
                    discontent, etc. Our major point was that the housing and transportation, etc.
                    for the wives was a condition of employment for the employees, the spouses,
                    almost all husbands at the time. It did not imply any obligation on the part of
                    the spouse who we don't pay because it was part of a contract between the
                    employee and the U.S. government. Eventually the undersecretary for management
                    agreed and said “If you can draft us a policy statement that I can get approved
                    by my masters, we'll send it out.”</p>
                <p>A group of seven of us, including my wife and myself, sat down and we hammered
                    out different alternatives and negotiated it with Crocker. He took it up and
                    came back with demands for changes that one of the under secretaries very much
                    opposed. Eventually we got a document which, while not perfect, was a tremendous
                    improvement and it was sent out as an airgram. Knowing the poor distribution of
                    airgrams, there was an informal distribution which made sure that it got out.
                    Some of the difficulties with it were that there was no way in it dealing with
                    these really dedicated women who wanted to serve the U.S. government and had
                    taken on obligations that were more than one person could handle and expected
                    the help of others who they assumed would do it. There had to be worked out a
                    whole new modus vivendi that talked about the role of a spouse who wanted to
                    contribute as an unpaid volunteer. It went a long way toward eliminating abuses
                    and it felt very good to be involved and to see that it was possible to change
                    something that had been around for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the op center, you were there from '69 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: One year in the op center and then what in those days was kind of
                    normal, I shifted over to INR [Bureau of Intelligence and Research] to fill out
                    a normal tour in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: In INR I was assigned as the analyst of India and Pakistan. I worked in
                    the same office with William Dean Howells who had been born in India. He was the
                    analyst for Afghanistan and Iran and so we just informally shifted jobs. He did
                    the analysis for India and I did it for Afghanistan and we signed each others'
                    names and carried on our business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: When I joined the Foreign Service I had requested an assignment to
                    Afghanistan. They told me no and sent me to the Philippines. When I left the
                    Philippines I requested Afghanistan. They told me no and sent me to the op
                    center. Then they said since you've been a good boy we'll give you something in
                    South Asia at least. But this will be the only time and after that you've got to
                    accept the service discipline and go wherever we wish</p>
                <p>As I mentioned, while in the Philippines and part of the speaking group I had
                    found that almost all of the requests came from economics clubs and I knew
                    absolutely nothing of economics. It was just a blind area for me and I had been
                    trapped in a number of these lectures, or discussions, or what have you by
                    questions that came out of nowhere and I didn't know the answer to them. I had
                    been requesting some long term training in economics, some university training,
                    and had gotten a no because I was coned as a political officer. Then they
                    started the 26 week course at FSI [Foreign Service Institute] so while I was in
                    INR I started using every devise I could think of to get into the 26 week
                    economic course as the exceptional political officer. They finally did let me
                    but only after I signed an agreement that said I was taking this training on the
                    condition that at the end of the training I would accept any assignment that
                    they gave me without protest, and without regard to any other considerations. So
                    I did. I went from INR to the economics course which was a total immersion
                    course and succeeded brilliantly. At the end of that for my sins they told me
                    that regardless of any protest they were going to send me to Kabul, Afghanistan
                    as the economic officer and they didn't want to hear any objections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Kabul from '73 to '76 is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the economic officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: No. I was the junior economic officer, the economic commercial officer,
                    and there was an economic counselor, Bill Rowe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in the '73 to '76 period in
                        Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: When I was there in the Peace Corps, there was a king in Kabul who was
                    a prot�g� of Ataturk. He wanted to be the Ataturk of Afghanistan to modernize
                    the country, modernize society, change things. His wife would appear with the
                    chador, without the head covering. He did a lot of changes and he approved
                    things like high schools for girls.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Immediately before I arrived, his uncle, cousin, and brother in law, all one man,
                    took advantage of Zahir Shah's vacation in Italy and declared that they were
                    going to abolish the kingdom and make a republic of Afghanistan headed by
                    himself, Mohammed Daoud Khan. The State Department thought that this meant that
                    the communists had taken over because Daoud had some training in the Soviet
                    Union. He was very much focused on economic development and saw the Soviet Union
                    in some ways as the model for economic development, as most of the world did,
                    including the United States. We objected to it but we saw it that way. The U.S.
                    was very concerned about this Soviet communist coup, falsely.</p>
                <p>I arrived there in '73 as the first diplomat to arrive after the announcement of
                    the republic. My visa was issued by the royal Afghan embassy and was accepted by
                    the Republic of Afghanistan. What I found was, despite what I had been told in
                    Washington, it still very much a modernist family affair with Daoud disagreeing
                    with his cousin the king about the focus. He thought there should be more focus
                    on economics and less social, and on speed because he wanted things to change
                    quickly. The biggest problem they faced was this huge neighbor to the north, the
                    Soviets, who leaned on them and had the power to lean on them. They had tried
                    under Daoud to get NATO assistance for developing the army and NATO, the U.S.
                    principally, said no because they saw nothing of interest. All of their trade
                    was going through Pakistan, with whom they had a border dispute and had a lot of
                    restriction. Their only access to the rest of the world except the informal
                    access (there had been smugglers for the last 5,000 years) was through the
                    Soviet Union and the Soviet Union dominated them economically and potentially
                    politically. He was trying to develop a modern state, and a more developed
                    state, richer state, without angering this colossus.</p>
                <p>As the economic commercial officer I was right in the middle of a lot of what was
                    happening and it was a very exciting time. I was having some successes. We
                    managed to get some independent development in the oil and gas industry which
                    had been developed by the Soviet Union. They had pipelines that led across the
                    river into the Soviet Union where the only meters were, as it was all exported
                    and measured by the customers. He got some independent development by some
                    western firms. We had American companies coming in and bidding for projects.
                    They got a lot of students out of the country to the U.S. as well as to the
                    Soviet Union. There was a good deal of ferment for which there was mostly a
                    positive reaction, as opposed to the ferment under the Shah when a lot of it was
                    negative because it was social under the king. It was an exciting time. I was
                    there for much of it. I got a medal for knocking a Soviet firm out of the
                    competition for one contract. The American firm lost it also because it went to
                    a German but they still gave me a medal because it had been guaranteed to be a
                    Soviet contract.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the Afghan bureaucracy at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: There was no Afghan bureaucracy, there were Afghan people. They were
                    not quite developed enough to have a bureaucracy. Everything was done on an
                    individual basis. Because I was the teacher sir from Farah and I had cousins of
                    my students in all of these various ministries, I could go in and get things
                    done quite effectively. I spoke the language, I knew something of what was
                    happening outside the city, I knew what towns they came from. There were three
                    or four of us younger officers who were able to operate in this way. Ambassador
                    Ted Eliot supported us entirely against some opposition of some counselors who
                    felt that this was somewhat inappropriate. He told us to go ahead and used our
                    reporting verbatim and gave us every support. It was an exciting time.</p>
                <p>One of the first things that happened was that somebody came to me from the
                    Ministry of Finance and said “Look, we understand that the government of
                    Afghanistan has borrowed a lot of money from the U.S. but we've gotten rid of
                    the old trappings of the kingdom and are now a republic. We don't know how to
                    work these files so could you tell us what we owe you and when because we don't
                    want to default on any loans?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left there in '76, what was the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: I left when everything looked like it was moving forward well and there
                    was real change in the air. There was visible change in the economy of the
                    country, a faint beginning of something like central government and there was
                    beginning to be some acknowledgment of the authority of Kabul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the, you might say, visceral reaction of the American
                        government to this new one as being sort of a Soviet system developing, kind
                        of died down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: It very much diminished partly because the Saudis and the Iranians and
                    others had decided to provide some support on their own and they were beginning
                    to realize that this was not a Soviet puppet. There was still a great deal of
                    unhappiness about UN votes because they did vote the Soviet line on everything
                    that the Soviets considered important but on other things there was the apparent
                    evidence that it was not a Soviet puppet. The expectations were high for
                    continued improvement.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>As a matter of fact I had gotten into serious trouble it seemed finding out some
                    of this. When I had gone to Iran to take my Foreign Service exam, I played chess
                    with a young man in the Ministry of Finance. Eight years later he came on an
                    official visit to Kabul as the head of foreign assistance in the Ministry of
                    Finance, a deputy secretary, or undersecretary. I don't know what his
                    ministerial rank was but it was senior and he was now in charge of all foreign
                    assistance. I invited him over to my house to play chess and pumped him about
                    the Shah's plans for Afghanistan. I sent in a long cable about this which my
                    ambassador thought was great. Then we got a rocket from Ambassador Helms next
                    door in Iran demanding to know who was responsible for this outrage because in
                    Iran access to ministerial level people was strictly limited to heads of
                    departments and had to be cleared by the ambassador so that there was a single
                    voice. This had not been reported out of Iran and to have this major report on
                    Iranian plans for Afghanistan to be coming out of Kabul was unacceptable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about a period in Iran where later there was
                        much criticism because there was too much control from the top and only one
                        voice was being heard, not picking up the fact that it was a country getting
                        ready for revolution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Yes and that one voice spoke only to the Shah and saw things with the
                    same limitations as the Shah saw them. I had already been assigned to Iran as my
                    next assignment as principal officer and consul in Tabriz. The ambassador almost
                    broke the assignment. He didn't want me but with a message from Ted Eliot saying
                    that I was a promising officer and did understand discipline, he decided to
                    allow me to come. I went to Iran for my next assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '76 to '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Yes, also an interesting period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, a very interesting period. First place, you went as
                        the consul in Tabriz is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First what was the situation in Tabriz and how did the
                        consulate work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: It was a very small consulate. I had one vice consul and a small local
                    staff. They had cut down drastically. It had been a major center with a large
                    AID program but as Iran got rich the AID program disappeared so the economic
                    staff disappeared and everything had been reduced. They had been considering
                    making it a consular post only to do consular duties but there was a war between
                    the Kurds out of Iran with Iraq. There was also the very large Soviet border, a
                    permeable border with the Azerbaijanis on both sides, and there was all the
                    commercial traffic and personal traffic to Europe through the Turkish border.
                    They felt that in addition to a vice consul who would do consular work, they
                    needed a political officer, a real Foreign Service officer, to be the principal
                    officer and monitor basically those three things.</p>
                <p>There was also the principal question in the mission in Iran, internally, of what
                    happens after the Shah? Everybody in Iran knew that the Shah was working himself
                    out of a job and that there were going to be significant changes when he left.
                    He had scheduled his departure for '80 when he was going to abdicate in favor of
                    his son so there was a need to do reporting to find out what was going to
                    happen. Since the Shah's wife was from Tabriz and there was a different national
                    group in the empire because of the Kurds, the Azerbaijanis, and the Armenians
                    all potentially troublesome, they felt they wanted reporting.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately I got very mixed signals and was very lucky in the handling of it.
                    Almost the very first message I received was a cable from State Department
                    addressed to Teheran, Tabriz, Isfahan, Shiraz, etc., (I was an individual
                    addressee) which asked for an assessment of the attitude of the people of my
                    district toward the Shah. I went out and interviewed people and I wrote that I
                    found the attitude significantly different with the different population groups
                    but none of it was very happy. I sent it in through Teheran because I had no
                    communications facilities. About two weeks later I got a rocket from Washington
                    saying you had a request, an instruction for a report and the due date was two
                    weeks ago. When are you going to send the report? I called up Teheran and found
                    out that Ambassador Helms had asked that all the reporting from the consulates
                    be sent to him. He read them and decided that this was not quite the correct
                    view so he had sent the embassy report and put in there a line saying this
                    represents also the consulate reporting.</p>
                <p>I called him up and said “Sir, this was addressed to me as principal officer and
                    I've now gotten another one demanding my response. I feel that I should send in
                    my response. I have also seen embassy Teheran's response and while that may be
                    true in the capital district among Persians it does not accurately represent
                    what I am seeing out here.” He said, “Are you questioning my judgment?” I said,
                    “No sir. I am suggesting that my observation is of different fact and that
                    difference may be important. Washington has asked for my view and I feel I ought
                    to send it.” He said, “No.” I said, “Well the secretary has put up this back
                    channel for information and it will go in directly to him. If you don't wish to
                    send it officially I will send it through the back channel.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the so called open forum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Yes, through the open forum. It had a different name but I've forgotten
                    what the name was. He said “If you send that, this is the last assignment you
                    will get in the Foreign Service. Do you realize who you are speaking to?” He
                    detailed his employment history as head of CIA, etc. He said, “You are directly
                    defying my authority. You have no right to do so and you will back down or you
                    are through.” I said, “I am sending it sir, I am sorry.” The next day he was
                    indicted on Watergate issues by a grand jury in Alexandria and he forgot to take
                    the time to discipline an obstreperous young officer. My report did go in. The
                    DCM became charg�. He called and said “What was the resolution on this?” I said,
                    “We talked about it and I said that I would prefer to have it sent in officially
                    but if not I will send it in through the open forum. Ambassador Helms disagreed
                    and I said I would send it one way or the other.” He said, “I don't think we
                    have to go that far” so we sent it officially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On this, how did you feel? Were you getting contact with
                        the political officers at the embassy and all? How were they feeling? Were
                        they feeling under constraints?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: They were feeling under tremendous constraints. The absolute rule under
                    Helms was that the only person that could talk to the Shah was the ambassador.
                    To speak to any minister you must be the head of a department and only with the
                    permission of the ambassador. Any other contacts with government officials had
                    to be done at the appropriate level by rank under the direct approval of the
                    head of an office. People were hearing things, were writing them up and were
                    finding them ignored. They were not being sent in. There was a major use of
                    memcons.</p>
                <p>Curiously enough where I found the greatest frustration was among the CIA
                    officers in Teheran because their commission was explicit and unalterable. They
                    were to look only at the threat only from the Soviet Union: communist
                    infiltration, support, sabotage, pressures for change from the Soviet Union.
                    They had much wider access and were talking with military officers, union
                    people, religious people, but they were not allowed to report on anything except
                    the Soviet threat. They were passing things to me which I was sending in to my
                    friends, my colleagues, in INR and elsewhere who understood the source even
                    though they could not cite it. I would put “I have heard” and they would
                    understand what that meant. But there was a great deal of information in the
                    mission that was just not being reported.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often when this happens it gets reported. This was true in
                        Vietnam under Graham Martin and the last days of Vietnam, and under Howard
                        Jones in Indonesia with Sukarno. What happens is that there is the use of
                        official informal letters, or informal informal letters, or visits come out.
                        In other words, one doesn't really stop the flow. What happens is at a
                        certain point the ambassador becomes essentially discredited by those that
                        have to use information, by those who have to make decisions. There is this
                        flow underneath.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: One of the things that often contributes to that underground flow is
                    that different agencies are reporting different things. Specifically the DCI,
                    the intelligence community depending on reports from the CIA stations, is
                    reporting something different than the ambassador is reporting. The DIA is
                    another important source. But we had an unusual situation in Teheran where the
                    ambassador who maintained very strict controls over the Foreign Service
                    reporting, was a former head of the CIA. Through direct command and through his
                    contacts he exercised at least equal, if not greater control over CIA reporting
                    and had somebody who agreed with his mind set as the defense attach�.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the jobs of political officers in the Foreign
                        Service is to analyze what the mind set is, why people do things and all in
                        foreign countries. You can't help but also apply you might say this same
                        analysis to your own place particularly if you have a very strong minded
                        arbitrary ambassador. What was sort of what you and others were feeling
                        about Helms? Why was he acting in this way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: He was a true believer and felt that the Shah was the major force for
                    change in Iran. He was the leader of his country and the man who would bring
                    development, democracy and strawberries and cream to the whole region. He was
                    the picked U.S. surrogate and had the support of a president of the United
                    States, Mr. Nixon, who came out, met the Shah, and turned and said to the
                    ambassador and to Pentagon representatives “Give him whatever he wants.”</p>
                <p>It was not a matter so much of suppressing different impressions of the same
                    information, bureaucratically he was very effective in that he suppressed
                    contact. Where perhaps a strong minded junior officer might hear something in
                    the bazaar from a sweeper in the ministry of whatever, he would go in and speak
                    to his boss who had just had an hour long meeting with the minister of whatever.
                    Where the two images differed, they would assume that that junior sweeper from
                    the ministry was either ignorant, or not in the know, or pushing a different
                    agenda because they had it from the horse's mouth. There was nobody else
                    speaking to the Shah so nobody reported any doubts in front of the Shah. There
                    was nobody else speaking to the ministers and the deputy ministers.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>There was a very similar thing with the consulates and the embassy. If a
                    consulate reported something that was at odds with what the embassy was
                    reporting, the embassy, the ambassador, would have a note attached to the bottom
                    saying that while this report is interesting and perhaps even dangerous, they
                    had checked it out with senior authorities and found that it does not correspond
                    with the facts as best they can determine so it should be read as a view from
                    some individual out in the provinces. It might help fill out the edges but it's
                    not the truth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm dwelling on this because I think the situation in
                        Iran, I'm really talking about from the American professional point of view,
                        was particularly bad and that you had a awful lot of frustration of people
                        feeling that the real story wasn't getting out. Probably nothing would have
                        happened anyway other than we might have gotten our people out of there
                        sooner but other than that the situation in Iran was being stifled really
                        coming from the top. It was the president and Kissinger who fell in love
                        with the Shah almost and they had an ambassador who wouldn't tell what was
                        really happening.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: No, who believed. He did speak up but he believed. There were
                    particular issues in which Helms and the Shah differed and Helms would be very
                    forthright on those issues. But it was still a single voice speaking to a single
                    man and Helms, with Kissinger and Nixon, believed that the Shah was the best and
                    greatest hope not only for Iran but for the U.S. in the area. Nobody was
                    interested in retailing stories that would cause the Shah problems when they
                    were just minority opinions. As I know from personal experience, Helms as an
                    individual was willing and capable of using his contacts to threaten the careers
                    of anybody who upset his apple cart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the mullahs and the religious side, can you
                        tell me how you observed during your '76 to '79 period the spread of
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: I was in Tabriz for only one year. Toward the end of my first year I
                    got a call from the DCM in Teheran, I think it was Charlie Naas. Basically what
                    he said was that there was real trouble in central Iran, in Isfahan. What we've
                    got down there right now as principal officer is somebody who knows consular
                    regulations backward and forward but has not done any reporting about anything
                    other than the number of visas issued since he got there. They asked if I would
                    be willing to trade places with him which means that people in Teheran were
                    looking at my reporting. They felt that I was able to do something and that they
                    were aware of things going on even if the consulate was not reporting.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>You are right, and reporting was going to Washington mostly in the forms of
                    memcons, official informals and the like. I know that the assumption in the
                    mission was that these were being read and Helms' reports were being considered
                    one-sided. I found out later that that was just not true. People were not
                    getting to airgrams, memcons and things or if they did they just never added
                    them up. Anyway, I did not have a great deal to do with the mullahs in
                    Tabriz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was also not a center for it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: No. I knew the ayatollah of Tabriz. I had talked with him a lot about
                    Islam and my background but I dealt much more with the principal clergy of the
                    Armenians. The man in Tabriz eventually became the patriarch, the pope of the
                    Armenian church worldwide. He was a useful contact and a source of much
                    information on the Armenians. The Kurds were considered heretics by most Muslims
                    because their sect, the Alawi, practically deified the Ali, the son in law of
                    the prophet. I didn't have much to do other than regular social contact with the
                    clergy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation vis � vis the United States with
                        the Kurds at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: While I was there the situation changed dramatically. When I was
                    assigned to Tabriz the United States, through the CIA and the Shah, was directly
                    arming and supporting Kurdish separatists that were headquartered in Iran in the
                    Tabriz district in their war with Saddam Hussein in Iraq. The Shah considered
                    Saddam Hussein his major enemy and the United States, as a friend of the Shah,
                    was willing to support the Kurds as a surrogate fighter against Saddam Hussein.
                    While I was in Tabriz, Saddam Hussein and the Shah signed a peace treaty
                    delineating the border and settling major issues including ownership of some oil
                    fields. With prospects of changing the eons long war relationship between the
                    two countries, as of the date of the signing of that secret treaty (a total
                    surprise) the Kurds were cut off absolutely. Even things in the pipeline that
                    they had paid for just were not delivered. The intelligence support, and
                    warnings of attacks were cut off along with everything else.</p>
                <p>The Iraqis who had been informed that this would happen, opened a major offensive
                    against the Kurdish villages causing a major flood of refugees into both Iran
                    and Turkey. I date from that period the formation of two very separate political
                    wings among the Kurds. They had been fairly well united in their war with Saddam
                    Hussein but the reaction of the Turks and the Iranians was very different. The
                    Turks tried to shove them back into Iraq where they were being killed and used a
                    lot of force. The Iranians let them come in and said as long as you don't cause
                    any trouble for us, we won't cause any trouble for you. So the Iranian side of
                    the Kurds maintained their hatred for Saddam Hussein, deeply distrusted the U.S.
                    and Iran, but didn't hate, and were willing to consider other than military
                    solutions because they were disillusioned with war. The Kurds centered in Turkey
                    hated the Turks, hated Saddam Hussein, and moved to a terrorist option which has
                    been a split that has been maintained ever since.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>At any rate, I knew Barzani, the leader. I knew his two sons and after he died I
                    continued to meet with them. They felt that the fault was the Shah's and that he
                    had somehow persuaded the United States to take an action that was contrary to
                    U.S. interests. They tried to use me as a channel for this view. In fact, the
                    U.S. was very much aware of the implications of its actions and was willing to
                    make a sacrifice of the Kurds for our other interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, of course, was the period of both Nixon and
                        Kissinger, who were very much realpolitik and there wasn't much hand
                        wringing over anybody who got caught in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: It was a bi polar world and what happened in the fringes was important
                    only in so far as it affected the struggle between the U.S. and the Soviet
                    Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved down to Isfahan. Could you describe what
                        Isfahan was like at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: I moved to Isfahan because of rumors of trouble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in '78 wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Right. It is old Persia and in the province of Fars from which the
                    land, the language and the people get their name. It has a history and a feeling
                    that it should be in charge of Iran and the world for that matter. It has old
                    monuments, old archeology, a long established tradition. They felt that Teheran
                    was a nothing village that had just pumped itself up. It saw itself as very much
                    the center of religious life with the oldest established schools for the mullahs
                    and the like.</p>
                <p>The city and region was struggling with the Shah's modernization. The Shah had
                    selected Isfahan as the site for the headquarters of the military industrial
                    complex. He built the largest air base, the base for the army helicopter
                    divisions and training, major factory complexes that were related to the
                    military and other factory complexes that were unrelated. There were some 27,000
                    foreigners, Americans and otherwise, that had been moved in to support this new
                    industrial military complex in what had been a town of about 100,000. The
                    Iranian population had boomed to about 400,000 with all the military and the
                    employees.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>It was a totally disjointed social setup because the influx was almost 100
                    percent young males and Iranian social structure is very, very dependent on
                    external social controls. The grandmother sits and whips kids into shape. People
                    are punished for infractions and they are never taught any personal discipline.
                    It is always social controls. All of these young men came without families,
                    without wives, without mothers, without a village, and without any mechanism for
                    defining the social rules. There were lots of liquor stores, lots of theaters,
                    lots of nightclubs, lots of prostitution and drinking but no structure to
                    control it.</p>
                <p>Isfahan is also the home of the largest population of Christians and Jews outside
                    of Tabriz. The Jews had been brought over by an early king and established there
                    as the goldsmiths, the illuminators, and the skilled craftsmen. They became very
                    wealthy and were therefore a target of envy. The Christians had a ghetto of
                    Armenian Christians which was very large. Again, they were well educated and an
                    object of envy. Particularly for these relatively uneducated young men who were
                    brought in working in the military or working in the factories and had nothing
                    to do with their lives outside of it, one of the things that they did was pursue
                    women. A woman without a veil was assumed to be a prostitute. The fact that most
                    of the women without veils were either Jews or Christians or my family added to
                    the tension.</p>
                <p>The Americans brought in some 14,000 of the 26,000 27,000 and they were no
                    prizes. Bell Helicopter was the largest single employer and had 7,000 of the
                    total. It had targeted people with helicopter experience in Vietnam,
                    specifically targeting those who had married a Vietnamese or Thai or Burmese
                    wife and had taken them back home to west Texas or Tennessee and found they
                    didn't quite fit in. They brought these people here, built a ghetto for them and
                    expected them to behave properly without any incentives, so there was an awful
                    lot of social tension.</p>
                <p>Because of this, in Isfahan I did have a lot of contact with the religious
                    because I was looking to the religious authorities as one of the centers of
                    possible mediation of these tensions. I got to know the ayatollah very well.
                    After I had talked with him, at his request I talked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which ayatollah was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: The ayatollah of Isfahan, not Khomeini, who was not a real ayatollah.
                    At his invitation, I taught a weekly class at two of the largest schools for the
                    mullahs on the Bible. I became a member of the faculty and could talk to the
                    senior religious on a regular basis. I found some very disturbing things because
                    what was happening was that there were men wearing the clothes of mullahs coming
                    in and preaching political things at the mosques. “False mullahs” they called
                    them. Whether they were false mullahs or merely mullahs who were social zealots
                    who were preaching a different thing, I never could determine. What is a false
                    mullah since there is no official clergy? Among other things, they were
                    Khomeini's people or people who were preaching in the Khomeini name.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>What I found was a military that had no idea what the Shah wanted, angry young
                    men who just wanted things to be good with a very unfocused anger, students and
                    businessmen who were very upset about the lack of authority, responsibility
                    available to them under the Shah's Iran. I also found constitutionalists, mostly
                    middle class, who felt that the Shah was moving much too slow on social and
                    political reforms, and traditionalists who felt that all of this change was
                    terrible. Everybody was angry. It was unfocused, it was not targeted but it was
                    real and incidents would blow it up so I was very concerned about possible
                    incidents with Americans. It felt like the beginning of a revolution and I
                    reported it as such to Teheran and apparently so did Shiraz and the junior
                    officer in Tabriz. We went up and had a conference with the principal officers
                    in Teheran and Teheran said that they have just not seen any such evidence. This
                    was after Helms had left but there was still a charg�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Carter administration had come in by this time hadn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: About this time the Carter administration came in. One of the incidents
                    which made people explode was Carter's first announcement about human rights and
                    the importance of democracy and everything else, had given a great deal of
                    feeling of support to democrats, Christian Democratic Party people, the middle
                    class, business, and the students. Then he made an announcement after some
                    incident that happened elsewhere saying that he supported the Shah 100 percent.
                    They felt betrayed and they translated that as anger at Americans. They didn't
                    know what the Americans were saying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there at the time when the Shah had his
                        millennial meeting of ....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: The 2,000 year anniversary in the tent. I was not present at that
                    celebration outside Shiraz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that sit very well, do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Actually I think that it became a cause celebre but at the time it
                    seemed to suit people fine. It was the kind of thing that you expected the Shah
                    to do. It was showing off Iran and himself. You expect an oriental despot to do
                    a bit of showing off. They didn't understand Jimmy Carter and his self effacing.
                    Was he saying that he was weaker and poorer than the Shah?</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>At any rate, what we had and what we were reporting from the provinces was an
                    incipient revolution. We had a big conference in Teheran and they said we just
                    need more evidence. There are no indications of this in Teheran. We are just not
                    hearing it. So we went back and continued to report. In effect, we had in
                    Isfahan a successful revolution. The Comit� came into being and just took over.
                    The military withdrew to its bases, the government withdrew, the policemen were
                    afraid to go into the crowded areas and so the Comit�s began to patrol the
                    streets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Comit�s being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Groups usually centered around one or more religious, that are there to
                    promote social discipline, to enforce “right behavior” and to overthrow the
                    Shah, if necessary, if he didn't reform. They were certainly there to smash up
                    liquor stores that were serving Iranians, close down movie theaters that were
                    showing pornography. It was a religious political amalgam. Some of them were the
                    followers of various religious figures who were carrying out instructions. Some
                    of them were bunches of students who wanted to throw their weight around and who
                    co opted a religious figure and said you're it. Eventually in Isfahan the
                    ayatollah organized the comit�s in the central city under his authority and they
                    became a disciplined group for the city and provincial government. On the
                    outskirts there were the more radical and more dangerous ones who were the first
                    ones with guns, well supplied. Teheran and the United States continued to say
                    that there was no evidence other than regional disorders and uncertainties.</p>
                <p>At about this time I had to take the step of asking the military who were
                    providing security on my post, to withdraw and got the ayatollah to send his
                    people over for security. This was done very quietly because the embassy said
                    that an announcement of this would look like the United States was on the wrong
                    side. But it was on the request of the military who felt that their people were
                    a target sitting in front of the consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Americans here? Here you have this group, I
                        know it well, that gather around where there is a large military and other
                        types of expenditure of the United States. One could almost call them the
                        boomers. They can be very unruly, very difficult. One hears stories about
                        motorcycles being driven up into mosques and all of that. What were the
                        problems you had as the consul in Isfahan in dealing with Americans who were
                        moving beyond their ghetto and getting into trouble outside?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: I was negotiating for release from various comit�s an average of about
                    ten Americans a week. Four guys would go out, pick up a girl and take her out
                    with a case of liquor in the car with obvious intentions. They would maybe be
                    stopped by a patrol of comit�s and they would be arrested. They would scream for
                    the consul and I would have to go and persuade them to my care.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>The worst incident was a little bit later when I actually organized an
                    evacuation. I had quietly negotiated flights directly into the Isfahan military
                    air base for company-chartered planes so that they wouldn't go to the airport
                    and it could be done quietly. I had moved people into a hotel in central Isfahan
                    so they could go in convoy rather than try to collect from the individual homes.
                    The first flight out was supposed to be at four o'clock in the morning. I went
                    and did a bed check (I know these people) about two and found one room empty. I
                    went out and found a jeep had been stolen. We caught the guys as they were
                    leaving a brand new mosque which had just been completed in the center of a new
                    residential area. These were people scheduled on the first flight out. They had
                    taken a ladder and some buckets and on the marble side of this new mosque had
                    written “Jesus saves you fucking ragheads” and were going to sneak back to their
                    beds and leave town the next morning. Between two and four, they spent the night
                    whitewashing the mosque. For some reason, their names slipped off the first
                    flight and they didn't get on until the last flight out.</p>
                <p>They caused trouble. They would go into the bazaar and be yelling back and forth
                    at each other. They would wear inappropriate clothing, and they would laugh at
                    the Iranians. They would be drinking and displaying in public and they caused a
                    lot of difficulty. We worked out a modus vivendi. The comit�s would arrest them,
                    throw them into a dirty cell and let them sit. Within four hours they would
                    notify me and I would come and get them out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Bell Helicopter and any other companies, one
                        thinks of Ross Perot's company and all these? Talking about at your level
                        and your area, were they concerned about what was happening and trying to do
                        anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Bell Helicopter had no interest whatsoever. As long as they were
                    getting paid, they paid no attention. Their headquarters was in Teheran. Their
                    payment was coming out of the military procurement. Their senior officials left
                    Isfahan and I found out, for example, that since no one knew the quality of the
                    people that they were dealing with, they had seized passports of every employee
                    and had them locked in a safe in Teheran. When I had to evacuate these people,
                    no passports were available so I had to issue passports, crossing my fingers,
                    for some 7,000 people, working at midnight, my wife typing and me putting
                    pictures on. With these 7,000 people there were approximately 125 by the end
                    (because I had tried to get the others out earlier) non American citizen spouses
                    for whom no embassies existed in Iran, certainly nothing in Isfahan. Since I had
                    gotten these flights into the air base and they were going to go directly out to
                    Greece, I took them some sheets of parchment and I wrote out “I, David C.
                    McGaffey, consul general of the United States in and for Isfahan, do declare
                    that Hung Mon Sui, a citizen and national of Thailand, is traveling in the
                    company of American citizen spouse so and so, passport number such and such. I
                    request all officials to give her every assistance and allow her to pass
                    unimpeded.” I put a seal on the top and a seal on the bottom and stretched some
                    ribbon and I said “This is worthless but see what happens to it.” The State
                    Department was very upset when they found out that I had issued these.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of us do this. These are non documents that you have
                        to issue sometimes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Bell just ignored their people. On the other hand Grumman went out of
                    its way to make sure that its people were safe and were informed. They gave
                    early departure to anybody who wished it. They urged dependents and people with
                    medical difficulties to leave early. They were consulting with me on a daily
                    basis and they were the ones who did the arrangements for the actual charters
                    and the flights. I persuaded Bell to pay for the flights that were carrying
                    mostly Bell employees but they were unwilling to do anything to make any
                    arrangements because it might upset the Iranians who were paying them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: I left in May. The Shah left in January.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about '79.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the sort of end game from your point of
                        view, not what happened afterwards. What determined to get the Americans out
                        of there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: About the same time that I was sending messages to Teheran, I gathered
                    the heads of all of the companies and told them my feeling and my disturbances
                    and suggested that it might be a good idea to send people with difficulties on
                    leave. Interestingly enough there was a fairly large Israeli irrigation project
                    and two days later I called the companies back to find out what action, if any,
                    they had taken after this meeting and I couldn't find any Israelis. Every one of
                    them had left two days earlier. Most of the American companies took limited
                    action. Then there were almost daily demonstrations and it was a matter of
                    seeking authorization from Washington, which was not forthcoming, to declare an
                    evacuation, working with the companies on lowering profiles, and the like. I
                    arranged for example for dealers in food stuffs and basic goods to go out to the
                    American compounds to prevent the need for Americans to go into the markets.</p>
                <p>Eventually, against the recommendations from Washington, I felt that I couldn't
                    guarantee the safety of the children and closed the American school. At that
                    point, a lot of the women and children left. I worked with Iranian authorities
                    to restrict work areas and transport and the like. We had by this time violent
                    demonstrations on a daily basis. Places where Americans were known to frequent
                    got firebombed at night, not while they were opened but when they were closed.
                    Unfortunately that included my home. I lived above the store at the post and
                    they didn't realize that, so they firebombed the consulate underneath the
                    bedroom of my children. I finally got authority for my wife and children to
                    leave with one suitcase each in a military transport.</p>
                <p>Then two incidents happened which convinced people. A bomb was thrown into a bus
                    carrying Bell Helicopter employees and, for the grace of God, it got smothered.
                    There was one casualty, an American who got a piece of shrapnel in his behind.
                    Because the location was amusing, people somehow accepted that without panic.
                    Then a mob surrounded the Grumman building and I believe by accident, but who
                    knows, set fire to it. Two Air Force officers, who I obtained a silver star for
                    eventually, went into the burning building, collected the employees, got them
                    out a back way and got them to my residence. There were no injuries but the
                    building was a total loss. At that point there was agreement for evacuation but
                    the roads between Isfahan and Teheran were no longer safe. They had been taken
                    over by radicals and there was a lot of shooting up. I was unwilling to
                    authorize a drive to Teheran. Teheran by this time had decided there was
                    something going on and was authorizing commercial flights out. That was when I
                    got the aircraft into Isfahan through the air base.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Just in time for the second flight I had some 400 Americans in this hotel. One of
                    these characters who had volunteered to be a late departure was going around to
                    all of the families slated for departure and saying “The company is forcing my
                    to stay here but I had to move out of my place. Could you sell me some things
                    cheap so I could furnish a little flat?” He was buying up for pennies the
                    property of everybody that was leaving and selling them through an Iranian taxi
                    driver. He and the taxi driver got into a fight in front of the hotel and he
                    pulled out a gun and shot the taxi driver who was trying to knife him. Within
                    minutes the rumor had it that Americans were standing on the balconies of the
                    hotel shooting at Iranians going by and they had killed 15, etc. By the time I
                    got there they had drums of petroleum stacked along the bottom floor of the
                    hotel and were planning to burn the whole place down.</p>
                <p>I called the military and asked for an escort to arrest the guy and take him out
                    of there. The military refused, so I called the ayatollah and he sent over six
                    of his mullahs. We finally got the guy out of the hotel, both the Iranian in
                    there wounded and the American. At that time we got the mullahs and the American
                    into the car but I didn't get in so I was seized by the mob, shot, stabbed,
                    hanged and had both of my kneecaps broken. They then tried to run me over with a
                    truck and the truck put one wheel into a drainage ditch and tilted up on its
                    side so I was able to roll under the truck and begin speaking to people. I
                    talked my way out of that and got them to arrest me and take me to the
                    ayatollah. He gave me refuge and treated my wounds.</p>
                <p>About that time Teheran decided that there was justification for an evacuation
                    order so we got full support then. We got everybody out and I closed office as
                    soon as every foreigner was out of the district who was willing to leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might add that this was when you get later an award for
                        heroism for this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Yes, the one time that I screwed up trying to get an American out of a
                    bad situation I got a medal. All the times that I succeeded, they ignored.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that towards the end, as far as
                        closing up the post, it must have been pretty hairy up to the very end.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: It was extremely hairy. We had men with guns in the building objecting
                    to things like my burning up my passports and visas. They were threatening me
                    and my family until I got them out. We had prospects of incidents that could
                    have resulted in multiple deaths. For one month every morning the man at the
                    garage at the school would call me and say “Should I send the buses out?” At
                    four o'clock in the morning I would have to decide yes or no and put the lives
                    of all of those kids at risk. It was hairy. It was terrible. By this time they
                    had named me consul general because the Soviet representative was a consul
                    general and they didn't want him ranking me. But I was the only western
                    diplomatic representative and I was the one who everybody looked to. I was one
                    of the few people who could talk to the military, and to the governor, and to
                    the ayatollah, to all of the various authorities. I felt every day as if very
                    inadequate shoulders were carrying a lot of lives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about getting the Americans out of there, were a lot
                        digging their heels in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: About 20 individuals elected to stay. Probably 15 of those were married
                    to Iranians and the other five were young people who had good contacts and felt
                    they wanted to stay. Because it was gradual, the most vulnerable ones left
                    first. The fact that others had left and the fact that tensions were increasing
                    made it a matter of just scheduling them to get them out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get out of there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: When there was nobody else left, I and my remaining staff piled into
                    three cars loaned to us by the ayatollah that were festooned with some 25 people
                    from his comit�s with heavy weaponry. We drove to Teheran and we had more
                    weapons than anybody at the roadblocks. I got into Teheran and found out that
                    meanwhile the embassy had been taken over by security comit�s who almost had a
                    fire fight with my comit�s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to finish off this part, were you in Teheran
                        long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: When they found out my physical condition they medevaced me as soon as
                    they could to Greece, which was where my family was. I was there for about six
                    weeks. As soon as I was capable again, they sent me back to Teheran because they
                    needed somebody who could speak the language and knew something of the history
                    because everyone who had dealt with the Shah was persona non grata. I went back
                    as acting political counselor in Teheran, acting DCM I guess for a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Until the end of September. I left about 40 days before the final
                    takeover. I was there for three takeovers. I helped get the release of the
                    people from the first takeover when I was still in Isfahan but left before the
                    444 day one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the embassy by the time you got there
                        when you came back from Greece? What was sort of the mood of the
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: It was badly divided between those who felt that the worst was over and
                    things were coming back to normal, and those who felt that there was no
                    government, there was no social control and we should all get out. Bruce Laingen
                    had been brought in as charg� and accepted the feeling of those who felt that
                    the worst was over and tried to build up to a normal staff. I and the acting DCM
                    both sent exit messages recommending that the embassy be closed and were asked
                    what would happen if the U.S. admitted the Shah. I said there would be a
                    disaster but it was one of two opinions. We had people lined up in lines for
                    visa applications who were handing their guns to friends so they could get into
                    the line, apply for the visa and then go back and pick up their guns and
                    demonstrate in front of the front door. It was a very confusing situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just looking at the time and we have to stop at this
                        point. I don't know if there is anything else, there is an awful lot I
                        suppose about Iran but if you want to talk any more about Teheran at this
                        point we can cover that the next time, then we will pick up thereafter.
                        We're talking about up through September '79.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the 30th of January 1998. It has been a while. Was there anything else
                    you can think of as far as going out of Teheran? You left in September was that
                    it?</p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: That's correct. I went to Greece, picked up my family and went off to
                    Harvard for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were taking off in September what was your
                        feeling about whither? You said we probably should get the hell out but how
                        did you think things would work out on departure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: On departure I felt that Iran was going to have to go through a long
                    period of turmoil before it got its own act together. I had already been through
                    personally two takeovers of the embassy and had seen others. I certainly knew
                    that any Americans behind were at risk but I in no way predicted the 465 day
                    takeover or whatever.</p>

                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am not sure if we covered this before because we haven't
                        listened to all the previous tape, just the last part, but what were
                        American firms doing by the time you got out of there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: American firms basically had left. Everyone had been evacuated who was
                    willing to go. We had a roster, if my memory serves me, of about 42 people who
                    stayed in Iran for various reasons: they were married to Iranians, or there were
                    two students in Isfahan who were studying political science who felt that the
                    risk was worth the unique expertise that they would get. All of the American
                    companies and organizations had pulled out. There were just individuals left.
                    The feeling was the that there would be no place for American business or for
                    that matter for real diplomacy until the Iranians fought it out among themselves
                    and decided what kind of a country, what kind of a government, what kind of a
                    future they wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the embassy get involved with the problem that occurs
                        when you have something like this and that is American women married to
                        Iranians who have children. Some of them may have wanted to get out but the
                        children couldn't leave. Was this a problem or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: At the time that I was there and up to the time that I left, we
                    definitely got involved but it was not particularly a problem. It was just a
                    matter of making late night appointments so that people could renew passports
                    and the like. Most of the American women married to Iranians were married to
                    people of the class who were very nervous about the way things were going and
                    were not at all upset about the thought of their wives and children getting out
                    until things calmed down. There were later some problems but at that time it was
                    just assisting Americans and getting documentation so they could leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were off to Harvard. What were you taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: I went to the Kennedy School at Harvard for a one year sabbatical from
                    '79 to '80. I did end up taking a degree, an MPA, public administration. I
                    started out by going back to Washington and debriefing and I was astonished at
                    the level of ignorance in Washington. People did not know what was happening in
                    Iran. People had preconceptions, or misconceptions, or no conceptions of what
                    was going on and they were making policy decisions.</p>
                <p>They were saying they had really not expected the Shah to leave because Iran
                    always has these eruptions every once in a while and then they calm down, that's
                    how the Iranians let off steam. So they are waiting for the Iranians to finish
                    letting off steam now. I gave Gary Sick my impressions and I got the clear
                    impression that my impressions had made no impression at all. He was the one who
                    had paper weights on various in boxes on his desk. He had a shell covering the
                    Pentagon in box, a metal dollar sign for Treasury, and a little dancing Shiva.
                    He said, “Do you know what that is?” I said “What?” He said, “That's the State
                    Department, you know on the one hand, then on the other hand, then on the other
                    hand, then on the other hand.”</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your debriefings did you find that there were schools
                        of thought or was it pretty much essentially a non school of thought but
                        people were running off in different directions on the moment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: I found that up to the level of the desk officer, people had become
                    persuaded of pretty much the same thing that the embassy was reporting. Above
                    the level of the desk officer people had no knowledge of, and therefore very
                    little opinion of Iran. They really had schools of thought on U.S. policy which
                    was made regardless of what was happening on the ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go to the Harvard time. You were there during a good
                        part of the crises at our embassy and the takeover of the embassy, all of
                        which sort of fixated the United States. Did you find that Harvard was
                        making use of you at all for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: No. Harvard did not make use of me on this at all. The State Department
                    did. Almost immediately after the takeover I got a call from the future
                    Secretary of State, Christopher, who wanted to know if I had any desire to be
                    useful and had any contacts that might help out. It turned out that I had in my
                    personal notebook the telephone numbers that rang at the front desk in the
                    Foreign Ministry where our charg� and political counselor were at the time,
                    Bruce Laingen and Victor Tomseth. I was able to call and because I could speak
                    Farsi I got through the secretaries. I was able to establish a direct telephone
                    contact with Bruce and Victor, the first one. It became institutionalized but I
                    saved some days, and weeks, who knows. I was able to contact Iranian friends in
                    the vicinity of the embassy by a direct phone call and get information about
                    what was happening during a time when rumors were rife. I was able for example
                    to make calls after the aborted rescue mission, Carter's rescue attempt.</p>
                <p>The State Department asked me to go out and speak to organizations. I remember I
                    spoke to the National Association of Editors which are basically editors of
                    small town newspapers but they gathered in one of the square states, I think it
                    was Colorado but I'm not sure. They were very interested in speaking to me. I
                    felt that I was made use of, but not at Harvard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting. Did this thing stir up any emotion at
                        Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Not to my knowledge. At the same time I was asked to go up the street
                    to Tufts at the Fletcher School and lead a seminar on the Iranian Revolution.
                    When I came back to D.C. I was asked to lead seminars at the University of
                    Maryland and at American University. But at Harvard, first their focus was very
                    much first world. It was the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Global diplomacy and
                    what was going on in Iran just didn't seem that important I think. Second they
                    were trying to do something for the ages. Everything was at a level of theory
                    and abstraction that made today's headlines not irrelevant but less relevant.
                    They were only relevant as illustrations of the kinds of things that could
                    happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your course was what? Or courses? Was this public
                        administration and what do you mean by that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: It was a wonderful year. The State Department considered it a
                    sabbatical year to do whatever I liked. There were no requirements and not even
                    any encouragement to go for a degree. I was to go and study and refresh my
                    mental capacity. I chose to go for a degree and I found that the requirements
                    were almost infinitely flexible. I ended up taking 85 percent of my courses at
                    the Sloane School at MIT studying systems analysis. Sloane is the school of the
                    people who invented systems dynamics so I studied with people like Nat Mass and
                    others. At Harvard I sat in on the weekly seminars and I participated in the
                    two, I think, required courses. I got good enough marks out of MIT to satisfy
                    Harvard and Harvard awarded me the degree when I had accumulated sufficient
                    credits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With systems analysis, what did you see that leading
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: My dream at the time did not come to fruition but what I hoped to do
                    was to find a way of capturing the knowledge and awareness of how things work
                    for Foreign Service officers who flow through the system. What happens typically
                    is you go to a country for four years. In the first six months you have complete
                    ignorance, the next year and a half you are ignorant but you know enough so you
                    can fake it. Towards the end of your tour you begin to understand how the
                    factions interrelate, who has power, what is important in this culture and this
                    society, and then you leave often with no overlap. What I was looking for was
                    using systems analysis and systems dynamics which talks about inputs and
                    outputs, and weights and measures, to have a structure so that somebody in a
                    position could record, before they leave, their knowledge such that you could do
                    readings saying if this happens it flows through the system and this is a likely
                    outcome. This would be left for the successor who changes it, who comments on
                    it, adds to it, subtracts from it, tries things, finds out it doesn't work. Over
                    time this accumulated analysis of what the system is in country x, becomes a
                    fairly good predictive tool.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>I did the beginnings of the work at MIT, brought it back and while I was in
                    Washington I worked with the CIA, DIA, and INR analysts trying to construct it.
                    I understand, though I don't know that, that the CIA actually tried to put it
                    into practice and it may still be there, something like this. By the end I was
                    one of many contributors to something that had gone far beyond my ideas but the
                    State Department never was interested. They saw it as something having to do
                    with computers and therefore having to do with GSO [General Services Officer]
                    kind of work, not the work of real people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in the summer of '80 was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: In September of '80.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Actually I left in May of '80 and I then went back up to finish things.
                    I got a call from John Sprott at FSI who said that they felt that they needed
                    somebody to teach political analysis and that when he'd been hearing about who
                    was doing what, my name kept coming up. He read what I had written on Iran and
                    felt that I was doing more analytical work than a lot of people in the Foreign
                    Service, rather than descriptive. He asked if I would be willing to come and
                    teach political analysis. I said yes, when I finished. I kept on talking to FSI,
                    kept coming up. I came up for one short course and went back. At the same time
                    the idea of a mid level graduate refresher for all FSO's was being born so I got
                    hauled into the planning for that and ended up drafting the FSI proposal for a
                    mid level course. It came up originally as deputy coordinator political studies
                    with responsibility for this planning, and then coordinator political studies
                    and initially of the mid level program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you associated with the FSI, sort of as a

                <p>McGAFFEY: It was four years.</p>

                        much. What was your feeling about the role of the FSI as seen by the Foreign
                        Service in general? Not what it should be, but how did you see the FSI

                <p>McGAFFEY: When I was first approached to join FSI I was somewhat reluctant
                    because other than its reputation as one of the two best language schools in the
                    world, I had the feeling that it was largely a backwater. The more I talked to
                    the people who were there, the more I got the idea that it didn't need to be and
                    that this was an opportunity to put training in an appropriate place in the
                    Foreign Service. I think that if the mid level course I did had not existed, I
                    probably would not have accepted the assignment but I know that for myself,
                    personally, the year at Harvard had been a wonderful rebuilding experience. I
                    had gotten so involved in operations and drafting that my mind had fallen into
                    ruts and at Harvard I was forced to think about how I was thinking and what I
                    was thinking. I saw too many FSOs who came in with a good education, broadly
                    defined, with open minds, and then as the years went by and they stayed in the
                    same type of job and the same area, they got narrower, and narrower, and
                    narrower to the point where they were not able to respond to all of the changes.
                    So I signed on to help revitalize FSI as a means of revitalizing the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have been interviewing Howard Sollenberger who was very
                        much with the FSI up until about '76 I think, from the '40s up, and he
                        talked about trying to put in an equivalent to a mid career course and how
                        it didn't work. At one time there was this ad hoc organization called the
                        young Turks. Here I am gray hair with beard, but I was a young Turk in those
                        days and I was on the training committee that was trying to figure out a
                        training program. We figured out the idea of a training program including
                        all the good things. Then we started toting up how long it would take
                        including languages and all. A person would have to train his or her entire
                        career when you start adding on what you want. This is time out and people
                        are paid solid salaries during this time. How was this going to fit into the
                        system as far as value received?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: We spent a lot of time analyzing exactly that issue. We looked at other
                    foreign diplomatic services, we looked at banks, insurance companies, law firms,
                    and the Supreme Court. We looked at a lot of different institutions and found
                    that medicine made perhaps the best analogy and concluded that to be really
                    effective, an FSO should plan on spending almost a third of their career in
                    training. We were able to show by analogy at least, to the satisfaction of both
                    the State Department at all levels and OMB [Office of Management and Budget],
                    that at least a portion of that would have money benefit, that the money spent
                    would be worth it. Languages are an essential part of it and need to be
                    continuing, need to be ongoing. Initial training is important but what we were
                    showing was that the State Department was actually investing a great deal of
                    money in initial training, a good deal of money in senior training, and nothing
                    in between. The personnel system admitted that the criteria it had for admission
                    to the senior levels was riddled with exceptions and was not being met because
                    people did not have either the breath of experience or the training to meet
                    those criteria.</p>
                <p>We persuaded them to go for a mid level course which would be the equivalent of a
                    masters degree or more, certainly graduate level, that would be for mid level
                    officers. We negotiated for almost a year and got the criteria for admission to
                    the mid level program accepted and got the money matters settled. It was
                    designed for people who were roughly in their fourth or fifth tour in the
                    Foreign Service and had been off probation for at least two tours. They had
                    served overseas and in Washington, with at least one tour in their specialty and
                    at least one tour in some other specialty. They had a solid understanding of who
                    they were and what the Foreign Service was. This was designed to provide them
                    with the tools so that they could take that and move forward into the senior
                    levels.</p>
                <p>We put it in and the system fought back, the system resisted. People did not want
                    to be assigned for six months to FSI for both practical reasons and
                    philosophical reasons. The practical reason was that the assignment system was
                    designed around an annual cycle and six months put you outside of the cycle and
                    there are not many jobs open. The philosophical reason is that people thought
                    that fast track people could not afford to take any time off. If they were ever
                    out of the leading edge job, they would no longer be on the fast track so the
                    best people for whom this was designed, did not want to come. We finally got the
                    Foreign Service to make it a requirement to enter the senior levels, another one
                    of these threshold criteria. We got the personnel system to assign people willy
                    nilly and I think we built an excellent program.</p>
                <p>One of the things that gratifies me these days is that I keep running into
                    Ambassador so and so who says “You probably don't remember me but I was in your
                    mid level course back in 1980. I hated it and I used to complain to you and
                    about you all of the time. You know what, I found that it's really useful. I
                    have been using it every day since then.” That was not an untypical reaction
                    when the people finished the course. They started very reluctantly, they got
                    involved and they felt that they really had added something.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Then we were victim to some large extent, of our own success. The more people
                    said it was successful, the more people volunteered to go in and every single
                    mid level class (we only it for the four years) had more people in it. It was
                    designed for a cycle of three a year with 17 people in the class and we thought
                    that we would eventually have two classes with 17 each adding more faculty, etc.
                    We never got any more operational money but by the time that I left, there were
                    90 people in the class and something that worked very effectively in the seminar
                    setting with 17 people was not as successful with 90 people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Too much lecturing and not enough participation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Yes, it became talking heads and lecturing, and very little action. How
                    do you get exercises where people actually carry out these things when you have
                    90 people? People were complaining bitterly and I agreed with them but since
                    they gave me no more staff, that was half of the problem. The other half was
                    that as more and more people were being pushed in, the personnel system was
                    deviating more and more from the criteria. Increasingly, of these 90 people
                    perhaps one third met the criteria and two thirds were people who had finished
                    their first tour and some people were just out of entry level training for whom
                    there was not an immediate obvious job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it became sort of a parking place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: No, part of it was that it was our mistake. We made it a checklist, a
                    punch card criterion for entering the senior Foreign Service. Everybody wants to
                    get their cards punched as early as possible so any time there was an
                    opportunity, people said let me take that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you did this there are various permutations but
                        essentially we have four different specialties: political, economic,
                        consular, administrative. With these courses was there a desire to get
                        people from the various things to look at it as executives, that they are
                        going to go beyond that, or was this essentially originally designed for
                        political and economic officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: That was one of the conditions that I placed on getting involved
                    myself. I've never liked the cone system. I entered before it began. I was
                    labeled a political officer. But I was the first political officer to get
                    admitted to the 26 week economics course because I felt that I can't do
                    political work without an understanding of economics and vice versa. I did
                    political reporting as a consular officer. I wanted to be a principal officer in
                    a small post which meant that I had to understand the administrative side. If
                    you are going to enter the senior Foreign Service, you have to understand
                    everything.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>So it was at least partly subversive, an attempt to undermine the cone system,
                    that we insisted that equal numbers from all of the four cones be admitted to
                    every class and we deliberately mixed them. There was no grouping of political
                    officers, economic officers. It was another area of resistance. When we started
                    talking about political analysis the admin types sat back and said this is not
                    for me. We spent a lot of the time persuading them. Sometimes the political
                    types sat back and said this is my field, I know all of this.</p>
                <p>Negotiations was one area of greatest success. When I came to FSI there was a
                    negotiations course and it consisted of war stories. Old FSOs, often retired
                    FSOs who had been present at major negotiation events, came in and talked about
                    how good they were and people who had nothing better to do took notes. I had
                    participated in the birth of the Harvard negotiation project while I was at
                    Harvard. This was an area of my particular interests so I developed an entirely
                    new course which is still going on. It was one of the survivors of the mid level
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you craft that one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: First I divided it into three equal segments. One was exercises,
                    simulations, actual negotiations that the student had to carry out. Second was
                    war stories, people talking about what they had done but only after people had
                    gone through theory and practice, and could question them. The third was theory
                    of negotiations drawing in some of the best practitioners and theoreticians from
                    the academic world, the business world and elsewhere. I ended up with my
                    principal teacher being a man named Tom Colosi from the American Arbitration
                    Association. Another major teacher was Bill Zartman from SAIS [School of
                    Advanced International Studies] who had been working on Rhodesia's negotiation
                    for independence and for 15 years worked on South Africa, a practitioner and a
                    theoretician. We presented the theory of negotiations, we forced them to
                    actually negotiate in simulations, and then we brought in people like Diego
                    Asencio to talk about negotiation under extreme conditions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain the conditions he was negotiating
                        under?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: We explained to him what he was coming into, and we explained to the
                    students that this is a case study, this is not an ambassador, this is not
                    somebody to be respectful for, this is somebody to examine and to pull lessons
                    out of. We brought him in and said you've got people pointing guns at you,
                    threatening to kill you, what happens? How do you go from that position to
                    negotiating a successful resolution? Many of the practitioners really had no
                    idea. They knew what they had done but they didn't know why some things had
                    worked and why other things had not worked. The students became experts at
                    ferreting this out and seeing why some things worked. We brought in as many
                    failures as successes. The students applied what they had learned in the theory
                    and the practice to the...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In some of my interviews we've talked about people saying
                        that they've sort of analyzed what is the American style of negotiations as
                        seen by other countries. Several of the things are one, the negotiators are
                        generally well informed or they have a lot of information at their hand, but
                        a great impatience and a certain amount of arrogance. Unwillingness but on
                        the other hand a willingness to listen and to come to a deal. Were you able
                        to look at American style negotiations and to let people understand how
                        others were perceiving them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: We did quite a bit on that and that's an area, while successful, which
                    needed a lot more work. As a matter of fact I've been doing a lot more work on
                    that ever since this experience. Yes, we had Japanese analyses of American
                    negotiating style, German analyses of American negotiating style. We looked at
                    cultural visions of reality. There was a major dispute that broke out in this
                    period after Bruce Laingen wrote an article that talked about negotiating with
                    Iranians. A man named Said, an academic, wrote a vicious attack on Laingen
                    saying that this is an arrogant colonial white man looking down on Iranians. We
                    put the Said article and the Laingen article side by side and brought in
                    Iranians and people who had dealt with Iranians. We concluded finally that
                    Laingen had made a few unfortunate choices of words but that his analysis of how
                    Iranians approach a negotiation was very accurate and that Said was responding
                    to the words and not the content and that Said just did not understand how
                    Americans look at a negotiating context. It proved to be useful but there is
                    very little practical information about cultural differences, information that
                    you can use in an analytical sense. There is a lot of descriptive and a lot of
                    prescriptive such as saying people stand so many inches apart, but analytical
                    information is low in availability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the difference between when you say analytical and
                        descriptive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Descriptive is strictly surface. You know you've described something
                    and it is accurate and you have no foundation for knowing why it is so, what
                    difference it makes. Analytical information tries to, and again it's systems
                    analysis, break things down to its components and show how the various
                    influences work to result in this behavior. Given a new area for which there is
                    no description, you have enough understanding of the system, of the different
                    values and how they interact, for example the history and the orientation, so
                    that you can predict with some expectation of accuracy what the behavior will be
                    in this new situation. You can understand areas of sensitivity even if you can't
                    predict, you can be alert for unhappiness.</p>

                        of come up with models, information, dealing with various parts of the

                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: My idea at that time was very much involved in my studies of systems
                    dynamics. If we could take from the experience of people who have lived in,
                    studied and interacted with these meaningful bits of information rather than a
                    summing up which glosses over and gives an accurate image but no depth. If we
                    could extract meaningful items of information about these different cultures, we
                    begin to have a structure that we can add on to, add information to, so that
                    over time a meaningful, analytical structure exists.</p>

                        couple of tours in other countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Again this was one of the reasons I was so conscious of the
                    deterioration of the standards by the personnel system. Originally that was
                    true. The seminars where people would compare and contrast their experience, and
                    try to look for meaning were very valuable and former students from the early
                    classes have commented to me how valuable it was. In later classes, first most
                    of the students had not had overseas experience or if they had it was in a visa
                    mill someplace where the only contact they had with locals was a 3.7 minute
                    interview with a supervisor saying “remember they are lying.” We used excerpts
                    from the first classes in what we fed to the mobs in the later classes and
                    people took it in but again it is a talking head situation and the loss of
                    information in that is tremendous. Again students from the earlier classes have
                    continued to apply that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there several directors of the Foreign Service
                        Institute while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: No there was one, Steve Low.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a point of his interests, he just retired but he was
                        the head of this organization which is now doing this and he seems to be the
                        spark plug behind many developments. How was he dealing with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Initially my image of him was as depending a great deal on John Sprott.
                    He kept himself outside of the early developmental fights. John was the head of
                    professional studies. When we, within professional studies, had fought our
                    fights and had reached an agreement, then we took it to Steve Low and Steve then
                    led the fight with the Department and with OMB and was very effective. He
                    questioned us deeply, he had to be convinced. Once he bought on, he was a
                    consummate bureaucratic politician.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>For example a friend of mine working for DIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, was
                    working in a building on this location and told me over dinner that he had just
                    been informed that they were moving out of this location because it was old and
                    that the Pentagon was planning to donate this site to the county of Arlington.
                    One of the problems we were facing at FSI, which was at that time in I think 11
                    different buildings all in Rosslyn, was chopped up space and not enough space. I
                    took that bit of information to Steve Low and the result is that we now have FSI
                    housed in the NFATC [National Foreign Affairs Training Center] in one of the
                    best facilities in the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the National Foreign Affairs Training
                        Center located at the old military place called Arlington Hall which was a
                        decoding intelligence agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Before then it had been a girls school. It is central and it's
                    spacious. It's a great facility but it cost millions of dollars and it required
                    intense working overtime at the highest levels and that is what Steve Low
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there battles with Personnel? Was Personnel basically
                        in charge of who went? Were there battles to try to get personnel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: There were battles with every class and essentially we lost. I did an
                    analysis once for Steve Low pointing out that the problem was timing. By the
                    time that we got a list of names proposed for the course, we had to approve them
                    in theory, the list of names arrived at the end of the assignment cycle and any
                    person that we said no to, had no job. In fight after fight where we felt that
                    somebody was not appropriate, the response was “We have nothing else for them.
                    Won't you please, just this once, take them and we will do better next time?”
                    Because it was true that they had no place else to send them, we ended up
                    accepting them, and shouldn't have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little bit about, as it developed, the
                        content of the course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: There were two parallel streams. One was a list of skills that we kept
                    refining that we wanted them to have: skills in negotiation, bureaucratic
                    politics, science and technology, and writing, and formal skills in analytical
                    methodology. We worked on those and found for example that they needed more math
                    to do the analytical methods and for the science and technology. We brought in a
                    wonderful mathematician from the University of Maryland who unfortunately in the
                    second year won one of those MacArthur grants. He said he was going to go off
                    and write some books and didn't have any time for teaching, sorry about that,
                    David.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>We kept focusing on what specific skills they needed and overlaid on that.
                    Justifying the order of classes and the fill ins and everything else was an
                    integrating function. A realization that there is a single Foreign Service and
                    that to be in the senior Foreign Service you had to ignore the cones and focus
                    on it. A need for management at the senior levels, so management policy
                    planning, strategic thinking, and exposure to the principal thinkers in the
                    academic world on matters that touched on the Foreign Service. What are the
                    issues for the next 50 years? What is happening in development economics? The
                    change from the idea of give and they will develop automatically, to focus on
                    capital development and ignore everything else, to focus on market distribution
                    and ignore everything else. Why have the theories taken these different
                    positions, so that people begin to have an understanding so they can lead with
                    appreciation of what somebody was saying.</p>
                <p>We had a series of classes that were narrow focused skills with a lot of
                    exercises, a lot of simulations, a lot of role playing, a lot of carrying out.
                    Then we had seminars with a heavy reading lists and interesting speakers so
                    people could talk about the ideas moving toward this idea of the interests of
                    the United States and how to promote them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there similar courses in the academic world? I am
                        interested in interrelationship of the FSI and what you were doing in the
                        academic world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Not similar courses to the extent that we could just reach out and
                    borrow. The closest equivalent, and it was in fact fairly close, was the various
                    war colleges. They had much more of an emphasis on military science and strategy
                    in terms of military strategies but the general concept was similar and so we
                    borrowed from them.</p>
                <p>We ended up with an advisory board of 45 academics from all over the U.S. as a
                    matter of fact, from North Carolina, Ohio, Wisconsin, Berkeley, University of
                    Texas. Probably 30 of the 45 were from area universities, American University,
                    University of Maryland, Georgetown, George Mason, and the like. This board met
                    quarterly and usually about 30 of the 45 would manage to show up. We would lay
                    out what we were trying to do and where we were trying to go. Sometimes their
                    advice was as simple as giving us the name of an article saying “This is
                    something that your students should be reading.” “This is a teacher who you
                    should be in touch with.” “This is a text.” But more importantly it was a group
                    that we could invite people from personnel to, people from the seventh floor of
                    the State Department to, Steve Low to, to talk about what we're trying to
                    accomplish and what value it is.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>The essential criteria for being on the board was that FSI invited them because
                    we were impressed. We heard the name and thought they had something to
                    contribute. They had no unified point of view. They were all people who were
                    aware that the world existed outside the borders of the United States but not
                    all of them were internationalists by any means. They were intense thinking
                    individuals who thought that this was a worthwhile effort and wanted to make it
                    better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see any interest from some of the other
                        professional foreign services, British, German, French, Brazilian, Japanese,
                        or anyone else, in what we were doing or was everybody doing their own
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: The British, French and Canadians sent observers which indicates a
                    fairly high level of interest because they were spending money. The really
                    intense interest was in the foreign services in the third world who had no
                    training program at all. One of Steve Low's ideas during this period was to
                    transform FSI from being the training institution for the U.S. Foreign Service
                    to being THE premier diplomatic training institution for the world. If my memory
                    serves me, we managed to get one group of diplomats from I believe Africa. I
                    just can't remember. We had a lot of people coming and talking to us but I think
                    there was only one group that actually got assigned to a class and went through
                    a full course. State Department was not particularly interested in this idea. It
                    was one of those things that everybody nodded and said wouldn't that be
                    interesting but nobody was willing to go out on a limb for. Some people who
                    didn't have a good theoretical understanding of negotiation and were still
                    thinking of it as us versus them, said “Gee, if we train these guys to be
                    negotiators and then they have to negotiate with us, they'll get something out
                    of this that they wouldn't otherwise and that will be bad.” It was something
                    that we talked about, we did a lot of work on, we wrote about, we invited
                    observers and while I was here at least, it just never got off stage one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there any other subject we should talk about of this
                        '80 to '84 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: I was at least partially involved in a lot of changes. Much of this is
                    Steve Low and he is the person you should be talking to about it. During this
                    same period we started new ambassadors and DCMs courses and changed drastically
                    the senior seminar. Again we were taking the principals developed for the mid
                    level program and reapplying them with changes for the senior levels. We changed
                    the economics course away from being a course for economists and econometricians
                    to being a course in the economics of international relations put in fairly high
                    level political economy rather than just econometrics. We developed Con Gen
                    Rosslyn with again the same sort of principles: practice, application, uses of
                    material, not just lectures. People had to visit Americans in jail with role
                    playing. They had to do what consular officers do. We changed the course for
                    Foreign Service secretaries. The thinking about the mid level course was the
                    theoretical engine for changes in the way that training was approached
                    throughout.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Up until this time the school of languages and the school of area studies had
                    been two separate schools. Partly because of the kind of inputs from this group
                    of academics, we moved toward integrating them. I believe that now they are a
                    single school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it is a single school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Because the idea that you can learn a language and have no need of
                    understanding the history, the culture, the context of the language, didn't seem
                    to work and how do you understand the context without something of the language.
                    So we moved them toward integration. It was a time of real excitement at
                    FSI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go in '84?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: It was a strange situation. I got a call from the head of VOA [Voice of
                    America] asking if I would be willing to come over and work with their NANESA
                    division, that is North Africa Near East and South Asia. That's an out of
                    everything tour from an FSO and I wanted to know why he called me. He called on
                    the recommendation of Ed Meinland who had been my predecessor as coordinator of
                    political studies at FSI. They had a situation in that division, literally, that
                    had two stabbings with one staff member stabbed by another staff member on two
                    different occasions down in the warrens. They had broadcasts booths, probably 12
                    would fit into this room.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about a room of about 20 feet by 15 or
                        something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: They were basically one person booths with little alleys, all dim so
                    that people could concentrate, and two people had been stabbed. They had intense
                    jealousies and they had people at each throats. They wanted somebody who
                    understood something of the culture of that area and understood something of
                    management, rather than a radio expert. I knew nothing about radio. I had
                    managed a DJ program in college for a year. They asked me to come over on a
                    temporary basis to figure out what they could do to prevent this whole division
                    from collapsing.</p>
                <p>I studied it carefully before agreeing and I finally agreed with my heart in my
                    mouth because they had a lot of strikes against them. In this division they had
                    Arabs and Israelis, Greeks and Turks. They had in a single Iranian service with
                    an old group that had been recruited when the Shah was in power and were Shah
                    supporters, and a group of young Turks who were Khomeini types. They had the
                    Pakistanis and the Indians. They had almost half of the standard cultural and
                    ethnic conflicts in the world housed in this one division.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>On top of that they had a policy of going to the countries and recruiting the
                    very top people in radio and television services of those countries. Egos and
                    their association with show business are not different in other countries so
                    these were people who were used to being treated as stars. They came in and
                    every single one were at the same level because they were paid top dollar which
                    meant that once they got here, not only was everybody else paid at the same
                    level, there was no basis for claiming stardom, but there was no possibility of
                    promotion. No matter how long they stayed, they were stuck because they had been
                    hired at the top level.</p>
                <p>VOA brought in all of these egos, crammed them into inadequate quarters to
                    broadcast 42 hours a day, obviously with overlap, to one of the most important
                    regions in the world that ranged from Marrakech to Bangladesh. They were
                    directed by somebody who had been in radio for 32 years, knew all about radio,
                    and had never been outside of Washington. For some reason they were having
                    difficulties. I finally did accept.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because we are talking also about the profession, in 1979
                        you go to Harvard, you to go to the FSI until '84, and now you are going to
                        Voice of America. This is not the ladder towards moving up and becoming an
                        ambassador or something like that within the Foreign Service. You must have
                        been making your choices by your heart rather than sort of the career
                        principle.</hi>

                <p>McGAFFEY: I was. I told you I disliked the cone system. I never accepted the fact
                    that I was labeled a political officer. I had concluded that the personnel
                    system was irrelevant in terms of ultimate success, and that success was
                    basically a matter of who you knew and who you impressed. When I had worked in
                    the operations center I got an offer of a job with U. Alexis Johnson. He told me
                    that he wanted somebody to be on tap 20 hours a day and that I should say good
                    bye to my wife and children. I knew that that would be a good way to get a
                    promotion, and I said no. I had been making choices with my heart but on the
                    other hand I also had the feeling that if I did an impressive job, I might
                    impress somebody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were with the Voice of America starting in '84 until
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: '84 to '86. I was there just about two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about as you saw the structure of
                        USIA and Voice of America as the new boy on the block, how it fit
                        together?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Perhaps the most important thing is that neither USIA nor Voice of
                    America took the relationship very seriously. The Voice of America was very
                    visible in the White House and in Congress. Its money was largely based on
                    things like the level of anti communism. Its most prominent features were the
                    old Radio Free Europe and the brand new, what was the anti Castro one?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Radio Marti. We are talking about the high Reagan
                        administration</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: The high Reagan administration. They had largely eliminated most USIA
                    Foreign Service officers from VOA. They had an outside director, an outside
                    deputy director, and most of the senior staff were radio people and they saw
                    themselves as radio people. They had an institutional connection to USIA which
                    was perhaps similar to the attitude within the Arms Control and Disarmament
                    Agency to the State Department. Yes, there is a connection. My boss goes over to
                    see the secretary once a month but that is it. There was not a lot of
                    connection.</p>
                <p>Secondly the big debate within VOA was the political debate. There were those who
                    saw its function as being the propaganda voice of the United States. These
                    people were probably more conservative and more anti communist than anything
                    else but their idea was to spread U.S. values, interests, and policy
                    information, and be persuasive. There was a larger, usually somewhat smaller
                    rank but more operational group, who saw that its role was to be the best
                    international radio service in the world. That it must be objective, it must be
                    realistic, it had to out BBC, BBC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The BBC was sort of your target?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Yes, it was put forward as the image to beat all of the time. By those
                    who wanted us to be more propagandistic it was the image of what we should not
                    do. For those who felt we should be an international radio, it was what we
                    should be doing. This was important because there was a lot of money at the
                    time. We were building transmitters everywhere and adding new divisions. We were
                    adding a television division, adding new equipment. When Reagan came in VOA was
                    still using equipment that had been put in under Truman. It was actually in the
                    Carter regime that they got the money for it but they installed the new
                    equipment under Reagan and very much saw itself as a growth organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you accepted by these radio men? Was it they had
                        too much blood on the floor, they needed somebody? How did they feel about
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: The radio men largely ignored me. I headed my own division, on an
                    acting basis by the way. I was not formally there and I made it very clear that
                    I was not tenured, I was not there for the long term. Everybody was concerned
                    about their division. I met other division directors very rarely. I had a good
                    understanding with the director of VOA. The people I had problems with were the
                    technical radio people who felt that any demands that I made would vanish with
                    me and therefore they shouldn't change their operation to do it. I had intense
                    squabbles with things like scheduling and obtaining certain frequencies for my
                    people's broadcasts. But the division people, the people in the NANESA division,
                    were expert radio people. They were the experts in both content and the
                    technical side so they gave me all the ammunition I needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go? You got this disparate, which is a mild
                        word, group that you had to deal with with all these rivalries that go back
                        unto the first generation or something like that. How did you deal with this
                        coming from your background, having dealt with systems analysis, your mid
                        career course and all theory and all of a sudden you are faced with probably
                        THE mother of all problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: My area background helped. I speak Farsi and Dari so I was able to talk
                    to those people in their own language. I speak a little bit of Urdu and
                    Hindustani, enough to be polite, and fragments of Arabic, some Turkish and some
                    Greek. I started out by showing that I was interested in them, not in radio. I
                    exposed my ignorance wide open and I said “I am here to see if there is any way
                    for you to shine. For you to show that you are the best people around.”
                    Basically I did a thousand and one things. Some worked and some didn't.</p>
                <p>The basic thing that I did is I shifted competition away from money, because
                    there couldn't be any, rank because there couldn't be any, kind of class because
                    there couldn't be any, toward creative competition in terms of broadcast
                    content. VOA gave 24 awards a year for the best news program, the best sports
                    program, the best this, that and the other thing. I managed to get these people
                    to start thinking about the fact that they are highly qualified, highly
                    experienced. I said “These (and I would name some other division) people were
                    still banging rocks together when you were first on the radio, how come they are
                    winning awards and you are not?” In my second year there, the NANESA division
                    won 22 of the 24 awards. I managed to get them thinking about competing on the
                    basis of quality.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>I got the group of young Turk Iranians and I said “You're saying that these other
                    Iranians are a bunch of old fogies and that you are better than they are. Prove
                    it. I will give you a segment. Give me a show that will win the awards that will
                    get the response.” I said to the older ones, “You say that these punk kids don't
                    even know which end of the radio to speak into. Prove it. Give me a show that is
                    better than theirs.” These two groups started competing with each other on the
                    basis of radio performance. One of the effects was that even though they
                    continued to disagree politically, they had to recognize the real quality of the
                    people they were facing. They got to admire each other professionally even if
                    they disliked each others politics. Somehow that kind of competition, even
                    though it is still competition, did not lead to the intense jealousies and anger
                    that led to the stabbings.</p>
                <p>I brought in a few new people to head country divisions, people who I had made
                    contact with through FSI. Again for the Iranian division I brought in somebody
                    who's an Iranian expert, not a radio expert. I said these people have all the
                    radio expertise you'll ever need. What do you need an American radio expert for?
                    Bring in somebody who knows Iran and who can work with them on what to broadcast
                    to the Iranian people so the Iranian people want to listen to VOA. I managed to
                    turn it around and it was very interesting.</p>
                <p>There was something else going on at the same time which also responds to your
                    earlier question of why VOA. While I was in Iran, I think we discussed this, I
                    got very badly messed up by a mob which included both of my knee caps being
                    smashed. During this period I was essentially a cripple. My knees would give out
                    on an unexpected basis and I would fall flat on my face if I wasn't holding onto
                    something so I could not go overseas. I did not particularly like the idea of
                    the halls of State Department and was trying to face up to the idea of whether I
                    was going to live the rest of my life as a cripple.</p>
                <p>My departure from VOA was one of those things that, things come together in time
                    whether it was expected or not. I had an operation on my knees which resulted in
                    pulmonary embolism and I lost a lung. Toward the end of my second year I was
                    only being part time there. A new director of VOA came in. He wanted to bring in
                    somebody from USIA (again things were changing in the politics) and didn't know
                    quite what to do with me because I had been very successful but I was standing
                    in the way of his bringing in the person he wanted. Once I understood what was
                    happening, I went to him and said my health does not allow me and I am going to
                    have to sit it out for a while until I can retrain my one lung to take the place
                    of two. So I left with banquet and joy all around and it was a relief both to
                    him and to me. It was a fascinating interlude that was outside of my
                    normal...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you are dealing with THE hot spot of the times where
                        Americans were very much concerned, the Cold War was still very much in
                        existence, and you have the Reagan administration which had taken a very
                        strong anti Soviet, anti communist stance. Did you find that your knowledge
                        of the area that you were dealing with, did the right wing emphasis of the
                        Reagan administration intrude on your work at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: It intruded at least once in a very amusing way. I got a call from a
                    man that I had never heard of before. He said that he had just been named as
                    ambassador to Belize and he wondered if I would consider being his DCM. I said I
                    would be glad to consider it, let me find out what is happening. I finally found
                    out that he was a former aide of Senator Jesse Helms who had been named as an
                    ambassador in one of these exchanges. He had gotten my name from Jesse. He had
                    gotten my name because Jesse had sent his people down to VOA to find out what
                    were the politics of this stranger in a very sensitive area. They talked to the
                    Afghan members of my staff, who said “Oh, Mr. McGaffey really hates communists.
                    He is a strong anti communist fighter for the freedom of Afghanistan.” It is
                    true, I was a fighter for the freedom for Afghanistan. I would have been a
                    fighter if they had been invaded by the Pakistanis as well.</p>
                <p>What happened was I personally had been very careful in VOA to try to keep my own
                    political views, which are generally liberal progressive, out of it. I was there
                    as a management expert trying to let those people do their job. I did feel
                    strongly about Afghanistan. I felt that the people of Afghanistan felt strongly
                    about it so I encouraged the Afghan staff to be very forthright in what they
                    were saying about the Soviet invasion. That got interpreted through the
                    investigation as I'm a hard right winger and so I was asked to be the DCM for an
                    up and coming young right wing ambassador. As it happened, I got posted as DCM
                    to Belize but Jesse Helms chose that moment to refuse to consider the
                    nominations of some half dozen people and the State Department, (by coincidence
                    I am sure, it could not have been retaliation) never managed to forward the name
                    of this ambassador for consideration. So he sat in a tiny little office in old
                    State waiting to have his name forwarded while I was on sick leave recovering
                    from my bad lung.</p>
                <p>Then my name got put forward as DCM for another position in the Caribbean. Again
                    it's who knows you and who is impressed. Presumably my name had come to their
                    attention because I was on the list for DCM. There was an ambassador in another
                    country who was an excellent ambassador but the Department was dissatisfied with
                    the reporting from the post, not his reporting but the reporting program. The
                    man in charge of that was one of my students from FSI who knew that I knew what
                    there was to know about reporting and so he suggested my name to him. So this
                    other ambassador called me up and said “Would you like to be my DCM in
                    Georgetown Guyana?” So I went to the first man and said I have another offer and
                    since there seems to be some uncertainty about your position, I think I will
                    accept it if you don't mind. He was quite gracious about it. I was named as DCM
                    for Georgetown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Georgetown and were there from '86 was
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Yes, from '86 to '90. It turned out that I did not go as DCM. When I
                    arrived the ambassador said that he had just been asked to come in and head one
                    of the selection panels and following that he was to head a study for the board
                    of the Foreign Service. After about one month I was going to be charg� and the
                    end of his tour was coming so he didn't expect that he would be back. Later
                    after he got to know me a little better, he explained to me that there was a
                    political underlying thing. He had been named as ambassador to the Guyana of the
                    president for life Burnham who was fairly strongly anti American, isolationist,
                    leftist. He had been successful but had a very difficult time and Burnham had
                    just died. The State Department was not willing to name another ambassador until
                    they saw which way this country was going to turn and was rather happy to have
                    no ambassador at all. They pulled him out, not formally, and had no intention of
                    naming another ambassador for the near term at least.</p>
                <p>I went from VOA essentially to be charg� in Georgetown with a whole embassy under
                    my care and a difficult personal situation. My wife had just joined the Foreign
                    Service and I had requested that she be assigned to Georgetown as a junior vice
                    consul. They said “No, that is not possible, nepotism and all. But we will
                    assign her to the next country over. It is only about an hour away, in
                    Trinidad.” Then when I became charg�, first I found out that a trip to Trinidad
                    was essentially 24 hour travel time. The two airports were neither accessible.
                    There were not many flights and you had to be there well in advance. By the time
                    you went round trip it was 24 hours. I had to really schedule things to see my
                    wife.</p>
                <p>Second I found that as charg�, I had to get permission from the State Department
                    to leave the country which was not easily forthcoming. I also found that the
                    ambassador in Trinidad was not terribly delighted by the situation because if I
                    arrive as the principal officer of an embassy, there is a certain protocol for
                    dealing with me, for example dining with the ambassador, and perhaps be invited
                    to stay at his house. There is a very different protocol for dealing with the
                    most junior vice consul on his large embassy staff. Since we were married to
                    each other there was some uncertainty about how he should deal with us. She came
                    to Guyana a few times and I went to Trinidad a few times but mostly when we
                    could get away we absconded to Venezuela and had our weekends in Venezuela.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought the Trinidad thing could have been
                        worked out with the ambassador. Was he sort of a stickler for things and not
                        very flexible?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: It was only a matter of discomfort, there were no obstacles. I was
                    aware of the discomfort and most of the discomfort was on the part of other
                    people. The ambassador's secretary was horrified by this. The consul was not as
                    particularly upset. It was more the middle levels.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in 1986 in Georgetown what was the
                        situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Burnham had just died. He had been in the practice of rotating his vice
                    presidents. He had people in for about four to six months and then would get
                    somebody else from the cabinet, from the party, explicitly to prevent anybody
                    from having a power base. There was a man, a former minister of finance, who was
                    vice president at the time of his death, who perforce, became president. He was
                    a man who had no particular strength in the party. Nobody had strength in the
                    party because it was Burnham and then everybody else. It was very deliberate
                    policy, very similar to the Shah's policy. He had no particular strength, he was
                    a bureaucrat, a technocrat. He was an acceptably competent finance minister and
                    suddenly he is president. He headed a minority party.</p>
                <p>Politics in Guyana was racial, and still is, and every president denies it. He
                    headed the black, the Afro, party which was an urban party heavily concentrated
                    in government. A devote Stalinist style communist headed the opposition party,
                    the Indo [East Indian] party, based on the very militant union of sugar workers,
                    sugarcane cutters. They had been out of power since Burnham came in, since
                    independence. The Indian origin population was the majority, and except for the
                    sugarcane cutters, was basically middle class and dominated small shops,
                    professions, teaching. They were very much not communist, not Stalinist, but
                    Cheddi Jagan was the symbol of opposition so all of the Indo Guyanese supported
                    the party of Cheddi Jagan even though they didn't support his politics.</p>
                <p>This new president was trying to figure out what to do with a country that had no
                    experience with politics and what to do with himself and his party. There was a
                    third party that had tried to get started on a non racial basis and was
                    dismissed as the party of the “Douglas”, the mixed race. They were basically
                    progressive and had the right ideas but just no structure. Whenever the
                    president tried to move things toward a more democratic basis, the militants
                    within his own party would object and the militants within the Indo Guyanese
                    party would take advantage of any evidence of weakness. He was trying to build
                    something in a country that had not only no experience with politics, but very
                    bad experience with independence.</p>
                <p>At the time of independence, Guyana was judged to be the wealthiest country in
                    the Caribbean. Even though it is on the mainland of South America, it was
                    considered one of the Caribbean islands and was in fact the headquarters of
                    Caricom, the community of the English speaking Caribbean. It was probably the
                    wealthiest, by statistics at the time certainly. The city was built wealthy.
                    Every house was Victorian gingerbread with indoor toilets, running water and all
                    cooking by electricity. They had one of the best school systems in the
                    Caribbean. As a matter of fact Guyanese graduates dominated the senior
                    professions throughout the Caribbean. When they had that big trial in Grenada
                    and put the head of the leftist party on trial, I found to my interest that both
                    the prosecuting and the defense attorneys, and four of the five members of the
                    Grenada Supreme Court were Guyanese and graduates of the school. But that was 30
                    years earlier.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Burnham came in with the radical socialist policy of service to the people and
                    distribution of wealth from these nasty capitalists and had spent the 30 years
                    spending the capital of Guyana. About half of the industries which had been
                    taken over by the government were now closed because equipment had failed, it
                    had not been maintained. There was electricity about four hours a day and this
                    in houses that had no other source of cooking or lighting than electricity.
                    There did not exist a market of cooking oil, cooking stoves, coal, anything
                    else, it was all electric. Water was intermittent, this in houses where there
                    were no wells where there were just running pipes water and you would turn on
                    the tap and nothing happens.</p>
                <p>It had gone from being the wealthiest to a condition of desperate poverty where
                    it was now considered to be only above Haiti. There was no obvious sources of
                    wealth except the rain forest. The rain forest had been given to the Amerindian
                    tribes in perpetuity which meant private exploitation but no general
                    exploitation. So the country was dead broke and the capital infrastructure was
                    in shambles and now the president for life was dead.</p>
                <p>One of the most disruptive policies of Burnham had been a decision that because
                    importing food allowed other countries to control you, he passed a law saying no
                    food may be imported. This was not too bad for the Afro Guyanese because their
                    culture was basically built around rice which grows well, but the Indo Guyanese
                    culture was based around wheat and wheat does not grow there. The effect had
                    been that they started smuggling wheat. They quickly found out that when you
                    don't pay taxes on smuggled goods, you make a greater profit so they started
                    smuggling other things. By the time that I got there a government minister
                    estimated that 70 percent of the economy was based on smuggling. It had now
                    expanded to include cocaine and other things from the Andes, using Guyana as a
                    way point. The government was surviving on remnants.</p>
                <p>One of the first things that Desmond Hoyte, the new president, did was work out a
                    reopening of the U.S. PL480 program to start bringing in wheat. I was seen as
                    negotiating this program and providing wheat to the Guyanese and my picture was
                    on the front page of every paper. People used to stop me on the street, clasp my
                    hands and say “Thank you for my chapattis.” We brought it in under the PL480
                    Title Two program which meant that it was sold for Guyanese dollars, for local
                    currency, and the local currency went into a pot which we at the embassy could
                    use for local developmental projects. There was an immediate benefit; wheat was
                    there, which gave a glow to this new regime plus a flow from developmental
                    projects which meant an increase in optimism. This enabled Hoyte to open up
                    negotiations on joining the Caribbean Basin Initiative which was a U.S.
                    sponsored program to give preferential trade and some development assistance
                    benefits to countries that qualified. While I was there they managed to join
                    CBI.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>It was a fascinating period because there was a real feeling of growth, of
                    change, of development, and of improvement, against the background of continuing
                    total political uncertainty because the people in Hoyte's party did not like
                    these changes. These were things that Burnham had fought against so they were
                    increasingly seeing Hoyte as a betrayer of the party. Cheddi Jagan did not like
                    these things because as a staunch Stalinist communist he was anti American and
                    did not like the PL480 program which increased U.S. popularity. He did not like
                    the CBI and wanted increased ties with Cuba. So you had a continuing weak
                    president with a party that was not supportive of the party's programs because
                    it was as a party, not getting any benefits from these popular programs. But the
                    opposition was equally negative. Every time an investor came in, and they
                    started to come in in good numbers, Cheddi Jagan's party would demonstrate
                    against them because this is exploitation by foreign investors. There were all
                    of these changes, and all of this opportunity, but no idea how it was going to
                    work out politically and nobody was willing to make any predictions about where
                    the future would be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cheddi Jagan is probably the only reason why most people
                        in the United States know of Guyana because he was always held up with his
                        American born wife and all and he was sort of the personality from
                        Guyana.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: You are forgetting Jim Jones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jim Jones, yes. That was '77. That was horrible. A
                        religious group that committed mass suicide there. Tell me about Cheddi
                        Jagan. What was your impression of him and dealing with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: He was personally, very personable. He was polite, courteous, an
                    interesting conversationalist but his mentality seemed to be frozen in a time
                    warp. He would just not acknowledge any of the changes in the world that had
                    taken place, not acknowledge what was happening in the Soviet Union, not
                    acknowledge what was happening to socialism worldwide. He was waiting to restore
                    things to the way they had been when he was young. His wife Janet seemed to be
                    in my judgment his intellectual superior. She also in her ordinary comments
                    reminded me of listening to radical SDS students in my youth. The two of them
                    had been politically prominent and yet out of politics for 28 years and they
                    were in a holding patterns. Cheddi's brother, also a dentist, was my dentist and
                    he used to fill my mouth full of things and then harangue me so that I couldn't
                    talk back. We dealt with him on a regular basis and his politics in world terms
                    was, as I said, frozen in the past.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>What was active politics was race. Everybody identified everybody else by their
                    race and knew mixing to the sixteenths. It is a very small community and so
                    everybody knew everybody else. The democrats who were mostly of mixed race
                    because they couldn't get into the other party, were intellectually stimulating
                    but largely ineffectual. The Catholic church was a radical opposition to the
                    government but criticizing only and not putting forward any particular social
                    programs of its own. It was a country that was going through so many changes
                    that everybody was uncertain and it was fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests during this '86 to '90
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Basically I saw American interests as trying to move Guyana away from a
                    reflexive anti Americanism to participation in local regional politics, a normal
                    association with the United States and with its neighbors, ending the state of
                    war with Venezuela which had been going on since I think '35, activation with
                    Caricom which had become just a name with no activity, and ending the drug
                    stream that was beginning to become quite prominent. The Heritage Foundation in
                    Washington, just about the time I went down there, came out with an article that
                    said there were dozens of airfields hidden in the jungles of Guyana which were
                    going to be used for an invasion of the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Heritage being a right wing political organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Very right wing and like many other things this particular article had
                    a few fragments of fact. Guyana had been a principal part of the U.S. air bridge
                    to North Africa during World War II. It's on the edge of South America and it's
                    a short hop across the Atlantic to Africa. We had built most of these air fields
                    so the air fields did exist. They were in use and were a matter of concern
                    because they were being used by small planes smuggling cocaine or marijuana, but
                    mostly cocaine. Guyana did have a left wing politics and was very pro Castro but
                    to add the three together and to talk about a security threat to the United
                    States is ludicrous but it was real. Since for 30 years every time that anybody
                    in the United States looked at Guyana there was a president who immediately said
                    something anti American, it had a lot of resonance in Washington.</p>
                <p>As charg� I felt that my job was to fight people in the Department of Treasury,
                    Department of State, Department of Justice, Department of this, that and the
                    other thing, who wanted to have nothing to do with Guyana. They wanted to have
                    no connections because Guyana was the enemy, the bad guys. I wanted to bring
                    people into the 20th century. It was eventually successful. Guyana reestablished
                    its relations with the IMF, joined the CBI and was turning itself around
                    economically.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Desmond Hoyte, after I left, lost the election because his party didn't support
                    him. Cheddi Jagan won and became president. Again an illustration of the way
                    that he was frozen in the past, it was not until after he was elected that he
                    realized that he had nobody in his party with any experience in governments. He
                    ended up turning to the middle class, non party people, mostly Indo Guyanese but
                    even that not exclusively, to staff his own government. He ended up with a
                    technocratic government behind him that did not follow his own policies so the
                    country has continued to grow. Cheddi died and now his wife Janet has been
                    elected as president. As I say, I think that she is the intellectual superior of
                    the two and I think that she has been persuaded by these technocrats to continue
                    these basic policies so Guyana has now changed directions and has moved into the
                    mainstream. I think that is valuable to the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there was the American invasion of
                        Grenada sort of hovering over? Was there concern that if things went too
                        much left that the United States might do something? Did you have to deal
                        with that or not, or was that over and past?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: It had just occurred and so it was a matter of intense interest but for
                    some reason there was no paranoia, there was no feeling that it had anything to
                    do with Guyana. It just had to do with the United States and what kind of a
                    country the United States was. It interfered particularly within the Hoyte
                    party, the Afro Guyanese party, when Hoyte and I talked about these new
                    programs, he would talk about how that affected the willingness of people in his
                    party to trust the United States but it was one of a number of obstacles to
                    overcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Cubans, how active were they there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: They had been extremely active and they had a very large presence. But
                    Burnham died because he had a fairly minor medical problem and rather than go to
                    for example the United States or Europe to have it treated, he asked for a Cuban
                    doctor to be flown in to operate on him in Guyana. He died on the operating
                    table. That can happen but that put a severe negative slant on attitude toward
                    the Cubans. They were suddenly seen as incompetent, like Burnham. Now that
                    Burnham was gone people were able to say that he had been incompetent and the
                    Cubans were seen as associated with that bad period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about UN votes, was that a problem for you all at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: No. Basically Guyana could not afford to have much of any presence in
                    New York. Very often there was nobody in its mission. When it voted it tended to
                    vote as a block with the G 77 and it was not seen as being a leader in any
                    sense. If we could persuade the G 77 to back off on this, then Guyana would back
                    off. It was just a follower.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the drug interdiction campaign, were you able to
                        do much there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: There was perfect willingness of people to participate in the drug
                    interdiction campaign. There is not a drug culture in Guyana. There is a small
                    group of Rastafarians who use ganja, or marijuana, but basically it is a middle
                    class Victorian kind of an attitude and they look down on drug users. What you
                    had was South American drug dealers who were paying off individuals and using
                    secluded air fields or inlets to meet and greet and exchange. The government of
                    Guyana literally had no infrastructure to combat this. They did not have
                    airplanes, they had no boats for a customs service. We supplied them with two
                    used boats which delighted them and they immediately set out catching small
                    boats that were running drugs and other things. The problem came when they were
                    trying to figure out how can you stop drugs without stopping the people who were
                    bringing in bread and wheat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you are talking about the smuggling.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Yes. Since the smuggling was universal, they had to learn how to figure
                    out how to distinguish. We supplied them with a number of GPS, global
                    positioning system, receivers to put on small planes which was the only way some
                    of these communities in Guyana had any connections. Every year they had been
                    losing two to three planes and passengers somewhere in the jungles, somewhere in
                    the rain forest. While I was there we discovered three World War II U.S.
                    aircraft with crews suspended 300 feet high in the canopy. They crashed, gone
                    under the top leaves and they were invisible. They were too high up for people
                    to get down and the pilots and crews that survived, starved to death. This was
                    still happening every day because they would get a radio signal saying I'm going
                    down and then they were visually trying to search 500 square miles of rain
                    forest. GPS meant that they could go out and not be afraid of crashing so they
                    were willing to risk their planes and so they shut down a number of these
                    airfields.</p>
                <p>The willingness was there. Once they had the equipment they tried but again what
                    they could do was reduce it. Most of these airfields are nothing but a grassy
                    strip someplace and unless they happen to have a plane there at that time, a
                    small plane could fly in, land, they didn't have radar coverage. Everything was
                    makeshift and very poor but the capacity and willingness was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the collapse of the Soviet Union which happened just
                        towards the end when you were there, have any repercussions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: No. Cheddi Jagan didn't believe it which meant that the Indo Guyanese
                    didn't believe it. The government was too occupied to have it concern them. They
                    were focused on their Caribbean neighbors and on the United States now. Yes,
                    Desmond Hoyte said it made it easier to make his arguments with his cabinet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did an ambassador come in while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Yes. Right towards the end, and this was a career mistake on my part,
                    an ambassador was finally named after Guyana rejoined the IMF and the CBI. She
                    named her own DCM but then the State Department asked me to stay on for a few
                    months. I agreed to stay on for four months and it was a very difficult period.
                    It was her first assignment as an ambassador. She had fought her way up against
                    a very sexist Foreign Service and was still in a competition mode with
                    everybody. She felt that I was competition, that her political and economic
                    officers were competition, and that her whole staff was, and she had to prove
                    herself better than anyone else. It was a very difficult period particularly
                    because just before I left we had an inspection and the inspectors came down and
                    were very rough on her. At that time she was thinking of resigning but she did
                    not and now she has gotten another ambassadorial post. I hope that she's learned
                    to be an ambassador and not a competitor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '90 what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: In '90 at the end my tour I went up to, again a sideways thing, to
                    IO/D, International Organizations/Development. This is the office of Development
                    responsible for about 750 million dollars in U.S. funds to all of the
                    development agencies like UNDP, UNICEF, World Food Program. We had 17 different
                    agencies. It is a joint State AID office and this was the turn of AID to name
                    the director. A friend of mine called and asked if I would be willing to be the
                    deputy director, the senior State man in this. It was a very interesting
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '90 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: '90 and '91 so two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this two years, '90 and '91, how did you find the
                        atmosphere of IO at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: We had a very ideological assistant secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>McGAFFEY: John Bolton. One of his major issues was preventing the PLO from
                    getting representation anywhere in the UN system, and maintaining the prevention
                    of funding of family planning according to the right wing ideology.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anti abortion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: Anti abortion but also anti , I don't want to say anti UN but it almost
                    ended up to be that he saw his job as preventing damage to the U.S. interests
                    from this UN system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is odd because this is the Bush administration and
                        Bush was not as opposed to the United Nations as was Reagan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: No and that's why I say it was almost that because it was never
                    explicit, it was just that was the underlying feeling that I got while I was in
                    IO. AID was very interested in development obviously but there was also a good
                    deal of jealousy. They wanted to make sure that the UN development system did
                    not take over any AID prerogatives and so the woman I worked with as the
                    director felt that that was one of her priorities.</p>
                <p>I started to have very serious personnel problems with the State Department at
                    that time. Terri Tull, the temporary superior ambassador who succeeded me, did
                    not supervise me long enough to write an EER. The country director who had
                    worked with me through my tour had left the Latin America bureau just before
                    Terri Tull got assigned and the new country director knew nothing about me. The
                    assistant secretary for Latin America was never interested in the English
                    speaking countries in Latin America and second was very much embroiled in
                    political difficulties down in Nicaragua and El Salvador. This assistant
                    secretary, Jim (can't think of the name), had been a hangover from the Reagan
                    administration who was now having to defend himself about the Iran Contra.</p>
                <p>At any rate what that turned out to be is that I had no ratings or no rater for
                    the last two and a half years, from Voice of America, which was odd, where I
                    didn't have a Foreign Service rater, to the present assignment where my boss was
                    an AID officer. Despite my efforts I never got anything into my record to cover
                    that whole period. The only thing I got in to cover the VOA period was an
                    inspectors report, (an inspector came over and inspected what I did) and a
                    letter from the director of VOA. When I talked to the personnel people and to
                    the director general they said that given this absence of information I should
                    probably not expect to be promoted unless I got put on the ambassadors list or
                    possibly got a very visible DCM position. They didn't think that was likely
                    because they had no record of my success or failure as a DCM.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Basically I decided I'd relax and I decided I would do a good job at IO/D and
                    represent the United States. I had two ambassadors and two principal officers
                    overseas reporting to me. I was sitting all the boards of all of these
                    organizations representing the United States. I was responsible for more money
                    than most FSOs ever see and I probably wasn't going to go anywhere in the
                    Foreign Service. So I focused on the international organizations. After I left
                    the Foreign Service I ended up writing a book about two years of negotiations
                    with the World Food Program which was interesting. I learned a great deal about
                    bureaucratic multilateral organizations, UN organizations. I found myself to be
                    a very effective negotiator and was seen as a very effective negotiator and I
                    was sent to places to negotiate specific things. I stayed there for my entire
                    tour and having been informed that I was not going to be promoted, I retired at
                    the end of that tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this development fund and the American role in it,
                        used at as an instrument of furthering American foreign policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McGAFFEY: The intent was very much there and yes it was but it often got tied up
                    in the complexities of determining what U.S. interests and what U.S. policy we
                    were promoting. For example, during a major negotiation in Rome we were trying
                    to get an American elected as president of the assembly of the Food and
                    Agricultural Organization, the FAO. We wanted an American elected as president
                    as a balance to the director of the FAO, Saouma, who we felt was excessively
                    interested in his own power and rewarding his own clique. We wanted to get the
                    program back into a non political mode.</p>
                <p>Our biggest weapon was the fact that in the FAO, as in most other organizations,
                    we were in arrears and we had in Washington negotiated the money. We could pay
                    off the arrears and pay up U.S. dues to the FAO, if the FAO was an effective
                    organization. We were using this very explicitly to plump for an American
                    president. The other candidate was a prot�g� of the director, another expatriate
                    Lebanese. The director had the big gun of the responsibility for the
                    administration of the program and if you displease the director your country
                    might not get the FAO programs. But the U.S. had the equally big gun of the
                    money that the organization needed to operate and if you displeased the U.S. and
                    the U.S. doesn't pay its arrears there won't be any program for anybody.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>We were fairly confident that we were going to succeed, not easily but we were
                    going to succeed. Then the PLO put in a petition saying that Palestinian farmers
                    in Israel were being discriminated against and they wanted an FAO program to
                    assist Palestinian farmers only. The assistant secretary of IO saw this as
                    another attempt by the PLO to get status within the UN system and he insisted
                    that we give equal priority blocking this program for the PLO. We tried to
                    insert it as part of the evenness and say that we would support a program to
                    provide assistance to farmers in Israel of whatever origin but not just one side
                    in the political thing. We ended up, fairly narrowly, losing on both issues.
                    They passed the Palestinian program by about 52 to 48 percent and they elected
                    the prot�g� of the director by 51 to 49 percent. I think that we would have won
                    the presidency and with the president there would have blocked any program but
                    the insistence on the two things came at the same point.</p>
                <p>Similarly we were working with UNICEF, UNDP and the various other agencies
                    involved in assistance to women and trying to promote assistance to women but
                    most of the programs involving assistance to women included some family
                    planning. Even if there was no abortion in those programs, if it said family
                    planning and UN, there was a reflexive anti. And so we were trying to promote
                    women's programs but we stopped all the programs that were proposed. We had a
                    big gun but we did not have this consistency of policy. The UN basically is not
                    seen in Washington as a principal actor. In the field it very often is but it is
                    hard to get Washington to see that.</p>
