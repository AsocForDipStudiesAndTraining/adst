                <p>AMBASSADOR ANDREW STEIGMAN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 29, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you become interested in foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: It was a gradual process, I suspect. It went back clearly to my high
                    school days because I picked my undergraduate university for its program in
                    international affairs, Princeton, at the Woodrow Wilson School. The interest
                    clearly was there at the time I was applying. I still remember reading the
                    undergraduate catalog and being absolutely fascinated by the courses they
                    offered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you known anybody in the Foreign Service or any idea
                        of what the diplomatic service was about or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: No, the specific interest in the Foreign Service presumably came at
                    Princeton. It must have been somewhere then that I decided to take the exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you go into Princeton? What years were you at
                        Princeton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: 1950 to 1954. I applied for and took the Foreign Service exam during
                    the academic year 1954-55.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were already into the foreign affairs apparatus
                        with the Fulbright and all that. What were you doing in the Fulbright in
                        London?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I went up to London in the London School of Economics for a year
                    basically to start looking at Africa. I got interested in Africa, the one area
                    in which Princeton had no courses. I felt it was a gap. I had done course work
                    on the Middle East. I had done course work on the Far East and Europe. But I
                    knew nothing about Africa, and it was a period of great change in Africa, and I
                    wanted to know something about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this was when that you were in London?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: 1954-55.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really all of Africa was, at that point, still colonial
                        and it really wasn't opening up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: It was clearly moving in that direction, though. It was only three
                    years before the early independence of Ghana and then of Guinea and then the
                    whole series of independences in 1960. There was clearly movement in that
                    direction. With an eye, if you will, to the Foreign Service, the appeal of
                    Africa was that there was no established U.S. policy. This was going to be
                    tabula rasa. You looked anywhere else in the world, and there were great
                    constraints on U.S. policy. Latin America never interested me because it always
                    seemed to be just too much of an American chasse gard�e. There were people who
                    had been serving there for years and then a mind set. The Far East, we had just
                    gone through the “who lost China” business, and again it seemed that any attempt
                    to be creative in policy in the Far East was going to be burdened by that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you are, a young grad student, talking about
                        policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Well, to be part of something that was not completely locked in and had
                    some chance for movement, a chance for actually putting an imprint on what was
                    going to happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting out of the London School of
                        Economics about Africa at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: The study of African government and society, the evolution of Africa
                    governments, varying colonial policies. I had almost no background in that. That
                    was my introductory background to the continent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the London School pushing did you feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: To the extent that they were pushing anything, the woman I studied
                    with, Lucy Mair, was essentially telling us how good the British were in
                    diminution, the gradual transfer of power to Africans and careful preparation
                    for independence. There was somewhat lighter emphasis toward the other colonial
                    powers, but I do remember to this day the studies of how the legislative council
                    increased the percentage of elected members and the executive council gradually
                    moved from appointed to elected members, the very elaborate structure through
                    which the British made the transition toward independence. But it was a very
                    planned process and the British are rightly proud of it, I suspect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you were going to serve also later as ambassador
                        to a country that was under French rule, did you have any feel for how the
                        French were doing it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Somewhat less. Inevitably LSE stressed the British. The French and
                    others I picked up more when I did additional graduate work after I got into the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the great disaster of all colonial transitions,
                        the Belgian Congo and the Belgian way? Did anybody even talk about it or say
                        there was going to be a problem there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: No, because the Belgians assumed in 1955 that independence would not
                    come practically in that century to the Belgian Congo. That was certainly the
                    Belgian assumption. In 1955 a Belgian professor proposed a 30-year transition
                    plan of independence for the Congo, and was hooted down as a dangerous radical.
                    That would have meant independence in 1985. The Belgian Congo was not looked at
                    very much by those who were pursuing the questions of transition to
                    independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you really had your eye on Africa as something to do at
                        a time when I don't think many people were thinking about Africa at all. I
                        know, I came into the Foreign Service in 1955, and it was only three years
                        later that I started thinking about Africa. I never went there, but this
                        looked like a target of opportunity. It was only when I was in the system
                        and looking around for a place to go that all of a sudden Africa crossed my
                        horizon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I came into the Foreign Service with an eye on Africa clearly. I
                    already had the interest in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is, maybe, not unique but certainly this is not the
                        way most of the people who were involved in conservative foreign affairs
                        were looking at things at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Well, it was a very new discipline. Even in the academic community
                    there were really only two centers of African Studies in the U.S. at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Northwestern and Boston. As I said, as an undergraduate at Princeton, I
                    had no African courses to take. African courses didn't exist there, and you had
                    to go and scrounge if you wanted to do more studying in the African field. But
                    by the time I got into the Service, I was one of, I guess, two people in my
                    entering class of '58 with a strong interest in Africa. Oddly enough the other
                    one kept asking to go to Africa. First he went to London, then he went to
                    Stockholm, then they sent him to Columbia to study North Atlantic up there. So
                    he said, “Well, it wasn't meant to be”. He stopped asking for it. By then he was
                    a European specialist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get into the Foreign Service actually?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I took the written exam in London in, I suspect, it was the spring of
                    '55. I think then the exam was given in April. The records would no doubt tell
                    when it was done that year. I took the oral exam in January or February of 1956,
                    by which time I had already been drafted. I was in the military service. I'm
                    still convinced that one of the reasons I was treated kindly on the oral exam
                    was that I turned up in uniform. I was in basic training back then. I had to get
                    a day's leave to go take the exam and showed up in uniform which I think at
                    least convinced the examiners that I wasn't trying to duck the draft by entering
                    the Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any African exposure in the service or
                        anything that . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: No, I was sent off to Germany for a year, which was fine. I got to see
                    a good deal of Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I served my time in Germany, too. Well, then you came
                        into the Foreign Service when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: In April, 1958.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With your class, how would you characterize the people who
                        were coming in at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: We were a class of 25 white males. I had the impression that the
                    classes before and after us were very similar. In retrospect it seems quite
                    incredible that there were practically no women and no minorities at all and
                    nobody really thought much about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I came in in July of '55. We were white males, and it
                        didn't occur to me that there were any gaps in this process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: But in retrospect it was clearly a remarkably unrepresentative service.
                    I met a couple of women junior officers who were not in my class. In fact, one
                    of the ones who came in about the same time was Roz Ridgway. So clearly some of
                    the women officers who came in at that time were incredibly good and presumably
                    had to be to get through this very, very tough filter. But we were 25 initially,
                    one dropped out before the end of training, so 24 ended up going on first
                    assignments. The other odd thing, looking back, was that all 24 who were
                    assigned stayed in Washington, first assignments in the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was odd because that was not normally the pattern was
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I think it tended to be about half-and-half in those days. It wasn't
                    what it is today in which everybody goes overseas. But most other classes at
                    least some people went overseas. From my class everybody after the, it was then,
                    I think, 12-week orientation and training, stayed in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't that sort of a let-down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I'm not sure it was, because as I recall, I think at the time we felt
                    it was probably not a bad idea to get a feel for the Department in a more
                    familiar setting, that we would be better equipped when we did go overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I'm sure it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I'm trying to remember, were we on probationary status at that
                    time?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I think there . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: No, we weren't in a formal sense. We had reserve appointments
                    initially, but that was simply an interim measure until they could get the
                    confirmations from the Senate. But there was no probationary status, there was
                    no tenure process, so the Department didn't need to make the same kind of
                    judgment that it needs to make today with probationary status. So there was no
                    hurry to get us overseas. The other bizarre thing, of course, was that we all
                    got consular training as part of the 12-week training even though nobody went
                    overseas to use it.</p>

                        use it right away or else it's very easily forgettable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: As I discovered when I went overseas two years later as an economic
                    officer, supposedly, but arrived at my first post and discovered that the
                    consular officer had just been selected out and I was told that I was going to
                    have to fill in as consular officer my first two and a half months. And I said,
                    “Whoops!” I had to review the stuff because I hadn't expected to need it. I had
                    to re-read the manuals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other thing about the class that came in just to get a
                        picture of the time, can you describe what was your impression of the
                        motivation of the interests of your group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: The impression that I had was that the people who were coming in at
                    that time were there because they thought it was a worthwhile thing to do, that
                    it was an interesting career. They certainly viewed it as a career coming in,
                    not just as a job. It was something that they looked forward to doing for the
                    rest of their lives, the bulk at least, their working profession. And they
                    seemed to have a sense that working on American foreign policy was important and
                    worthwhile. We had at least one who had a law degree and left a law practice to
                    come in. I think we had, in fact, two lawyers. I'm sure of one. The average age
                    probably was 28 or 29. I was just under 25. I was the second youngest in the
                    class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think one other thing that you didn't mention but I
                        assume is probably true that the great majority had had military service of
                        one kind or another, hadn't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Probably over half. In fact, the youngest member of the class is now
                    the Staff Director of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Gerry
                    Christianson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave this, could you do a little contrasting?
                        You're teaching here at Georgetown in the School of Foreign Service, and
                        you're seeing people who are going into the Foreign Service. Outside of the
                        fact that it's no longer all white male, can you see any other
                        dissimilarities between those that are going in regarding outlook and
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: It's funny. They start, I think, looking at the Foreign Service with
                    the same kinds of assumptions that we held 30 years ago—and that it's something
                    exciting, it's something worthwhile and you want to be part of the foreign
                    policy process. I have to question them a little bit since the Service has
                    changed to make sure that they understand that what they are going into may not
                    turn out to be a life-long career. It's not the same degree of loyalty from the
                    top down as there was.</p>
                <p>As a result, I think that a number of them wind up taking it not with the idea
                    that they're going to be in it for the rest of their working lives, but they're
                    going to test it. Job mobility is much greater today than it was 30 years ago,
                    the willingness to change jobs, a sense of risk-taking is present, I think, to a
                    greater degree, possibly because there are also more women now. Some women are
                    not sure if they want to do lifetime careers, whether they want to have a career
                    for a few years and then have a more traditional wife and mother role. They
                    haven't really sorted out their own priorities yet, and even for the men,
                    recognizing what they're going to have to deal with if they want to get married
                    to women who may wish to pursue careers on their own. The Foreign Service may be
                    incompatible with that. All kinds of different motivations are applied.</p>
                <p>The kids going in, I must say, are at least as bright as we were, and I think as
                    I consider my own class I suspect they're brighter. They're better prepared
                    today particularly because you are drawing on a larger group through a more
                    competitive process. When you were only drawing on white males, you had to go a
                    little bit deeper to get the same number of people. Now that you are going after
                    qualified minorities and especially the large number of women, you can just take
                    the cream off the top in all categories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first position in State was in INR. Was that dealing
                        with Africa at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Yes. That was North Africa which at that point was considered, of
                    course, part of Africa. Both in INR and in the Bureau, everything on the
                    continent except Egypt belonged to Africa. I had indicated that I wanted to work
                    on Africa and got the job at INR. It's interesting because my name was sent over
                    to INR for vetting, and I actually got an interview at INR before I got the job
                    which was a rather different procedure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. The Service is not much larger actually than it was
                        then, but I think there was a little more care taken.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Well, yes, more care taken . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More family.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: More family, but also more opportunity, if you will, to discriminate
                    because it was done on the basis of personal likes and dislikes. I mean, that
                    still exists certainly. It's a lot easier to get a good job if you can find
                    somebody who likes you and who is in a position to influence the decision
                    because the Bureau still has a great deal of weight in job choices. But you do
                    have a central system that tries to look after the people who don't have
                    mentors, that tries to even the odds out a little bit, at least, and that didn't
                    really exist in those days. Personnel was totally decentralized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of INR? What was the role of INR
                        when you were dealing with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: INR was doing much more basic research than it has done in recent years
                    and a lot of its resources went in to producing the old National Intelligence
                    Survey. I must have spent two-thirds of my work time that two years at INR
                    writing NIS chapters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you describe what an NIS is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: The National Intelligence Surveys were essentially encyclopedias. There
                    was one for each country. It was possible to have up to about 60 chapters in
                    each INS though they were not all written for every country. But there were
                    chapters on the economy and on the political system and on the court system and
                    on the social structure. I was doing political system and social structure
                    chapters on the North African countries. I did four or five of these things over
                    two years. They were massive productions. While you worked on them, if something
                    came up you were pulled off and did current intelligence as well as the basic
                    research. The basic research was really terribly academic in nature. Finally,
                    the responsibility for the NIS production was shipped out to Central
                    Intelligence entirely. Chapters were written originally in different places,
                    Defense did the military ones, the CIA did some and we did some. But finally it
                    was all consolidated under the CIA and INR went back to being a current
                    intelligence support activity which is, I think, much more appropriate.</p>
                <p>But the current intelligence opportunity was fascinating because a lot was
                    happening in North Africa—this is 1958-60—including the fun of writing the first
                    intelligence pieces on the consequences for Libya discovering oil in 1959.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. We'll come back to Libya, but let's move to your
                        assignment to Leopoldville. You were there from 1960 to '62. You couldn't
                        have asked for a better time to go to a country or a worse time to go to a
                        country. Could you describe when you arrived what the situation was at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: When we arrived there, the situation was very peaceful. It was the
                    Belgian Congo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You arrived when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: We arrived in March of '60, three and a half months before
                    independence. There was a certain amount of what the Belgians might call
                    effervescence because everybody was anticipating independence. There was great
                    excitement in the anticipation of independence. New political coalitions were
                    forming and reforming in a very, very inexperienced and unstructured body
                    politic, and it was great fun trying to keep up with it. I mean, we were working
                    our heads off, and we still had a very small, understaffed consulate
                    general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a consulate general when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Yes, facing a transition to independence it had one political officer;
                    one economic officer, me; one consular officer, also me for the first couple of
                    months, so I overlapped the economic officer I was replacing for about a month;
                    one CIA officer; an administrative officer and a GSO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a consul general.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: A consul general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Tommy Tomlinson was the consul general. Jerry LeValle was the number
                    two and the political officer. Jerry was very good and knew everybody. He knew a
                    lot of the Congolese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering, was it difficult to meet the Congolese at
                        that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: No, Jerry knew a lot of them. He had very good relations with a number
                    of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there was any way to get a hold of them? I don't mean
                        get a hold of them, but since the Belgians had sort of excluded them so much
                        from leadership positions . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: At the point we got there, of course, they were preparing for
                    leadership and leadership transition. A lot of them very much wanted to talk to
                    the Americans. They were very inexperienced. They really didn't know what they
                    were dealing with or how they were going to cope, and they were coming around
                    looking for advice and counsel. The Belgians obviously were going to be the main
                    source, but some of these guys didn't trust the Belgians and wanted to talk to
                    other people. So a number of them had started to talk to the Americans. Both
                    Jerry and the CIA guy, we had them make contacts. They were the two people,
                    really, working in the political field and were starting to meet people and talk
                    to them and get a feel for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Belgians? Were they sort of being the dog in
                        the manger at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Oh, no. The Belgian gamble was to give the Congolese their independence
                    before they were ready for it on the assumption that the Congolese would then be
                    totally dependent on the Belgians and the Belgians would stay and run things
                    from behind the scenes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was open talk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Oh, yes. The Congolese were clearly unprepared. The Belgians had done
                    nothing for generations to prepare them. They had trained only a handful beyond
                    the high school level. They essentially were training clerks and locomotive
                    drivers on the assumption the Belgians would continue to run things. They
                    figured, “Okay, we'll make the clerks office directors and ministers, and the
                    locomotive drivers will become the presidents of the corporations, but obviously
                    they won't know what to do so their Belgium counselors behind the scenes will
                    continue to make all the decisions.” It might have worked if they had been not
                    quite so heavy handed with the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you all doing? Were you going around and saying,
                        “This is a hell of a way to run a railroad!” and telling people this? or
                        just saying this isn't our business so we'll just report on what's
                        happening.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: On my level, we were just reporting. I was so busy running the consular
                    section and trying to do economic reporting on what was happening, to fix the
                    position of exchange controls and the risks of capital, the way the Belgians
                    were behaving, what was happening to—you know, we had all these periodic mineral
                    reports and agricultural. Since I was doing two jobs, I was just totally
                    occupied with that. I mean, I would wind up going over trade figures at night
                    and reading the consular manuals at night to try to solve problems, plus trying
                    to move into a house and trying to get our household goods in. It was a very
                    busy two or three months. I'm really not sure what line was being taken by the
                    consul general and Jerry when they talked with the Congolese.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's come to when independence came. What were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Well, independence came very peacefully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was which day?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: June 30th. There were big ceremonies, delegations from abroad, we had a
                    major delegation with our ambassador-to-be and a couple of other senior
                    representatives, and the Belgians orchestrated it pretty well. The
                    transportation worked. Lumumba, then who was the new prime minister, made a
                    rather sour speech which insulted King Baudouin. He was establishing his
                    nationalist credentials. Apart from that, it all went off fairly well and
                    everybody congratulated themselves that they seemed to have passed the moment of
                    independence, the flags had changed and the Belgians were saying, “Aha! Okay.
                    You know the surface appearances have changed, now we can go back to business as
                    usual.”</p>
                <p>It might have worked if the guy who ran the military, the Force Publique, General
                    Jassens had not been so heavy-handed. Had he made a couple of quick promotions
                    of Congolese sergeants to be junior officers and give them quick
                    responsibilities in visible leadership positions with a Belgium advisor, they
                    might have gotten away with it for a little while. Janssens has said in a
                    meeting with the troops and sergeants apparently something about the fact that,
                    look, they're not going to have any Congolese, it's going to be a slow
                    transition, the Belgians are going to continue to run this, this is a military
                    operation, by God, and it can't be done the sloppy way the civilians are doing
                    it, which triggered mutiny. And since there were a lot more Congolese than there
                    were Belgians, that was the end of the one force that was able to maintain order
                    and all uncertainty rushed to the surface. The place essentially came apart, and
                    the Belgians panicked. The troops rampaged on a couple of military bases, people
                    gotten beaten up, several women were raped, very few deaths. It was mostly, I
                    think, a repaying of past humiliations.</p>
                <p>The Congolese had always been treated as very much inferior beings, and one
                    suspects that the people who were beaten, raped, abused, were those who probably
                    had used a certain amount of abuse on the Congolese in the past, and that those,
                    in fact, who had treated the Congolese well in the past probably were not hurt.
                    The stories were wildly exaggerated in the telling. The numbers of people who
                    had been assaulted, who had been killed had been magnified, and there was
                    general panic. Most of the Belgians fled the country.</p>
                <p>The Belgians then sent troops in to try to restore order to try and protect their
                    nationals, stirring a real anti-Belgian feeling because here we are independent,
                    our sovereignty is being abused, we're being invaded. There was a call for UN
                    intervention by the Congolese; they called for a UN force. We were there when
                    history was being made.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing during this period of time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: At that point, the consular section, fortunately, was out of my hands
                    and the consular officer had turned up around the beginning of June.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There must have been a terrible demand on the consular
                        officer for Americans trying to get out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: No, there were hardly any Americans then. There were almost no American
                    citizens. The Belgians just wanted to go home. There was no time to do any
                    immigrant visa business. People were just fleeing and if they had to do any visa
                    business they were going to have to go elsewhere. So the consular section, in
                    fact, was not terribly busy. What the consular officer did, in fact, was try to
                    manage the emergency evacuation effort because there was very little immediate
                    demand from Americans in the capital. But I guess what we were doing more than
                    anything else was trying to figure out what was going on. We were all trying to
                    sort out rumors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's try now to reconstruct where we were. What were you
                        doing at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: We were pretty much running around trying to find out what was going
                    on. Once the Force Publique had mutinied, the question was what remained in the
                    way of government structures, and we were really trying to find out who was in
                    charge, how much control they had, how were the factions forming and reforming.
                    We had people running in and out of the embassy. We had a group of very
                    inexperience Congolese ministers. We didn't know whether the ministries were
                    functioning or not. We didn't know with whom we could deal on questions of
                    anything — everything ranging from security to possible economic assistance. A
                    large part of our problem was just trying to track down the people who were in
                    charge. The place had come apart before they could put an organizational
                    structure into place, and it was a very confusing atmosphere in which to
                    operate. We were also very busily engaged going back and forth with Lumumba. He
                    first asked for U.S. forces, then when we said no, he asked for U.N. forces. At
                    one point he asked the Russians for help, and we were trying to keep track of
                    it, trying to influence decisions. The whole story is told in Madeline Kalb's
                    book, The Congo Cables.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of support were you getting? Speaking of the
                        Congo cables, these were cables between our mission in Leopoldville and
                        Washington. What instructions was Washington giving you at the time? Were
                        you just playing it by ear?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I must say, most of what I remember of this comes from having reread
                    Madeline Kalb's book a few years ago, but not recently enough to be able to give
                    you the details. I really think the book is going to be a much better source on
                    it than my recollection at this point in terms of the substance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Now I want to touch more on what you were doing. Did
                        you feel under any threat yourself? Was it a dangerous time for you and your
                        family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: The first couple of weeks we were really not sure how the Congolese
                    military were going to behave. Initially, a day or two after the mutiny, we were
                    advised by the embassy not to leave our homes. The Force Publique had set up
                    roadblocks, and we weren't really sure what instructions they had been given.
                    Then the embassy got word that Lumumba was going to make an inflammatory speech
                    over the radio at noon, and the network called everybody and said, “Okay, form
                    up into convoys. Everybody come down to the embassy as a safe haven in case we
                    need to get out.” Nobody was quite sure, and Lumumba was considered quite
                    unpredictable. Nobody was quite sure what he was going to do or whether he was
                    going to call on the Congolese to throw out all the foreigners. He didn't. So we
                    set up convoys and went down and worked our way through a series of roadblocks,
                    and all grouped at the embassy. The Lumumba speech was not sufficiently
                    inflammatory to put us in any danger, but we still weren't sure. We weren't sure
                    how they were going to look at the Americans.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, the Congolese man in the street and most of the troops looked
                    at the Americans as friends. We were next door to the Portuguese Embassy, and
                    the Portuguese were considered terrible colonialists. One time they came and
                    there was a hostile demonstration at the Portuguese Embassy with a certain
                    amount of rock throwing. Then they started marching, and we were right next
                    door, and we didn't know whether we were going to get rocked. They pulled up in
                    front and they gave us three cheers, and then they went on to stone the British
                    Embassy. But we didn't know. As the crowd came by, we really were not sure what
                    their reaction was going to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get a little idea of how now all of a sudden you're
                        no longer a consulate general, you're an embassy. Were any more people sent
                        in to help you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Oh, yes. We got tons of people at that point. We got two political
                    officers. We got Army, Navy and Air Force attach�s. We got additional CIA
                    personnel. We got additional administrative help. The staff suddenly
                    tripled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But all of them were obviously unfamiliar with the
                        situation there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Yes, but on the other hand, the old hands, for the most part, who had
                    been there, like me, had been there for two months. So we weren't exactly
                    in-depth experts. We were all learning very quickly. This was a brand-new ball
                    game.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Clare Timberlake came out as the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you operate? I'm speaking now about the officers.
                        Did you all get together in the morning and say, “Tell me, what the hell is
                        happening here,” and sort of share information and then fan out, or what
                        would you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: The first ten days after the mutiny when we were all assembled in the
                    embassy, we slept in the embassy. Families were all evacuated. Women employees
                    were offered the option of evacuating if they wished to. We only had, I think,
                    two secretaries who were evacuated. Essentially it was entirely voluntary; it
                    was not an ordered evacuation. My wife stayed. The consular officer, who was a
                    woman, stayed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was she?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Alison Palmer. I think there was one woman working with the CIA who
                    stayed. But otherwise it was essentially an all-male group, and we just lived in
                    the embassy for the first couple of weeks. At that point, we had our staff
                    meetings around midnight or whenever we finished for the day. Anytime between
                    10:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m., we would all gather in the ambassador's office, and we
                    would all have a drink and we would all talk over what had happened during the
                    day and what was likely to happen tomorrow so that when we got up we knew what
                    we were going to start with, we knew what rumors we had to track down, who we
                    needed to talk to. People reported on which journalists they had met with during
                    the day and what stories the journalists had come in with.</p>
                <p>We were working very closely with the American press. There were some top
                    reporters that had come out there, and they were, in effect, almost extra
                    political officers for the embassy because we were very open with them. They
                    would bring us the stories that they picked up, and we would tell them whether
                    or not we had information that could confirm or if we had totally contradictory
                    information so that their reporting would be as accurate as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to say that I was in Washington and was in INR
                        dealing with African affairs. Although I had the Horn of Africa, obviously
                        the Belgian Congo was number one on our list. Most of the reports that we
                        were looking at because they came faster were the news reports. These seemed
                        to be rather wild at the time talking about armies moving through the jungle
                        and all that. It was a peculiar time. To get an idea of how a brand new
                        embassy works in a crisis, what would you do? I mean, you say you go out and
                        track down rumors. How does one as a Foreign Service officer go out and
                        track down a rumor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: We would do the same kinds of things that the press people would do. We
                    would drop in on different ministries, drop in on different offices, make phone
                    calls, we would check with the journalists to see what they were picking up,
                    check whatever sources we could reach. I'd say the big problem in those days for
                    all of us, the journalists and the embassy alike, was we weren't sure who was
                    where. We also had a number of people who would drop in to see us. There would
                    be a rumor, for example, that Lumumba had ordered the arrest of the Foreign
                    Minister. We would try to find out. We would start calling people who might be
                    in a position to know. We got the final answer when the Foreign Minister showed
                    up at the embassy and went up and took refuge in the ambassador's office, then
                    there was an arrest order out on him. That's how we found out for sure. That was
                    the absolute confirmation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You saw a whole bunch of people from the press. At that
                        time, it was mostly the written press rather than the TV press. Again,
                        coming into an unfamiliar place, and the word there going out was of
                        paramount importance to how the world would view this. As I say, at INR we
                        were responding probably more to press reports at that time because they
                        were coming first. But how did you evaluate their reporting? How good were
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: The top American reporters who were there at different times, people
                    like Lloyd Garrison, Paul Hoffman, later David Halberstam, Jonathan Randal, were
                    among the best foreign correspondents in the business. They tried very hard to
                    be sure that their reports were accurate and were well documented. We didn't
                    read their stuff, but we talked to them and had a sense from talking to them
                    what they were going to report. All I can say is that from that side of the
                    experience, we had the impression they were trying to be very careful to sift
                    out the wild rumor and the exaggerated story and to keep it out of their
                    accounts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about some of the other reporters? These, of course,
                        were the main reporters and the main ones that were read by policy
                        makers.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Yes. I mean, the New York Times people, the International Herald
                    Tribune people, the people from the major news services, I'd say they tried to
                    be very responsible. It was, however, as you've also noted, extremely difficult
                    to sort out the facts, and these guys were working on deadlines. We had the
                    luxury that we did not have to get a report in by 2:00 in order to get it into
                    the morning paper. We could wait until 6:00 if that extra four hours helped us
                    confirm something. So you might very well have seen something first in the
                    newspaper because it was still uncertain, and they would have to send in
                    something that said, “It has been alleged that . . .” or “It has been reported
                    that . . .” or “There is an unconfirmed account of . . .” We would try to hold
                    it until we could confirm it one way or another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have a particular line or policy that we were
                        doing, or was it just trying to keep . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: To keep the Russians out. It was a very Cold War policy. Lumumba was
                    not necessarily considered to be a Communist or anything, but he was considered
                    to be very unstable, and nobody was really quite sure what he was going to do,
                    and the big thing that one wanted to avoid was to have him create an opening for
                    the Russians. The U.S. was not prepared to bring in its own forces, but the UN
                    force was seen as a way of providing stability and precluding Russian
                    intrusion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We felt this was a very serious possibility at the

                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Oh, yes. This was very much a Cold War approach in Washington. It
                    shines through The Congo Cables; it shines through other books that have been
                    written about Kennedy policy in Africa in that era.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the situation sort of settled down, if you could
                        call it that, I mean it's a turbulent time, what were you doing for the
                        remainder of the time that you were there until '62?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Once the UN force had come in and there had been at least a restoration
                    of law and order, there was still constant political turmoil. I went back and
                    forth. I was not only an economic officer. When I went out there to a consulate
                    general, I would have been the economic officer but in a junior position, but
                    with an embassy, a more senior economic officer was brought in, an economic
                    counselor and a mid-level officer. So I became the number three in a three-man
                    section. Because there were three economic officers in a very uncertain economy,
                    I tended to be a float. I spent a lot of time doing political reporting plus
                    some economic work. So I did a fascinating mixture of things. I wound up the
                    principal political section contact with several of the Belgians who had
                    remained on as counselors. One at the presidency and one at the foreign ministry
                    became good friends, and they were invaluable sources, and I used to see them on
                    a regular basis and feed their information into political calculus.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view, again at the time, the situation when
                        Lumumba was killed and all? Was this a good thing from the embassy point of
                        view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: The embassy's response, I think, was a sense of great relief. Lumumba
                    was looked on by the embassy as a loose cannon on the deck, as the one man who
                    could rally serious opposition to the relatively moderate government that we
                    wanted to see installed. At the time Lumumba was killed, there was an interim
                    government in place which we had been supporting. It was a few months before the
                    summit which produced the Adoula government, but clearly as long as Lumumba was
                    alive, he was the logical man around whom a number of Congolese would be likely
                    to rally. With Lumumba out of the way, there was no clear successor, and it made
                    the situation easier, if you will, to manipulate. So I think the removal of
                    Lumumba, whom we did not trust, was regarded as essentially a helpful thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about our feeling toward the separatist movements that
                        were developing in the Congo? Did we have a strong feeling about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: We were consistently opposed to the Katanga and Kasai separatists.
                    Those were the two movements at the time, and our policy was consistent in
                    opposition to Tshombe in Katanga and to Kalonji in Kasai particularly once the
                    UN force was in place. It took us a little while and it took the UN a little
                    while to really exercise their mandate strongly enough to end the
                    secessions.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I think we might move on. As I say, in terms of the political
                    atmosphere at the time, I found Madeline Kalb to be an excellent source for
                    anyone who wants to get a sense of how the embassy was responding. Since she has
                    gone back through the documents, she's going to be much more accurate than
                    anybody whose memory is 30-years cloudy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Yes, but she has a lot of that, interestingly because she also did a
                    great deal of interviewing, but her interviewing was aided by the fact that she
                    had just read all the documents and could come back with much more specific
                    points.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then we move to your next assignment, which was Benghazi
                        in Libya. Now what was the situation because the capitals of Libya,
                        particularly in those days, were rather obscure. Things moved back and forth
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Constitutionally Libya had two capitals, Tripoli and Benghazi, and the
                    government was supposed to shift back and forth at two-year intervals. King
                    Idris had created a third capital at Baida up in the Jebel Akhdar, the
                    Cyrenaican hills, which was originally called the “Summer Capital.” But it was
                    his favorite place because it was his homeland. He began shifting some of the
                    government functions up to Baida which became de facto the alternate capital
                    rather than Benghazi. So about 1964, when we left, the government functions were
                    pretty much split between Baida and Benghazi. In fact, the U.S. recognized the
                    de facto situation by downgrading the embassy office in Benghazi to a consulate
                    and creating an embassy office in Baida.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were you doing then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I went out to Benghazi which, at the time, was the capital. It was the
                    principal embassy office with the ambassador in residence when I arrived. I went
                    out as economic officer in Benghazi. I was originally assigned to Tripoli. It
                    was supposed to be sort of a reward after the Congo. It was a fairly modern
                    place with good facilities, a big air base, a commissary, a PX and all the rest.
                    But the senior economic officer who was supposed to stay and be with the embassy
                    in Benghazi decided that he really wanted to be in Tripoli. That's where the oil
                    headquarters were and that's where he ought to be. So my assignment got
                    flip-flopped and suddenly it became Benghazi which was not nearly the same kind
                    of reward because it's really a backwater. But it was a quiet place. It turned
                    out professionally to be useful because when the post was downgraded to a
                    consulate, most of the embassy staff moved off to Tripoli, and I wound up as
                    principal officer. So I was economic officer for one year and principal officer
                    for one year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what were your principal responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: As economic officer the principal job was really keeping track of the
                    developing oil industry. We got out there in 1962; Libya had pumped its first
                    oil the year before. The major discoveries in Zelten had come in 1959. They were
                    just starting to pump, and we were trying to get some reasonable projections for
                    the future growth of oil exports, how much oil was Libya going to be able to
                    pump, what would this mean to the international oil market, what would it mean
                    for Libya's own economy. The senior economic officer in Tripoli was getting
                    official projections from the oil company officials with whom he played
                    golf.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Whenever I went out in the fields or went down to the ports and talked to the
                    guys on the rigs or who were setting up the pumping stations, I always came up
                    with different numbers, much more optimistic numbers. The senior officials would
                    tell the senior economic officer in Tripoli that they were going to double
                    production in the next three years, and I would go down to the port and they
                    were building separators capable of handling ten times the production. It was
                    obvious that he was getting low figures. So I kept working out different
                    figures, and it was very useful because the information I was getting out of the
                    working level turned out to be much more accurate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any reason for giving low figures?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I think they were just being terribly cautious. Maybe they were afraid
                    their figures would get back to the Libyan government which would expect greater
                    revenues from them. I don't know what their motivation was because these were
                    people I didn't meet, he did. All I knew was that I was getting straight stories
                    from guys in the field who didn't have political concerns and were just telling
                    what they were building. It was a fascinating process. Other than that there was
                    a limited amount of commercial-type work, market surveys, contacts and the
                    like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the contacts with the Libyans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: They were pretty limited. I must say, after being in the Congo where
                    the people were really great fun—there weren't that many highly educated
                    Congolese, but the Congolese we knew were alive at least—we found the Libyans to
                    be a very introverted group. One limitation was, of course, I didn't speak
                    Arabic. I learned enough to get directions, but that was about the limit. But
                    most of the Libyans we met we found generally a less interesting group with few
                    exceptions—an opposition parliamentarian, a couple of business people. They had
                    very little sense of humor, took themselves very seriously, not our cup of
                    tea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To move on, you came back to Washington in 1964, and you
                        spent five years there in a very interesting position. Could you tell me
                        what your assignments were there and then we'll talk about some of
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: All right. Two years in the Bureau of African Affairs in a newly
                    created position, really. It was the Office of Inter-African Affairs. I was the
                    first OAU desk officer. The Organization of African Unity had been created in
                    1963, and the Bureau decided they wanted somebody to spend a little time
                    figuring out what it was about, what it was going to do and to keep track of it.
                    So I did the first basic study of the OAU, a piece for publication. In fact, it
                    was in the “Background Note Series.” It was not on a country, it was on an
                    organization. I tried to track what the OAU was up to. Since this was
                    Inter-African Affairs, we did a little bit of everything. We did all the primary
                    studies, for example, on Rhodesian UDI (Unilateral Declaration of Independence)
                    in 1965. Our office was tasked with looking at the consequences in southern
                    Africa and what it would be. I remember spending Thanksgiving weekend cramming
                    papers on UDI. So it was a very varied sort of assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel sort of the initial enthusiasm over the
                        independence of Africa which came out particularly when Kennedy came into
                        power and all? I mean, this was a rather exciting period of time. This had
                        begin to die down, hadn't it? And sort of the realities and the problems of
                        Africa began.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Yes, there was a fading. It's interesting because I think people looked
                    on the OAU possibly as a way for Africa to deal with some of its own problems. I
                    think that's why there was a new concentration on the organization and interest
                    in studying it more closely and watching its evolution. We were always looking
                    for new signs of hope.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To get some of the spirit, we were really hoping for
                        things to work out there. Had the concern about the Soviet menace given way
                        to a feel for this is a new area of putting things together and it's in our
                        interest to see solid developments or were we still really concerned with
                        the Soviet problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I think you had what you've had ever since in dealing with Africa, the
                    debate between the globalists and the regionalists, people who said, “You've got
                    to look at Africa as an area with problems that need to be dealt with as African
                    problems. You've got to concentrate on development. Forget about the Soviets.
                    They're not going to make much difference in Africa.” Then you have the
                    globalists who said, “There is no area of the world that is insulated from the
                    U.S.-Soviet competition. You've got to look at Africa as another arena in which
                    we are locked in mortal combat with the evil foe of Communism.” These are
                    extreme positions. There's always been this tension, and policy has always been
                    the result of a pulling and hauling between these two groups. So you always have
                    something in between. You always have some attention to the U.S.-Soviet
                    competition, and you always have a great deal of concern for the legitimate
                    development of Africa in and of itself.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>We have gone back and forth between the two poles over the years. Certainly in
                    the early Kennedy years we were being very much the Cold Warrior. There was the
                    Kennedy enthusiasm that, “We've got to help these newly independent countries in
                    the best American tradition,” but underlying it in the Kennedy years certainly
                    was the sense that one of the reasons why we have to do it is because we've got
                    to keep the Russians out. And you've always had the mix, and it's not been a
                    Democratic-Republican split, it's been partly circumstance. But you're right, by
                    the mid-'60s some of the initial idealism, idealist surge—the feeling that Soapy
                    Williams certainly represented, if you will, that we've got to help Africa for
                    its own sake—had begun to fade. But from the beginning, other people in the
                    Kennedy entourage were more globalist. [Telephone Interruption] But as I say, I
                    think we were still looking for signs of hope. We still wanted to be idealistic
                    to the extent that we could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was your attitude towards Africa? Where did you
                        fall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I was still fascinated by Africa. I guess I probably fell somewhere in
                    the middle. I wasn't yet at the level where I was thinking as globally as one
                    should. I was dealing with problems as they came. But I still remember during
                    that period getting a sense of how important Africa might or might not be when
                    there was a coup in Dahomey, the first or second or third coup in Dahomey which
                    was suffering coups. And I bumped into a friend who was at the time the
                    Secretary of State's staff assistant. We were all excited about the coup in
                    Dahomey, and I said, “What did the Secretary think about the coup in
                    Dahomey?”</p>
                <p>And the answer was, “He took note of it.” Clearly for the Secretary of State, the
                    second or third coup in Dahomey was not going to be more than a blip on his
                    radar screen even for a secretary like Dean Rusk who read voluminously. I mean,
                    he would have taken note of it because he read an enormous amount and tried to
                    keep informed about what was going on, but it was not going to really occupy his
                    attention for very long. He was not going to have to do anything about it. There
                    were other problems which were clearly much more important for him.</p>

                <p>STEIGMAN: In '66 I moved to be staff assistant to the Secretary. Dean Rusk had a
                    very small staff. He essentially had retained the habits of the military staff
                    officer, and he had a special assistant and a staff assistant who screened all
                    the paper for him, paper going in and paper going out. Our job was to know what
                    he was interested in, what he was working on, what decisions he had to take as
                    an indication of his interests, make sure he saw what he needed to know and was
                    spared what he didn't need. It was a fascinating overview of the foreign policy
                    process, a sense of the way the foreign policy priorities look from the
                    perspective of the Secretary of State.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is '66 to '69 and certainly a period where Vietnam
                        was very much on—was this sort of our of your hands. I mean, was that dealt
                        with elsewhere, or did you get involved with the Vietnam process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: It's interesting. We got involved in everything in a sense that we
                    moved material on every subject to and from the Secretary. The first thing that
                    was on top of his stack every morning was the intelligence summary dealing with
                    Vietnam, and the things he always wanted to see was what were the bombing
                    missions that had been carried out, what were the casualties, what was the
                    general military situation. He followed it very, very closely. He had been a
                    military staff officer, and I think that was part of the reason he was
                    interested in following the military detail. But we were not involved in the
                    policy sense in anything that went on. We were conduits. He did not use his
                    immediate staff to help shape policy in any way. He dealt directly with the
                    assistant secretaries unlike other secretaries of state who have tended to work
                    with a very small immediate staff in making policy decisions. We were really
                    just the channels. We really provided a truly staff rather than line
                    function.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, could you give an idea, again purely from your
                        viewpoint, of the type of person, as you saw him, what Dean Rusk was like?
                        I'm speaking both personally and as a working man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: He was a workaholic, for one thing. This was a man who worked 70 or 80
                    hours a week, who was probably the best informed Secretary of State in terms of
                    the volume of material he devoured on what was going on in the world, a
                    remarkable stylist, great craftsman of the English language, a man who at 11:00
                    at night could sit in a hotel room overseas, or usually in the guest room of an
                    ambassadorial residence, and dictate an absolutely flawless telegram to the
                    President on major discussions that he had during the day with other world
                    leaders, which simply came out of his mind in complete paragraphs that he never
                    had to look at or re-edit, that we could send off after he had gone off to bed
                    and we knew it would be fine. He knew it would be fine. He just had a great
                    command of the language and a great command of his material.</p>
                <p>Personally he was a delight to be with. He was a total gentleman, very
                    thoughtful, always concerned about the people who worked for him, never angry,
                    never harsh. As a Secretary of State, I find him very hard to judge. He was
                    totally loyal to the President, again, very much in that military tradition, has
                    never written about the advice he gave to the President, has never discussed it,
                    has always said, “That was between me and the President,” loyally supported
                    whatever policy emerged, and I never knew, working with him very closely for two
                    years, spending long hours on airplanes with him playing bridge, I never knew
                    whether he personally agreed or disagreed with any aspect of the policy that he
                    was espousing, defending, implementing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of any particular moments which you observed
                        or were concerned with particularly in dealing with things that were
                        happening around the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Lots of things happened in those two years. I remember the Secretary
                    coming back after dinner in black tie at 11:00 one night when the Greek colonels
                    had staged their coup. I remember playing bridge with the Secretary for 14 hours
                    nonstop.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would be 1967.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: April 22, 1967.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: You were involved with that, I gather.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, actually I was in Yugoslavia, but I later served in
                        Greece, and April 22, 1967 was emblazoned across walls all the time. This
                        was the phoenix.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Okay. That was the date. I couldn't have told you the date, but that's
                    the date. I remember him coming back and sitting in the office, and we were
                    there until 2:00 in the morning dealing with the spill off and what was
                    happening and what to do about it with assistant secretaries coming and going. I
                    remember sitting on airplanes with him from Hawaii to Washington, playing bridge
                    nonstop from the time we took off until the time we landed. He loved to play
                    bridge. That was his favorite form of relaxation. He basically didn't like
                    airplanes. He had flown over the hump too many times in a DC-3 during World War
                    II to be particularly fond of air travel. What he liked to do on an airplane was
                    either play bridge or sleep, mostly play bridge. That wasn't, interestingly
                    enough, one of the things that I was asked before I was picked for the job,
                    whether I played bridge, but once I got the job I was asked whether I played
                    bridge, and I think he was very pleased that the answer was yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever get the feeling that certain things he wanted
                        to know, you mentioned military, but how about other things? I've heard it
                        said in other interviews that he was always interested in what happened, but
                        basically he was focused on the Far East more than, I'll say, European
                        affairs. Did you have any feel that this was a Latin American affair or an
                        African affair, and he's not as interested in that as something that would
                        happen, say, in Thailand or of that nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Well, it's inevitably true for any Secretary of State, though, and it's
                    true for the United States as a whole. The foreign policy mechanism can only
                    focus on one or two areas at a time, and the U.S. has its priorities. The first
                    priority is the U.S.-Soviet relationship, the second priorities are the Far East
                    and western Europe, then you spill off to Latin America and the Middle East, and
                    then you get Africa and South Asia which are normally the last priorities. But
                    that's always been true. And certainly during the Vietnam War, Rusk's primary
                    focus had to be on Vietnam because that's what he was being questioned on
                    constantly on Capitol Hill and in public appearances. He had to be thoroughly
                    informed. He had to be concerned with Europe. Vietnam was even a subject
                    inevitably in NATO consultations. But he had to keep up because he went to NATO
                    twice a year. He saw NATO foreign ministers all the time. He had to be very well
                    briefed on what was going on in Europe. He certainly had to be kept thoroughly
                    up to date on the U.S.-Soviet relationship. After that it depended on whether
                    there was a crisis in the area or not or a major policy decision that demanded
                    his immediate attention. Otherwise, on things like most developments in Latin
                    America and most developments in Africa, he probably would rely largely on the
                    daily summaries. We would not give him very much backup traffic on areas unless
                    we knew that he was going to deal with it.</p>
                <p>If, for example, we knew he was getting ready to go down to Uruguay to Punta del
                    Este with President Johnson for a Hemispheric Conference, for a few weeks before
                    that we would give him a much heavier dose of traffic from all Latin American
                    capitals so he would feel more comfortable when he got down there knowing what
                    was going on in each of the countries whose foreign ministers he would be
                    meeting. He would also get briefing books, but we would give him the current
                    traffic. When he got back from that, we would probably cut off most of it
                    because his focus would have to shift to something else. If we were giving him
                    too much of something or not enough of something, he would let us know. But our
                    job was to try to anticipate his needs and be sure that he was well
                    prepared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, within the staff around him that you were able to
                        observe, was there a feeling of optimism or it was just a job and about

                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Oh, there was a general pessimism. We felt that this was a no-win
                    situation. Most of us felt that the policy was not really going to work very
                    well. He was very persuasive at defending it, and if you listened to his
                    speeches often enough, you could almost come to believe it. But then you'd read
                    the cables, and you'd see what was going on. We'd talk among ourselves and we
                    generally sounded discouraged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shall we move on then to Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Sure.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Paris as a political officer from 1969-72.
                        What were your responsibilities there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: There was a year in between, by the way, just to clear the record. I
                    was a Congressional Fellow for one year before going off to Paris. I went to
                    Paris by accident, by the way. I was really supposed to go to Brussels as a
                    political military officer, but the position was abolished in one of these
                    budgetary cuts, and I was in need of a job when Bob Oakley, who was then in the
                    Paris slot, was asked by Charlie Yost to leave Paris a year early and join his
                    staff as the Middle East guy at the UN. So that position suddenly opened up, I
                    needed a job and the timing was right. It was the Africa-Middle East slot in the
                    political section. The political section in Paris had an internal and an
                    external unit. The external unit was essentially regional specialists, one for
                    Far East, one for Middle East-Africa and a couple for Europe, and I was the
                    Middle East-Africa man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again we're talking about '69 to '72. What was your
                        impression of the French role? Let's talk about the Middle East. The
                        American attitude has often been that the French were sort of a wild card in
                        certain areas including the Middle East.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: They were very much a wild card at that point. The French position, as
                    we saw it from Paris, was that they wanted to be sure that they continued to
                    play a role in any decisions that were taken on the future shape of the Middle
                    East. The French had traditionally been a Middle Eastern power, and they really
                    didn't want to be treated as irrelevant.</p>
                <p>The U.S. position at that point was to try to keep the French involved so that
                    they would not become a wild card. There was a regular four-power consultation
                    going on in New York among the permanent representatives to the UN. There was
                    also bilateral consultation going on between Joe Sisco, who was then Assistant
                    Secretary, and the French ambassador—I think it was Lucet at the time—who would
                    meet fairly regularly. I tried to keep up a parallel dialogue in Paris with the
                    Deputy Director for Middle East at the Quai d'Orsay, first Luc de Nanteuil and
                    then Fernand Rouillon. And we had quite frank exchanges paralleling the
                    Sisco-Lucet exchanges. Joe Sisco tended to edit his cables. Somebody would take
                    notes on the meetings with Lucet, they would come back to him, and he would
                    presumably do some editing to make sure that they reflected what he wanted to
                    convey.</p>
                <p>When the cables would come out, one was never sure whether Joe had done any
                    editing on them or to what extent he had done any editing on them. We would play
                    it safe. I would take a copy of the Sisco reporting cable, minus the comments,
                    over to the Quai and Nanteuil and I would swap cables. I would show him Sisco's
                    cables, and he would give me Lucet's version minus comments.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You teach diplomatic history, and the whole idea is that
                        you come out of a meeting . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Both sides understanding clearly what has been said or what has been
                    intended. This was a very useful device because I would read the Lucet cable and
                    comment on it, and he would read the Sisco cable and comment on it. We didn't
                    leave text with each other. We just read them and then retrieved the text since
                    they were all top secret, God knows why. But it was very useful because there
                    was several times when either Lucet, who was fluent in English but that was his
                    second language, had misconstrued something Sisco had said, or Sisco had not
                    intended what he said and had edited his cable to reflect what he intended. It
                    was very important that there be no misunderstanding. To our mind, that was the
                    surest way of guaranteeing that there were no misunderstandings on the French
                    side what Sisco wanted to convey.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: You have to have a very good working relationship to make this
                    possible. Fortunately, this was in the immediate post-De Gaulle years. It would
                    not have been possible two or three years earlier when the relations between the
                    embassy and the Quai were much more formal and correct. We had really good
                    personal relations. I worked with either five or six sous-directeurs at the Quai
                    because I had a tremendous geographic spread, and I really knew them all very
                    well. It was fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we see the French role in the Middle East, your
                        impression of the French role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Well, the French really were not playing a major role at that point. My
                    impression was what we really wanted was to keep them on the team to make sure
                    that they were a part of a joint effort and did not go off on their own and to
                    do anything independent as a wild card. That struck me as the real purpose of
                    the whole thing. At one point, for example, when the U.S. proposed to
                    temporarily suspend the four-power consultations in New York, something was
                    going on and I don't remember what the reason was, but that was sufficiently
                    important that it was something that the ambassador was asked to convey to the
                    Foreign Minister, not something for me to do at the lower level, but to convey
                    to the Foreign Minister and explain that this was a temporary suspension. The
                    reason I remember it so graphically is because the Foreign Minister, Maurice
                    Schumann, misunderstood what the ambassador had said. This was Arthur K. Watson,
                    who was not the swiftest of ambassadors, anyway, and Schumann misconstrued what
                    Watson said, and thought we were proposing to abolish the four-power
                    consultations. I could see from his reaction that he was reacting too strongly.
                    When he asked a clarifying question, the ambassador didn't catch the import of
                    the clarifying question and reinforced the mistaken notion in Schumann's mind. I
                    scribbled a little note and handed it to the ambassador and said, “He thinks
                    we're ending this not suspending it. You've got to clarify.” So Watson then
                    clarified and Schumann said, “Oh, that's entirely different! That's an entirely
                    different matter!” But the importance of it is indicated by the fact that the
                    instruction to the ambassador was to explain to the Foreign Minister that we
                    were suspending this so that there would be no hurt feelings. There was a real
                    concern to keep the French on board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now in Africa I assume the situation was quite
                        different. In fact, we were delighted the French had their area of
                        responsibility and we didn't have to worry about that. Was that the
                        attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Yes, the general attitude was very much one that we wanted to have the
                    French stay there. One of the things that we were constantly trying to—this went
                    on as well when I got to Gabon—was to reassure the French that we had no
                    intention or desire to replace them anywhere in Francophone Africa, that we
                    were, as you say, delighted to see them there and encouraged them to maintain
                    their presence and to increase their assistance in Africa. Again, there was
                    very, very close cooperation and very good exchanges. We used to exchange a lot
                    of information. We tended to have better information very often on what was
                    going on in Anglophone Africa, where we put more attention, and I used to do an
                    awful lot of information exchange with the French.</p>
                <p>I would drop in on my French counterparts and bring them up to date on whatever I
                    picked up from embassy reporting repeated to Paris to supplement what they were
                    getting on areas of interest to them. I would ask them questions. We'd get
                    cables out of the Francophone posts repeated to Paris, and I would go in and get
                    the Quai's comments on what was going on, how did they see what was being
                    reported.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an aspect of diplomacy that's been all but lost
                        and that is the exchange between diplomats of information that they are
                        getting, not only close allies but ones that are maybe not just allies but
                        on basically friendly terms.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: You've got to do a lot of trading. Information is a commodity, and by
                    and large information is either bought or bartered. Since overt diplomats don't
                    buy information, you generally get it by barter. You barter something for it.
                    You may barter friendship. You may barter hospitality. You may barter
                    information. And if you're dealing with somebody whom you can trust with some of
                    your information, the easiest way to do it is just a nice professional
                    information exchange from which both sides come out richer. As long as you're
                    not compromising your own national interests or doing damage to any of your own
                    national programs, that's an ideal way to operate and it worked extremely well
                    in Paris.</p>
                <p>I say it would not have been possible two or three years earlier because the
                    French would not have given any information so there would have been no reason
                    for us to give them any. But with the post-de Gaulle opening, the French were
                    willing to talk to us. I assume that David Newsom has been one of your
                    interviewees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, not yet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Because David, who was then Assistant Secretary for African Affairs,
                    used to come to Paris once or twice a year. We would do a two-day, all-day
                    session with the French on Africa, and it was wonderful. We would have an agenda
                    worked out in advance, and we would go over all of Africa, an hour and a half,
                    two hours per area, per chunk of Africa with an agreement as to which side would
                    lead on each subject. We would give an appraisal of how we saw what was going
                    on, what the current developments were; then the other side would comment what
                    it's information was, and then there would just be an exchange of impressions
                    and views as to what was going on and what we might do about it constructively
                    from both sides, were the French planning to do something more in this area of
                    concern to us, could we encourage them to do some more. It was really quite a
                    frank exchange, and it worked very well because David has pretty good French,
                    and the ground rule was each side spoke in its own language. I mean, everybody
                    was reasonably bilingual but most comfortable speaking in his own language.
                    David had no problem following and understanding the French and, in fact, he
                    sometimes responded in French. But mostly he would make his presentations in
                    English and they would make their presentations in French and the discussions
                    would then tend to go back and forth after that. But these were very good open
                    discussions.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>We did this occasionally on Near East as well, not to the same extent and not as
                    formally because Joe Sisco never was willing to give the French that much time.
                    He didn't take the French that seriously. In the Middle East, as I say, he
                    regarded them as a loose cannon to be sort of patted on the head and say,
                    “There, there. You just stick with us, guys.” He wasn't going to give them that
                    kind of time. In fact, once when he was in transit in Paris, I got him to agree
                    to spend an hour in the lounge of the airport with Luc de Nanteuil. Luc and I
                    went out to the airport and he and Joe spent an hour in the airport exchanging
                    views in the VIP lounge. But it was harder to get Joe to come into town.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shall we go to Nigeria now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were assigned, obviously moving up in the area, as a
                        political counselor which is the equivalent to the top political reporter in
                        Nigeria in 1972-75. Could you describe the situation in Nigeria at that
                        time? It was, again, a rather important period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: It was a very quiet period. It was the post-Biafra period. The war had
                    been over for two years. Nigeria was still under military rule. It was the Gowon
                    regime. It was a period, by and large, of political stability. There were no
                    civilian politics. We were essentially watching the administrative development
                    of Nigeria. We were looking at the civilian institutions that were permitted
                    like trade unions and other groups. We were talking to the people in the
                    military regime to try to get a sense of where they were going. It was not a
                    period of high political activity or heavy reporting responsibilities for a
                    political section. We were trying to do some longer-term appraisals. We were
                    trying to look at where Nigeria might be headed. John Reinhardt was the
                    ambassador, and with his encouragement, we did a long piece trying to analyze
                    the way the Nigerians look at the world, the Nigerian outlook, the Nigerian
                    political outlook based on extensive interviews and research and input from the
                    whole embassy to try to provide a framework for political analysis. We were able
                    to do that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In brief, how would you say the Nigerians looked at the
                        world at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: As a series of concentric circles. They were primarily concerned, as
                    most countries are, with their internal development, if you will, a certain
                    amount of gazing at one's own navel, their immediate neighbors, then the rest of
                    Africa and only after the problems of Africa were dealt with did they then look
                    beyond. Even then, there are just a couple of countries in the world that were
                    really of major importance to them, the U.S., the U.K., the OPEC countries and
                    the Soviet Union and peripherally China.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>But most of the rest of the world really didn't engage their very active
                    attention. Nigerians also have a wonderful mixture of arrogance and insecurity
                    which governed all their behavior and which had to be taken into account, very
                    self-assured on the surface but if you scratched deeply they had some real ego
                    problems. They really weren't that self-confident and you tended to get the
                    blustery or sharp reactions because they weren't sure how to react. It was an
                    interesting process of analysis. The political section had an awful lot of
                    business with the Nigerian government on foreign policy issues, on U.S.-Nigerian
                    relations. Much of what we were doing was the bilateral relationship and UN
                    issues and African issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they view the United States? You were in a period
                        of, really, fence-rebuilding, weren't you, after the Biafran War about which
                        there was a lot of resentment? Although we supported the central government,
                        there was a tremendous movement to help Biafra.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: There was a lot of pro-Biafra sentiment in the U.S. That stirred a
                    great deal of resentment in Nigeria. It was a period of fence building, but, by
                    and large, we had a very positive relationship with the Nigerians. We all had a
                    lot of Nigerian friends, and I never detected any basic hostility to any of the
                    embassy people because we were American. We had very good working
                    relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little bit about John Reinhardt as an
                        ambassador, how he operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: John's a consensus builder, at least as ambassador. I think he took
                    some tough decisions while he was at USIA, I gather, which offended people, but
                    within the embassy in Nigeria, he tried to avoid having to make people seriously
                    unhappy. He tried to avoid confrontation and to build consensus. He's fairly
                    low-key as ambassador.</p>
                <p>I remember, for example, I think John basically believed our AID mission was
                    overstuffed and overstaffed and given Nigeria's oil wells probably should be
                    phased down and have its program scaled back. He would smile benignly when I
                    would suggest things like this in staff meetings, and over time the AID mission
                    was scaled back, but I don't think he ever confronted the AID mission director
                    or pushed very hard himself for it. I think he may have had a feeling that this
                    was one of those things that was inevitable, it was going to happen, he didn't
                    have to get into a confrontation on it, and he was delighted when other people
                    pushed the process along. But the whole place had a fairly low-key
                    leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, as the political counselor, deal with Gowon who
                        was then the chief of state?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I met him a couple of times, but I never did business with him, no.
                    Nobody saw him very often. Even the ambassador didn't see him very often.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Politically though we saw this as a government in power
                        working without much of a challenge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: No, there was no external challenge to government. Our political
                    predictions were that this government was immune to external challenge, that the
                    challenge, if any, would come from within the military, and if one group within
                    the military decided it didn't like Gowon it probably could remove him fairly
                    easily—but that we would have probably no foreknowledge of this, no warning, and
                    we would simply report it when it happened. In fact, that's just about what
                    happened three weeks after we left. Gowon was away and he was replaced while he
                    was out of the country and he went back to school in England in exile. It was
                    peaceful, very Nigerian. I wasn't there at the time, but my guess is that it
                    came as a total surprise to the embassy when it happened unless somebody had
                    come around to the attach�s the day before and said, “By the way, just so you
                    know, it's going to be very bloodless. While Gowon is away, we're going to
                    replace him. We just wanted you guys to know so that you won't be upset, and
                    there won't be any change in policy.” They may have told them the day before,
                    they may not. But if they chose not to tell the embassy, the embassy was not
                    going to know it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any problem with Nigeria? Dealing with the
                        United Nations, this always has been one of our tasks of each embassy going
                        out and trying to get their delegate in a country to vote on a particular
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: We made our pitch. We would go and make our pitch every year on the UN
                    laundry list, but they voted their interests, not ours. The Nigerians couldn't
                    be bought or swayed away from what they thought was in their interest. We did
                    our best to persuade them. We would argue on certain points that this would
                    really be in their interest or that they had no particular reason or no Nigerian
                    national interest on this one, you know, could they please accommodate us,
                    things like the Puerto Rican decolonization issue. We'd say, “Now why do you
                    want to make the U.S. mad at you. For heaven's sakes, you have no real interest
                    on this one.” I don't even remember whether we won or lost. The Nigerians were
                    not unreasonable. The Nigerians were not flaming radicals. By African standards,
                    they are relatively conservative. They are a bunch of flaming capitalists and a
                    relatively conservative bunch at that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came two years after the Biafran War, and if you

                        Central Nigerian government comes over and from other interviews I
                        understand that you had the Jewish lobby which was using Biafra as a model
                        for what would happen to Israel, if the Arabs took over there would be a
                        blood bath. You had the Catholics and you had the Protestants, as well as
                        show biz, all pleading the cause of the Biafrans. So you much have been
                        monitoring the situation somewhat after this.</hi>

                <p>STEIGMAN: Oh, but this is two years later. Reconstruction had not taken place on
                    a large extent in the east. There were still blown bridges and the roads hadn't
                    been repaved, the Onitsha Market hadn't been rebuilt yet, but people were living
                    fairly peacefully, and there were Ibos all over Lagos again. We had good Ibo
                    friends . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that the Ibos weren't being discriminated
                        against two years later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Not visibly. I suspect that because there were fewer Ibos in senior
                    civil service positions they may have had a harder time getting government
                    contracts than they had enjoyed before. I'm sure there continued to be tribal
                    favoritism and certainly a great deal of corruption. But in terms of the way
                    people were living, we drove all through the east several times, and life seemed
                    to be flourishing again. As I say, the roads still had a lot of pot holes that
                    needed to be repaired. There were bridges that needed to be rebuilt. There were
                    markets that needed to be reconstructed. The flow of funds for reconstruction of
                    the east had been slow, but that did not mean that people were not living fairly
                    comfortably.</p>
                <p>I remember in Paris in early 1970 when the Ibo resistance collapsed. I remember
                    getting a phone call at the embassy from one of the French deputies who had been
                    very pro-Biafran saying, “The U.S. must intervene to save the lives of the
                    Biafrans. They're all going to be slaughtered.”</p>
                <p>I remember telling him on the phone, “Mr. Deputy, I'm reading telegrams from
                    Nigeria even as we speak, and I'm reading press reports from Nigeria even as we
                    speak, and it is clear that there is no genocide going on, that people are not
                    being killed, that the Nigerians are sending food in. It is just the contrary of
                    what you are saying.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, no,” he insisted. “That cannot be true. They will all be slaughtered. The
                    U.S. must act.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Mr. Deputy, we have no evidence to support your allegations. I'm sorry,
                    the U.S. cannot act on your allegations because the evidence is to the
                    contrary.” But people were really just wild for this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand one time Secretary Rusk told the Nigerian
                        desk officer, “Well, at least you've succeeded in having the Protestants,
                        the Catholics and the Jews all against our policy.” Well, then let's move to
                        your assignment to Gabon as ambassador. Now the ambassadorial assignment is
                        obviously a very important one within the Foreign Service. How did yours
                        come about? Was it logical progression or luck or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Certainly a logical progression but also clearly a certain amount of
                    luck. Very unexpected. We were in Nigeria getting ready to leave. I was looking
                    for a job. I was, in fact, trying to get a DCM job because I had never been a
                    DCM and that seemed to be the next logical step. I wanted a DCM job, and I also
                    wanted to get away from Africa. I wanted to vary my experience. I got a call
                    from Washington offering me a job on the Policy Planning Staff, and I negotiated
                    a little bit. They needed an Africa-type on the Policy Planning Staff. I said,
                    “Look, I'm really only interested in it if I can do something else besides
                    Africa. I don't mind doing some Africa, but I want to broaden my background a
                    little bit.” So that had been negotiated, and I thought was going back to the
                    Policy Planning Staff, and we had gone through this thing. A week later, I get a
                    second call from Nat Davis who was then Director General saying, “Any reason why
                    we should not put your name up as a candidate for ambassador of Gabon?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “But I thought I was going to Policy Planning Staff.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, yes. But any reason why we shouldn't put it up?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “My God! Are there any schools in Gabon? Are there any educational
                    facilities?” I said, “Can I call you back tomorrow? Let me go home and talk to
                    my family. My family's all set to go back to Washington. We've just gone through
                    getting the kids used to the idea of going home, and now all of a sudden we're
                    changing signals. Let me call you back.” So I called him back the next day and
                    we caucused and said, “We'd cope with the schools one way or another.” It was
                    not the sort of thing that you turn down. We caucused and I called back and
                    said, “Okay, yes, go ahead. Put the name up.” And I said, “Is this real? Do I
                    really have a chance for it?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Yeah.” He said, “Well, we can pretty well control it by the names
                    we put on the list. You're the candidate. They'll be a couple of other names on
                    the list, but we'll make clear that you'll be the candidate.” How it happened I
                    have no idea. Something happened in Washington, this is what came out and there
                    I was..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests in Gabon, if any?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: American investments, at that point, primarily in manganese
                    production.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about 1975-77.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Yes. U.S. Steel had half interest in the manganese, a major source of
                    manganese of considerable importance to the U.S., U.S. Steel at least. Oil,
                    which we were keeping tabs on very closely. Gabon was an OPEC member producing
                    about 230,000 barrels a day, very small production but prospects for more.
                    Because there was an oil boom it was likely to be, though small, an interesting
                    and attractive market. The country was going to be spending a fair amount of
                    money. Gabon was one of the most moderate and Western-oriented states in Africa
                    under fairly strong French influence but a state you could pretty well count on
                    to vote with you when you needed some help. It was decidedly secondary, however,
                    on the U.S. priority list. But, nonetheless, of sufficient interest to warrant
                    maintaining a dialogue, at least.</p>
                <p>It was interesting the year after we left, Bongo even became President of the OAU
                    for a year. Bongo was interested in diversifying and showing the French that he
                    wasn't 100% dependent on them without pushing them to the point where they would
                    cut off his subsidies. So he liked to use the Americans for that. That helped
                    keep the dialogue going. During the two years we were there, for example, we
                    started a small military assistance program in close collaboration with the
                    French to make sure that we didn't get their noses out of joint.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how was this done? Any fiddling with the military
                        obviously was diminishing the role of France.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Well, not really. They recognized what we were doing; in fact, and they
                    recognized this, they recognized that Bongo had to do some diversifying for his
                    own self-image. They would rather he diversified with us because we had a
                    regular dialogue doing, and we were basically trying to encourage them to
                    maintain their role. We kept reassuring them that we were not interested in
                    displacing them, that we were going to do this on a very modest basis. And we
                    weren't putting any personnel in. I mean, we were not a threat in the sense that
                    American personnel were not going to turn up, and the French were going to keep
                    running the show. First of all, we didn't have anybody who spoke French, for
                    Heaven's sakes, or hardly anybody to work on the military. So it was all done
                    very quietly. We kept the French fully informed of what we were doing both in
                    Gabon and in Paris, made sure their noses didn't get out of joint. Bongo didn't
                    want their noses out of joint, because he knew we weren't going to replace them.
                    We were never going to give them a new Corvette or two new airplanes or anything
                    like that. We had a $5 million-a-year program. It was small stuff.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any instructions when you went out or was it
                        just go out and do your best?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: One always starts with a basic set of U.S. policy guidelines for the
                    country which in the case of a place like Gabon basically was , “Keep them
                    friendly, keep them happy, keep them on our side.” I don't even remember if it
                    was in there specifically but certainly understood, “Don't get the French riled
                    up because we're not going to replace them. Don't raise expectations too high
                    because you're not going to get any major resources.” This was supposed to be a
                    low-key holding operation to the extent that if the Department did not have to
                    think about Gabon, you were a success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the embassy staff when you were there?
                        Was it an effective one or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Reasonably. It was a very small staff. I had three other State
                    Department officers, one USIA officer and a Peace Corps director. That was the
                    American staff plus two secretaries and two communicators. In fact, we went to a
                    third communicator because we became a relay point on communications. But,
                    otherwise, the American staff was minute. So it was probably fortunate we didn't
                    have an awful lot that had to be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your relations with the Gabonese government and
                        with President Bongo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Relations with Bongo were excellent, very, very good personal
                    relationship. The only way to get anything done in Gabon, obviously, was to go
                    see Bongo or call Bongo. I had a direct number. He gave me his direct phone
                    number so I could actually call up and get the President directly which I only
                    used, I think, a couple of times when I needed to get to him. But I could see
                    him whenever I wanted to. He would call up and ask me to come over. I probably
                    saw him about every couple of weeks and talked about everything under the sun.
                    He would sometimes have requests. We would just chat at times which was always
                    fun. I rather enjoyed it since he made all the real decisions. I mean, you could
                    talk to ministers about other things. We would go talk to the Foreign Ministry
                    once a year on the UN laundry list and things like that. But if you really cared
                    about a UN issue, you would go directly to the Foreign Minister, not anybody
                    under him, before you would go directly to Bongo. If it really, really mattered,
                    if Washington really cared about something, you knew that you had to see the
                    President. He was the only one who could pick up the phone and tell the guy in
                    New York to do something. Then you knew it would be done. If you left it to the
                    Foreign Ministry, it went through channels and if you sent a cable you had no
                    hope.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your relations with the French ambassador
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: The French ambassador was the second power in the country, Maurice
                    Delaunay, who had been there for 12 years and then had gone off to Madagascar
                    for a couple of years and then at Bongo's request had come back. He was really a
                    pro-consul in many ways. He was, for example, the only French ambassador who
                    commanded French troops and could, in fact, order them into action without
                    consulting Paris. But we got along very well, I'd say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't feel that you were an intrusion into his
                        turf?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: No, but one had to recognize this was the dean of the corps and a man
                    of great power and treat him with respect. That was fine. It was a very cordial
                    relationship. I certainly never assumed he was telling me everything that he
                    knew, but I felt we really had very little that would be secret from him,
                    anyway, so I could afford to be quite candid. I assumed that anything that we
                    did with the Gabonese he would find out about. So I figured I might as well get
                    the benefit of telling him myself. As a result, I think we developed a fairly
                    open relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular problems when you were there
                        that you had to deal with or was it a relatively tranquil time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: It was relatively tranquil. The problems were very petty ones. We had a
                    USIA third country national employee who was detained at the airport and not
                    allowed to enter. I had to get the President to spring him. It was one of these
                    weird ones. The man was a Haitian based in Morocco who repaired all the
                    audio-visual equipment and made a circuit twice a year to repair and service our
                    audio-visual equipment. Madame Bongo had had an amorous fling with a Haitian a
                    month before, and Bongo had ordered that all Haitians were to be banned from
                    Gabon. This guy showed up with a Haitian passport. So I called the head of the
                    S�ret�, who was the President's brother-in-law. He said he was sorry, he
                    couldn't do anything about it. The order had come from the President. I had to
                    talk to the President.</p>
                <p>So I called the President and said, “Mr. President, your brother-in-law says that
                    he can't do anything about this. We need this guy to come and fix our cameras.
                    Can he come in for just a few days? I guarantee he will leave then.”</p>
                <p>“All right, 72 hours.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Thank you, Mr. President.” And I called back. I said, “I just talked to
                    the President. He said he could come in for 72 hours. Would you like to confirm
                    it with him?”</p>

                <p>STEIGMAN: I was also credited to S�o Tom� and Principe, a former little

                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: They're both islands. No, you're thinking of Equatorial Guinea which is
                    split between the island and the mainland which was covered out of Cameroon on
                    and off and now is back to having its own embassy. But S�o Tom� and Principe are
                    so small that there's hardly any place to put an embassy. The total population
                    of the two islands is only about 100,000. They got their independence at the
                    beginning of July, 1975, just before I got out to Gabon.</p>
                <p>I missed, in fact, the delegation that went through for the formal independence
                    that was headed by Charlie Diggs, who was then Chairman of the House African
                    Affairs Subcommittee, who I gather behaved rather badly when he stopped over in
                    Libreville in the sense he was terribly arrogant and demanding as he tended to
                    be on trips.</p>
                <p>When I arrived, there was a delay in obtaining my credentials so that I could
                    start the process of presenting credentials. The Department put S�o Tom� on the
                    hit list because in their early days in the UN they voted against something we
                    cared about. Being very new to the business and very dependent on the advice of
                    the others, they had simply voted along with Angola and Mozambique. They voted
                    with the other Lusophones, and Angola and Mozambique tended not to vote the way
                    we wanted them to vote at that point. All of them having just come out of an
                    independence struggle, they tended to be anti-Western. The Sao Tomeans just
                    followed their lead. So we were mad at them, and I didn't get to present
                    credentials until, I think, the beginning of 1976. So we were doing it by
                    indirection. We were sending messages back and forth. They had a representative
                    in Libreville who could pass messages back and forth to them. Finally, it was
                    arranged for me to go over and present my credentials.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know, this brings up an interesting point. A UN
                        vote—we've got plenty of people voting against us—is it just easier to pick
                        on a small, an almost infinitesimal country than it is on a big
                        country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I would think it would be easier to behave negatively toward a small
                    country where the relationship isn't wildly important to you. There was
                    presumably an assumption in Washington that the relationship was going to be of
                    greater value to S�o Tom� than to us, and my assumption was that they wanted to
                    deliver a message to S�o Tom� that you could not with impunity thumb your nose
                    at the United States. There was a hit list around at that point. I can't
                    remember what the issue was. It was something we were exercised about at the UN
                    though.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably Israel or . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Oh, who knows?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: . . . also China at one point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: But they had a hit list and they simply added S�o Tom� to it fairly
                    early on as a country for which you weren't supposed to do particularly nice
                    things. We wouldn't have broken relations if we had them. But accrediting an
                    ambassador was considered a positive gesture, and they did not think that was
                    timely until emotions had cooled a little. So it was held up. When we finally
                    got over there, I must say, they are two of the most beautiful islands, at least
                    the main island of S�o Tom�. I never got to Principe. The only ambassador
                    accredited there who I know went to Principe was the French ambassador because
                    he had his own plane that would take him over and then could fly him up to
                    Principe. He had a French military aircraft.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>But at the time I was accredited there was still commercial service. Air Gabon
                    flew twice a week, and we went over there for three or four days, the time
                    between flights. They had a very nice ceremony. It was a rather colorful
                    ceremony in which the entire S�o Tomean army marched. All three platoons marched
                    up and down in front of the palace while I stood on a little soap box reviewing
                    the troops in the blazing sun. It must have been about 97 degrees. My wife and a
                    couple of embassy colleagues and my son were standing in the shade in the gate
                    behind me. The problem was I could hear them giggling as this went on and on and
                    I had to keep a straight face. The army band played the “Star Spangled Banner,”
                    and that occasioned some of the giggles because they kept hitting wrong notes.
                    Then they played the S�o Tomean national anthem which seemed interminable
                    because every time you thought it was about to end the music would sort of come
                    to a climax and then swoop upward and it would start again. And the sun beat
                    down, and, as I say, it was the giggles behind that were the most difficult. But
                    basically the S�o Tomeans were trying to put on an impressive ceremony within
                    their limited resources. And considering what they had available, they did. They
                    did it right. It was a very warm ceremony.</p>
                <p>The whole government was assembled inside for the little exchange of speeches,
                    and then I spent half an hour with the President, —I can see him, Miguel
                    Trovoada was the Prime Minister. The President is still there, da Costa, who is
                    a very bright man, spoke good French. He has a doctorate in economics from East
                    Berlin and has good French and German as well as Portuguese. French was the
                    working language because the center for their exile movement had been in
                    Libreville, so almost all the ministers had spent time in Gabon and all spoke
                    French, and that was the language in which we could do business since I didn't
                    have Portuguese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they allude to being frozen away from the United
                        States a while when you talked to them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: No, they were very, very cordial. I think I was the second ambassador
                    to present credentials after the French, so I was the third after the French and
                    Portuguese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So do you think they were even aware of the fact that we
                        were doing something to them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: No, probably not. They probably attributed it to bureaucratic slowness
                    on our part, if they thought about it at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So much for diplomatic lessons for somebody in the
                        corridors of power in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Yes, I don't think the message came across loud and clear by any means
                    particularly since it became obvious right from the start that we weren't coming
                    running in with any aid programs or anything else. They just wanted a cordial
                    relationship. They wanted to play in the big leagues and have normal diplomatic
                    relations with major powers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The fact that the President went to East Berlin to get a
                        degree, was this happenstance or was it a Marxist government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: It was Marxist in the sense that they tried to restructure the economy
                    toward state ownership. The mainstay of the economy prior to independence had
                    been large Portuguese-owned and -run plantations for coffee and cocoa. They were
                    nationalized, and there was an attempt make to run a sort of central Marxist
                    economy which didn't work very well. I gather they've shifted back to a great
                    degree of free enterprise though with some central control. With a country of
                    100,000 you're not talking about a very big economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. But we had no particular interest in the country for
                        any strategic purposes or anything of this nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Only the usual Washington concern that the other guys not get their
                    toehold. But, no, the country had no particular strategic value, no particular
                    mineral value, not even a good port.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About this time you were due to leave, was this . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Well, we weren't really necessarily due to leave. We were in Gabon just
                    over two years, about two years and three months, and left at my request because
                    we had problems, as so many Foreign Service officers do, with schools. We needed
                    schools for our kids. It was not an ideal time to leave because President Bongo
                    was about to become Chairman of the OAU for the next year, and it would have
                    been far more logical for me to have stayed on and presumably I would have
                    stayed had I not asked to be replaced. But I asked to go wherever there were
                    schools for the kids. One was at junior high level and the other the high school
                    level, and that was a pretty important time to get them into American schools.
                    So we asked to leave, and not surprisingly we wound up back in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You spent a year with the Senior Seminar?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I spent a year with the Senior Seminar. I was offered a couple of jobs
                    in the African Bureau office director jobs and I had said to them, “Look, I've
                    done nothing but Africa. I really would like to work on something else.” And, as
                    I mentioned, before we went to Gabon, I was supposed to go back to work in
                    Policy Planning with the assurance that the job would be only part Africa, and I
                    could also work on other issues. I really wanted to get some breadth. And I
                    said, “Please, I really don't want to come back into the African Bureau. I don't
                    want to come back as Director for Central Africa. I've just finished two years
                    in Central Africa. I don't want to come back as Director of AFI. I've been in
                    AFI before. I really would like to work somewhere else in the Department on
                    other issues.” They couldn't figure out what to do with me.</p>
                <p>So they offered me the seminar for a year, which was great fun. I learned an
                    awful lot about the U.S. in the seminar. I learned about fascinating things like
                    arms control problems and alternate energy. When I read articles in the paper
                    these days about fusion, I have some idea of what they're talking about. But
                    that came out of the senior seminar. I learned about everything, from riding
                    with police in the north side of Chicago to talking with fishermen in New
                    Bedford. It was most valuable in learning about this country, and since we had
                    been overseas for eight years, it was a wonderful re-Americanization. But I
                    don't think the Department gets very much value out of it.</p>
                <p>My own sense is that it provides the Department relatively little return except
                    in so far as it broadens a dozen or so senior State Department officers each
                    year and permits them to interact with colleagues from other agencies. But I
                    think it's a high price to pay for it, if you consider the salary costs involved
                    for the officers. On the other hand, if you don't have any other jobs for 12 or
                    13 officers, that's probably a constructive way to use them, and basically they
                    couldn't figure out what else to do with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then I suppose that, maybe, there was, you might
                        say, almost the rest factor which is not inconsiderable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I found my senior seminar year also gave me a lot to draw
                        on about the United States, and I think it was useful later on with normal
                        representation abroad. Well, after that . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: After that, I was detailed to the intelligence community staff. The
                    Department had suggested my name to Stan Turner, who was the Director of Central
                    Intelligence, for something they were setting up called the National
                    Intelligence Tasking Office. Turner was concerned that the intelligence
                    collection effort of the entire intelligence community was badly coordinated,
                    that in fact individual agencies to a great degree set their own priorities as
                    to what should be collected, and he wanted a central mechanism that could try to
                    coordinate it so that all agencies would direct resources toward targets that
                    were of particular priority importance to the Director of Central Intelligence
                    and to the policy planners who expressed their views to him. He got an Executive
                    Order from President Carter setting up the National Intelligence Tasking Office.
                    He created a Deputy Director for Collection within the intelligence community
                    staff, and under that Deputy Director he set up the National Intelligence
                    Tasking Office.</p>
                <p>I was asked if I would be willing to head that. Essentially they wanted a
                    neutral. They did not want a professional intelligence officer because of the
                    rivalries among the major components of the intelligence community: Central
                    Intelligence, the military services, DIA and National Security Agency. To get
                    somebody in from the State Department who was essentially not a part of the
                    community meant that they had a neutral who could go around without being
                    accused to trying to aggrandize his own agency.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting exercise. It was the first time I ever had a chance to
                    create an organization, to hire all the staff, to figure out how we could fulfil
                    this mandate. We never were able to exercise effective coordination because that
                    kind of authority was never really given to us. What we did put into place were
                    mechanisms to tell the Director of Central Intelligence on very short notice
                    what resources were available against targets of particular interest, if there
                    was a crisis in a particular area and there were reports of military movements.
                    The question was, what could the various agencies actually hope to collect on
                    that subject in the immediate future if their resources were retargeted, and
                    what would the costs be of retargeting those resources.</p>
                <p>We developed a mechanism that within 24 hours, really, we could get that
                    information. We could pull that together from the whole community and get it to
                    the Director. That mechanism had never existed before. Then he could then make a
                    decision as to whether to instruct the agencies to go after this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously this is an unclassified interview, but I wonder
                        if you could talk a little bit about here you are the outsider and one of
                        the most important commodities that the entire executive apparatus has is
                        intelligence. You've got all these different people collecting including the
                        FBI, the various defense agencies, the National Security Agency, and on and
                        on. What are some of the motivations that you saw from some of these people,
                        both rivalries and those of cooperation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: By and large, they worked pretty well together when it came to
                    addressing national priorities. But they all had their turf. I mean, they were
                    very jealous of doing what they did, and each one felt that it did very well
                    what it was charged with doing, did, and it didn't want other people poaching on
                    its turf. NSA was very jealous about the communications business. They were the
                    principal source clearly, as everybody knows, of communications intercepts and
                    of the intelligence derived from communications.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, they were also jealous, however, of CIA and DIA which were
                    able to do analysis based on information from a variety of sources. CIA and DIA,
                    in turn, didn't want NSA trying to do too much analysis because they said,
                    “Look, all you guys are supposed to be working with is communications
                    intercepts, and analysis based only on a single source is likely to be
                    misleading. You should not be in the analysis business. You should be
                    collectors, and you should be passing on your raw intelligence data to the
                    people who can do an all-source analysis.” So you would get that kind of
                    rivalry.</p>
                <p>Within CIA you had, of course, rivalry between the operations people and the
                    analytical people; that is, the collectors and the analyzers, again very jealous
                    of their turf. The operations people liked to tell you what the information they
                    collected meant. But, again, they were single source. They were dealing with
                    human intelligence, human source.</p>
                <p>My own impression is that of the analytical capabilities within the community,
                    CIA and State had the best. CIA obviously had the advantage of having a massive
                    analytical setup. They had a lot of people in each area, so they could do the
                    sort of in-depth analysis that was a luxury, by and large, at State where INR is
                    a small operation. But in terms of quality and political timeliness and
                    thoughtfulness, the INR product very often matches that of the Agency. In fact,
                    I thought INR's morning summary, by and large, was a better one than CIA's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe you wouldn't have run across the same problem
                        because it was a different setup. But I was in Athens, and we would have the
                        country team meeting. It was a time when the colonels were there, and it was
                        a difficult period. The political officer would speak and give her
                        interpretation. Then the station chief from CIA would say, “Well, we have
                        other intelligence.” It all sounded so much fancier because it was so-called
                        covert, you know. And it seems sometimes to carry more weight than it
                        probably should have, particularly in that case where it was being somewhat
                        soured because of our too-close relationship to the Greek government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I think there's a certain fascination on the part of a number of people
                    with the James Bond syndrome. I think you're absolutely right, Stu, that there
                    are people who tend to look on covert intelligence as something special. I'm
                    just reading a history of the intelligence business since World War I, and it's
                    fascinating the way a number of political leaders have become totally enamored
                    of their intelligence apparatuses and have come to rely on them to an excessive
                    degree as the source of all that is true and beautiful. Generally it has not
                    helped.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Even the CIA daily intelligence summary that goes to the President and other top
                    officials is based over 50% on overt diplomatic reporting, and that's a small
                    part of the total flow in competition with all the NSA intercepts and all the
                    overhead satellite photography and all the human resources collection through
                    covert means. Diplomatic reporting is still over half of the content. So all
                    that stuff doesn't necessarily produce great breakthroughs. Clearly it provides
                    information of a type that you cannot get through going around to the foreign
                    ministry or going down to the union hall and talking to people. None of this
                    will give you a picture of where the army is actually spread out in maneuvers
                    and what they're doing.</p>
                <p>None of this will necessarily tell you what the terrorist organization is going
                    to do next week as these other sources can. But you've got to use them together.
                    You've got to use them in balance. I've known CIA people who played the game,
                    the same game as your colleague in Athens, who didn't tell you what his
                    information was or where he had gotten it, and nobody was willing to challenge
                    him because it was too secret to ask. So, I mean, it's a great game. You know,
                    “I know something you don't know. I can't tell you what it is, but you've got to
                    take my word for it, I'm right.” Come off it, guy. You can't tell me what your
                    information is, I treat it with a great grain of salt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, at least where you were, that there was an
                        effort to try to balance these off or that wasn't your task?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: No. But I was very impressed by the analytical capability, as I say, of
                    CIA. On the analytical side, they are an exceptionally bright bunch of people
                    who do very good work. As I say, CIA and INR I thought had the two most solid
                    bodies of analysts in the community. The NSA was working single source. They
                    were good on what they did, but they tried to do too much with it.</p>
                <p>DIA tended to have a fairly narrow and rigid military mind set, and when they got
                    into anything beyond order of battle analysis they tended to look a bit silly.
                    But I found you could generally rely on CIA, and I found, at least in the Stan
                    Turner period, that their analysis was honest. There have been reports that
                    under Casey there was an awful lot of rethinking of intelligence when the
                    Director didn't like the conclusions they came up with. But at least in Turner's
                    period, he would sit down with the analysts and the collectors at times when
                    there was a major subject. He would get 30 people up in his conference room, and
                    they would have an open discussion of what the hell was going on. Turner wanted
                    to hear all sides. The lower-level analysts were there and they could chip in.
                    They could say what they thought and tell the Director that they didn't agree
                    with the way that this was coming out. And national intelligence estimates would
                    be footnoted with disagreements. So, as I say, the product that I was seeing
                    then was honest.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To really a very productive period in your career, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: It was an interesting period. I spent four years in personnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there both at an interesting time, and you played
                        a good, solid role in that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Yes, we are fated to live in interesting times, as the Chinese say. I
                    had had a minor run-in with Personnel when I was staffing the National
                    Intelligence Tasking Office. As I say, I had gone over there at the Department's
                    request. The Department had asked if I would be willing to take this detail
                    because they thought it would be useful to have a State officer in this
                    position. They had promised me full support. I wanted a couple of State people
                    as part of the mix of the National Intelligence Tasking Office. I was drawing on
                    all agencies to put together a multi-agency group.</p>
                <p>I had been promised a State officer to be my Middle East guy. I had one officer
                    for each area, and I wanted people who understood the area so when they talked
                    to the analysts they would know what they were talking about. There's always a
                    problem because you get somebody from State to come over to CIA. This guy's got
                    to get a new clearance. So it took a couple of months, anyway. And just as the
                    guy was getting ready to report, the Department reassigned him to something
                    else. So I raised the roof with the late Nancy Rawls, who was then the principal
                    deputy, and Harry Barnes, who was the Director General.</p>
                <p>I went over and had a friendly, stormy meeting with them and said, “You know,
                    that's a hell of a way to deal. I go over there at your request. You promised me
                    full support. We agree on the guy I want. You pull him from me at the last
                    minute to send him off to detail in the Defense Department. That's dirty pool.”
                    They found me an outstanding replacement, and we moved him in fairly quickly.
                    But, again, there was a two-month delay because he had to go through the
                    clearance process. I guess because I was willing to go over and fight with them,
                    the next call I got from Harry Barnes was offering me a job, asking me if I
                    would come over and be the head of FCA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Foreign Service Career Development and Assignments which was the
                    largest office in the personnel bureau. It's about one-third of the total bureau
                    staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I actually went over there in January of 1980. Normally my detail
                    should have run through the summer of 1980. It was a two-year detail in the
                    intelligence community. In fact, the call must have come in the early fall of
                    1979 from Harry, and I said, “I can't. I can't walk out. We've got a going
                    operation here.” I said, “I think I could leave toward the end of the year if
                    you can identify a satisfactory replacement by then because I will not walk out
                    and leave the agency in a lurch. You know, you pulled somebody out on me, but I
                    won't walk out on them.” Because Ron Palmer was moving up to be Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary, and Ron moved upstairs, I think, in September. I think that's when
                    they wanted me to come over.</p>
                <p>So we went through the process of getting a replacement. The National
                    Intelligence Tasking Office was pretty much established and the procedures were
                    going and the staff was in place, so it was not a bad time for a turnover. We
                    identified a satisfactory replacement, a very good one, in fact, John Burke, who
                    had come back from Guyana and was later to go on to head the Freedom of
                    Information operation.</p>
                <p>I went over in January to take over FCA. It was a real learning process because I
                    had never been in personnel. But, as I said to Harry at the time, “I felt I had
                    an obligation to do this. Having gone through 25 years bitching about the
                    personnel system, I felt if I didn't take the job I lost my right to bitch in
                    the future.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were your responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Well, FCA is responsible for all assignments, for career development
                    advice, for tracking people so that their careers develop in a logical way, for
                    making sure that assignments are carried out in the balance of the interests of
                    the bureau or post and of the individual officer or staffer, that everybody's
                    interests are taken into account and balanced as best you can.</p>
                <p>What you've got is constant tension. You've got posts and bureaus that want x, y
                    or z, and you've got a, b and c who want the job and need it as the next logical
                    step in their career development. You try to be sure that a, b and c get good
                    jobs in their terms, and you that the post and the bureau get people who can do
                    the job for them, if not X, Y, and Z, then you persuade them that A, b, and C
                    really are just as good. That's an awful lot of everyday negotiating going on
                    and balancing of interests and trying to run a system that meets the needs of
                    the Service and yet will be perceived as fairly honest and equitable by
                    Department personnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might say, having served in Personnel on promotion
                        panels, too, that the personnel function, at least for the Foreign Service,
                        in the operational side, is much more important than it would be in any
                        other organization. For one thing, since we move around so much, whereas the
                        promotion system is fair, the assignment process is the key to promotion. A
                        person is immediately judged by the job they have, not by themselves. I
                        mean, this is a fact of life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>So if you get the right job, you get the promotion and you move up. Yet there are
                    only so many good jobs. How did you feel about the balance? I mean, there are
                    certain jobs that have to be filled, but they are basically dead-end jobs for
                    people.</p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: The best you can do is to try to insure that the people who get jobs
                    that are not terribly competitive for one assignment get something better the
                    next time, so that everybody has a fairly equal shot. It never works quite that
                    way. I mean, in the ideal world, if you had total control of assignments in the
                    central system and the central system were endowed with sufficient wisdom, you
                    would do it so that everybody had an absolute equal shot.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, your personnel are not totally equal in their abilities, and
                    some jobs at any given moment will be more critical than others. You may have to
                    go for the very best you can get for a job because it's a critical place at any
                    given moment, and maybe the person who really wants it and who needs it in
                    career development terms just isn't going to be able to do it that well. So you
                    have to take into account, again, the needs of the Service. The need of the
                    Service is to get each job done in the best possible way. We like to think that
                    everybody in the Foreign Service is a water-walker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A water-walker, you might say according to our
                        terminology, is somebody whose abilities are such that they . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: That they walk on water. That's right. Actually that they are
                    superhuman and divine and walk on water. But some of them, in fact, do get their
                    feet wet quite regularly, and some of them get wet up to the waist, and some of
                    them barely keep their noses above water. And you have to take their abilities
                    into account as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Sometimes people think that they've been discriminated against when they don't
                    get an outstanding job for which they really aren't as well qualified as one
                    might wish they were. I was in FCA for about a year and a half. One thing I was
                    able to accomplish, at least we institutionalized in a formal way the assignment
                    mechanism. We negotiated a formal labor-management agreement on the open
                    assignment system which had been operating under a sort of tacit agreement with
                    the union up to that point. So the individual protections were codified and
                    formalized.As I say, we were able to codify the open assignment system and
                    formalize it in a labor-management agreement which, I think, was important
                    because that was, in a sense, a legacy to leave that protected the individual to
                    a considerable extent against arbitrary treatment in the course of the
                    assignment process. It still doesn't guarantee people the jobs they want. I
                    mean, you can't guarantee everybody is going to be happy with every assignment.
                    But at least it provided a minimum level of protection against arbitrary
                    treatment, and I think that was helpful.</p>
                <p>When the transition came in 1981 after Reagan's election, Joan Clark was
                    designated to replace Harry Barnes as Director General, and Joan asked me to
                    move up and become the principal deputy. It happened that my predecessor had
                    done the same thing. So I moved up to the front office at that point.Harry ran
                    an interesting system. When one of the deputies was away, he used to move one of
                    the office directors up to sit in the front office just to get the feel for it.
                    So I had had the experience of sitting up there and playing deputy a couple of
                    times. Also Harry had what we used to call vespers. It was an evening meeting at
                    which he met with his personal assistants, his two deputies and the director of
                    FCA, who was sort of a third deputy without the title. We would meet every
                    evening at close of business and talk over what was going on and the directions
                    for the next day and for the coming weeks.</p>
                <p>So I had been involved in all the business of the front office right through that
                    period when the Foreign Service Act was being drafted and the bugs worked out of
                    it and all the rest. So I was really quite well prepared so that moving upstairs
                    was a very easy transition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about Harry Barnes, because Harry Barnes
                        has been one of the major players in the diplomatic field, I guess, for some
                        time. He was Director General at the time. How at that time did you evaluate
                        him, and how effective do you think he was within the Department of
                        State?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I find that a hard question to answer, interestingly, as I stop to
                    think about it. I don't have a clear impression of Harry's effectiveness. We
                    were taking a lot of interesting initiatives. I mean, Harry was an idea man more
                    than a manager. Harry tended to generate ideas and leave the day-to-day
                    management to others. Let's look at one of the problems. For example, I dealt
                    mostly with Ron Palmer, who was at that time the principal deputy, and we were
                    trying to run as equitable an assignment system as possible, and we kept getting
                    sort of undone by the front office yielding to pressure from one or another
                    assistant secretary or bureau to give them somebody they wanted even though we
                    didn't think it was a totally equitable assignment.</p>
                <p>So we kept getting overruled on issues. We had the impression, in particular,
                    that Ron wanted to be well-liked so that if an assistant secretary came to him
                    and said, “Look, I really have to have thus and so for an office director” or
                    “thus and so to go out to this post,” Ron would say, “Let me see what I can do,”
                    and he would tell us to do it. And Harry sort of let this happen. That level of
                    individual management Harry left to his deputies. See, Harry was primarily
                    interested in ideas, in structures. He supported us on the open assignments. He
                    wanted to run a totally honest system. He wanted the system to instill
                    confidence in the people it was serving, and he certainly saw it in those terms.
                    How effective he was in making it happen I find very hard to judge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the arguments in the personnel system has been that
                        the pressure from the various bureaus, particularly the assistant
                        secretaries and all from the European bureau, let's say, will say, “I want
                        so and so.” Well, the Director General or his deputy or her deputy, we'll
                        say, all of whom are looking forward to becoming ambassadors or having other
                        onward assignments are really very susceptible to pressure. Whereas, if you
                        put a civil servant in who could be doing that for 20 years, they might not
                        know the Foreign Service but at least they'd say, “Well, that's the way it
                        is, fellah!”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Well, I think George Vest, who is about to retire, put it correctly. He
                    (and another Director General before him, Carol Laise, is another notable
                    example) said directors general should be on their last assignment with the
                    intention of retiring out of the post. I think the ideal formula is to have a
                    respected senior officer who is planning to retire out of the post serve three
                    or four years as Director General. Neither fear nor favoritism; not looking for
                    any onward assignment and really doesn't care if he offends somebody in the
                    interest of running the system the way he or she feels it should be run. I think
                    George Vest has done a superb job.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a certain amount of prot�g�ism that develops
                        within the Department. I mean, people may be asking for the right person,
                        you have to have somebody for a job, but you also ask for prot�g�s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Oh, yes. Absolutely. When I was in the Deputy Assistant Secretary job,
                    there was constant pressure in favor of prot�g�s. Larry Eagleburger, who has
                    just come back, I'm sure is going to drive Personnel crazy. We've discussed this
                    on occasion. I know his views, and he knows mine. Larry believes you have to
                    identify the outstanding young officers and push their careers and all the other
                    people be damned. I kept saying to Larry, “That's fine for the couple of
                    officers you meet and identify, but there may be other officers just as capable
                    whom you don't know who are being seriously disadvantaged because you're pushing
                    your prot�g�s.”</p>
                <p>And Larry said, “Yeah, but the ones that I know are good are good! They've got to
                    get the advantages.” He was trying to push an old O-5, now O-3, at one point to
                    be a DCM in a small post. The guy had been a staff assistant. He said, “He's
                    very good. He needs it. It's the next thing in his development.”</p>
                <p>I said, “We won't put him on the list.” I said, “If you want to go talk to the
                    ambassador and get the ambassador to come in and insist that that's who he
                    wants, we can't stop you from doing that. We may cave in in the end to the
                    ambassador.” Because at that point there was no formal mechanism for DCMs. I
                    said, “But we're not going to put him on the list and recommend him for it. He's
                    too junior. That's not fair to him, and it's not fair to other officers who need
                    that as the next logical step in their careers.”</p>
                <p>A couple of times I argued with him. I know perfectly well it didn't do my career
                    any good because I've known Larry for years. We'd been staff assistants
                    together, and I think I made the mistake of thinking I could talk frankly to
                    him. But I know Larry was not supportive thereafter when my name came up for
                    things.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>A couple of other people who were involved in decision making on my onward
                    assignments were also people I had crossed. Along the way I said no to several
                    other people who could have had an influence. I had an argument with Chet
                    Crocker at one point about an assignment in the course of which we had some
                    fairly sharp exchange. Charlie Hill, who was then running the Executive
                    Secretariat, wanted to hand-pick secretaries, but they had just agreed to list
                    certain executive secretary positions on an open assignments cable for
                    secretaries coming back to Washington. That having been done, we couldn't then
                    deny it to a qualified bidder. But he wanted to hand-pick another secretary, and
                    he said, “You don't know how important these are!”</p>
                <p>“I know how important they are.” “But,” I said, “we're trying to run it on a
                    system. We've got a qualified bidder. We can't deny it to a qualified bidder so
                    you can hand pick somebody else.” These are all people who had an influence over
                    my future, and I'm sure it didn't help that I turned them down for things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it does show that within the system it doesn't mean
                        that there's a corrupting thing, but there is an ability to corrupt because
                        you can't tell somebody no as easily who is going to judge your career
                        later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Well, you can, but you pay a price for it, and I knew there would be a
                    price to pay for it. But there was only one way I could run a system, and that's
                    the way that I thought was honest.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we're talking about what?</hi>

                <p>STEIGMAN: This is the '80s. This was '81 to '84.</p>

                        a political or an economic officer, as the way to become an ambassador and
                        move on? It's the testing position.</hi>

                <p>STEIGMAN: Usually. Not always. I'm the exception.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Well, the problem with DCMs is that for many years a DCM was considered
                    to be one of the two positions that any ambassador could choose. An ambassador
                    essentially could have any available officer that he or she wanted as DCM and
                    any available secretary that he or she wanted as personal secretary. These were
                    the two positions in which there was considered to be total ambassadorial
                    discretion. It was about the time that I was leaving Personnel that we began to
                    put some limits on ambassadorial discretion and to send ambassadors lists of DCM
                    candidates. That was put in during the time that I was there.</p>
                <p>The formal committee mechanism to approve or disapprove came into place just
                    about the time I left. But we began making up lists of DCM candidates and
                    sending them to ambassadors. And we tried to be sure that we included at least
                    one woman on each list. But it was, nonetheless, the ambassador's choice from
                    the list. And I think that most male ambassadors were negative and probably most
                    female ambassadors would probably tend to say, “Well, you don't want two
                    women.”</p>
                <p>So I suspect that a number of female ambassadors—there weren't that many—would
                    probably pick the male DCM for balance, and most of the male ambassadors, I
                    think, probably felt uncomfortable with a woman DCM and picked males. So the way
                    the system was structured, that right of individual choices, when that choice
                    was left to ambassadors, tended to certainly operate to the disadvantage of
                    women in the Service. There was no mechanism to force women into DCM
                    positions.</p>
                <p>Now I would still argue that you would not do any woman a favor by forcing her
                    into a DCM position in opposition to the ambassador's wishes. The popular wisdom
                    has it that, “fifty percent of all DCMs fail.” It's never been proven to my
                    knowledge. It's never been documented. Nobody has ever done a serious study on
                    it. But the popular wisdom has it that about half of all DCMs essentially get
                    downgraded by their ambassadors for not having done the job the way the
                    ambassador wants.</p>
                <p>A lot of the problem, I'm sure, is a communications problem. Unless the
                    ambassador and DCM sit down and very carefully spell out the role the ambassador
                    wants the DCM to play, it's very hard for the DCM to satisfy an ambassador. One
                    ambassador wants a DCM who will be quiet, sit at home and manage the mission and
                    the DCM adopts a high-profile posture toward the outside community, the
                    ambassador may seethe about it and bad-mouth the DCM in the efficiency report,
                    but never have told the DCM in advance what he or she wanted. Supposedly this is
                    a problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Now my guess is that if you force somebody, male or female, on an ambassador, the
                    odds for failure go up even higher, that the ambassador's resentment of having
                    this person forced on him is going to be reflected at best in a lukewarm
                    efficiency report. Therefore, the DCM position, rather than being a stepping
                    stone to higher things, is going to be a millstone that drags down the officer
                    and dooms the career. I suspect that most women officers in the service
                    recognize this and would not want to be pushed into a DCM position unless the
                    ambassador genuinely wanted them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The awareness has at least been raised now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Sure. I have not read the decision. I don't know what the judge is
                    going to order the Department to do. But any judge who orders the Department to
                    place X numbers of women in DCM positions, I think is going to do the women a
                    disservice is my own sense unless they are genuinely wanted in those jobs. The
                    ambassador-DCM relationship is such a personal thing that there's got to be good
                    chemistry, and if the chemistry is wrong, I think it's a recipe for disaster
                    both for the officers and for the post, for that matter.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the other factor, looking for minorities,
                        essentially blacks? Was this part of your responsibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Only indirectly. The other deputy had the direct supervisory
                    responsibility for REE which is Recruitment, Evaluation and Employment. But I
                    was involved from time to time, and, in fact, I was the one who on behalf of
                    Personnel agreed to work out an agreement with the Equal Employment Office that
                    we would, in fact, reserve 20% of all junior Foreign Service officer slots for
                    minorities. We had set a 20% goal in order to try to bring the Service as a
                    whole up to a more representative character. Twenty percent is higher than the
                    minority percentage in the population, but we were trying to overcome the past
                    under-representation of minorities. I was the one who signed off on the 20%
                    thing.</p>
                <p>There were people in Personnel who thought I was crazy for it, but I thought it
                    was the appropriate thing to do. At that point, during the four years that I was
                    in Personnel, the recruitment effort was not as effective as it should have been
                    undoubtedly, but it was attracting a sufficient number of minority candidates so
                    that we could, in fact, achieve that 20% goal with qualified candidates.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Now I gather in the next couple of years after I left, whether it was a failure
                    of the recruitment effort or a loss of appeal of the Foreign Service or what,
                    that the percentage of minority candidates actually hired dropped substantially
                    below 20%. That goal was met during the four years that I was in Personnel. I
                    gather it ceased to be met by 1985-86. I can't tell you what happened after I
                    left, but I think it's appalling that it happened because the mechanisms were in
                    place and they simply had to be pushed.</p>

                <p>STEIGMAN: In 1981, I moved up with Joan as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    and remained in that position for three years until spring of '84.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Joan Clark became Director General when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: She became Director General in early '81 after the Reagan election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now in Personnel did you notice any change? I mean, you
                        were in the office dealing with the professional side of the Foreign Service
                        essentially, but did you notice any great change with a rather drastic
                        change in administration? How did it impact on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: The most dramatic changes were a sharply heightened suspicion of the
                    career service on the part of the political management, a dramatic rise in the
                    number of non-career appointments and, of course, we were also preoccupied with
                    the initial implementation of the Foreign Service Act, all of which came at
                    once.</p>
                <p>So we had a chronic problem during those three years of senior office surplus to
                    deal with which had multiple causes, and we were not getting an awful lot of
                    sympathy from the political leadership which really didn't think all that much
                    of the career service to begin with. Some of it is inevitable, I think, with any
                    presidential transition. A new administration comes in and says, “If these guys
                    worked loyally for the last administration, how can they possibly be loyal to
                    us.” They really don't understand the career service. They were, as you know,
                    quite vindictive about the people who had served in Central America which became
                    the ideological touchstone for the Reagan Administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>We've seen some of the spitting recently in the “Letters” column of the Foreign
                    Service Journal in Frank McNeil's article and the responses. But certainly it
                    was a much more ideological administration, one where you had to be a true
                    believer really to be acceptable. You saw it in a variety of ways. You saw it
                    even in somebody who was as knowledgeable about his area as Chet Crocker in
                    Africa. I never discussed it with him so I can't tell you whether this was his
                    motivation, but he certainly seemed to be deliberately excluding from major
                    policy jobs in Africa as he had the option to make appointments, people who had
                    worked on African issues under previous administrations. He seemed to be looking
                    for very able officers who did not know anything about Africa or African policy
                    in the past, and who, therefore, would accept the gospel according to Crocker as
                    the only possible gospel.</p>
                <p>We did an analysis at one point, for example, of the major ambassadorial
                    appointments in Africa over the first three or four years of the Reagan
                    Administration. The career people chosen for the major posts were all people
                    without prior African experience who wouldn't know enough to question Crocker's
                    judgment and decisions and policies. They were very able officers, but the
                    Africanists were being systematically excluded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Expertise goes down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: And this certainly seemed to be the case, for example, in Central
                    America where again some of the people chosen were knowledgeable in the area,
                    but a number of very able people who really knew the area thoroughly were
                    systematically excluded. You had people like, for example, Myles Frechette, who
                    had been one of the deputies or an office director and had been working on
                    Central America, really knew the area thoroughly, was due for an embassy, and he
                    was exiled to Cameroon. You know, that sort of thing. There was somebody else
                    later on in the Administration who was sent off to Algeria—this was in '84 I
                    guess—because they didn't want him anywhere near Latin America because he had
                    worked on it.</p>
                <p>So there was a devaluation of experience and knowledge and a substantial
                    upgrading of ideological loyalty and commitment. Ben Read had been the Under
                    Secretary for Management under Carter. Ben knew and understood the career
                    service. I mean he was a political appointee, a lawyer originally from
                    Philadelphia, but had been Executive Secretary under Johnson working for Dean
                    Rusk, and understood the Department. Ben was not the greatest of managers, but
                    at least there was an understanding of the career service. There was not an
                    instinctive hostility. There was a recognition that loyalty was a two-way
                    street. If you were loyal to the people underneath you, you could count on them
                    being loyal to you.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>What you got suddenly in the transition from Ben Read to Dick Kennedy, the first
                    Under Secretary for Management in the Reagan period, was “who are these people
                    are how are they going to try to cut my throat today?” Kennedy, who was a
                    nuclear expert from the NSC staff, was an even worse manager than Ben was. Ben
                    wasn't really a bad manager, but Kennedy was a terrible manager. He had a
                    special assistant who is still with him on the nuclear side, who is quite frank
                    in expressing his distrust of the career service, and his feeling that the
                    career service was sort of pampered.</p>
                <p>That was the attitude coming from above. So Joan Clark had a fairly difficult
                    tightrope to walk. Joan's a very conservative type, anyway, in terms of her
                    behavior, in terms of the way she operates. She's very good in the bureaucracy
                    but very low key. She doesn't make waves. She's sensitive to the instructions
                    coming from above and will not generally do strong battle with them. One has
                    seen this, for example, in her more recent career as Assistant Secretary for
                    Consular Affairs. She has had to go up and testify on all kinds of unsavory
                    things, these exclusionary visa policies and all sorts of bizarre things. Having
                    known Joan now for several years and having talked to her a little bit about
                    this, she doesn't believe in a number of these things, but she's very loyal and
                    she will follow the guidance from above. This is not somebody who is going to
                    make waves. So the career service in those early years did not really have a
                    strong defender either on the seventh floor or in the Director General's
                    office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The seventh floor in our jargon refers to what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: The Secretary and the principal deputies, right. There was no strong
                    defender up there at that point. As I said, Larry Eagleburger who was up there—I
                    can't remember whether Larry was up there initially or whether he came in
                    shortly afterwards—but Larry, again, is not strong for the career service in a
                    generic sense, but rather very much for Larry's view of the career service; that
                    is, Larry's prot�g�s should get the advantages. So you did not have a defender
                    up there of running an equitable system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might point out that we had President Reagan, who ran
                        for eight years basically attacking the career people in the entire
                        government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Yes, absolutely. And, of course, his first Secretary of State, Al Haig,
                    a very bright guy but not particularly interested in the management of the
                    Service or of the system, left that to his deputies. So you didn't get any
                    support. It was not, in fact, until George Shultz came in that you had a
                    Secretary of State who began to pay serious attention to the management of his
                    personnel resources and to really come out publicly in support of the career
                    service, to go up on Capitol Hill and fight for the career service. I think
                    Shultz was quite remarkable in that and made a real contribution. I think once
                    Shultz arrived on the scene . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came when? About '83?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: He came in about late '82 or early '83, I guess. But the change was not
                    immediately apparent. It took him a while to take hold. It was really, I guess,
                    in the second Reagan Administration that he began to become quite outspoken in
                    support of the career service. Again, after I left Personnel, but there was at
                    least some change in attitude at the top. Kennedy moved on. We got a businessman
                    from Chicago who came in as the Under Secretary for Management. He only lasted
                    for a year. He was frustrated by the career service. He couldn't make changes
                    the way he could back in his business. He couldn't control the people. He
                    couldn't hire and fire people the way he wanted to, and he was very frustrated
                    by it. He decided to go back. He was retired, anyway. He said he would go back
                    and spend his time worrying about the Opera Board. Jerry Van Gorkom. He was a
                    nice man, not instinctively hostile to the career service, but just frustrated
                    by the bureaucracy. So there was an awful lot of management drift.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We now have a new Foreign Service act which was the
                        Foreign Service Act of 1980. What was the motivation or what was the
                        imperative that got this act done first and then some of the
                        repercussions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: My impression is the motivation came primarily because the Civil
                    Service was being restructured. One of the biggest problems was that a Senior
                    Executive Service had been created, and in the course of looking at the
                    restructuring of the Civil Service, there was an awful lot going on on the Hill,
                    “Gee, we ought to look at the Foreign Service, too, and, maybe, do we need a
                    Foreign Service after all or should it just be part of the Civil Service? Should
                    Foreign Service people be folded in? Should they be part of the Senior Executive
                    Service?”</p>
                <p>I think it was partly to stave that off, to rebuild the Foreign Service nearly
                    parallel to the Civil Service with the Senior Foreign Service built into it,
                    that the changes were instituted. There was also a feeling that if the Foreign
                    Service was going to justify itself as a separate service, it was going to have
                    to be more up-or-out and less lifetime security. If you were just going have the
                    life security the Foreign Service previously offered, then in what ways was it
                    really different from the Civil Service? So it was made deliberately a more
                    competitive service with real thresholds, with a Senior Foreign Service that had
                    limited tenure, to justify keeping, I think, a separate service.</p>
                <p>I don't know whether they really had to go that far, but certainly Ben Read, Jim
                    Michel and Bill Bacchus felt they did as they consulted around on the Hill. That
                    was their conclusion that this was the only way to really ensure the future of
                    the Foreign Service as a separate entity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got there when it was a fait accompli.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Pretty much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But how comfortable did you feel with it as you looked at
                        it and were going to have to put it into operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I was reasonably comfortable with it at the time. I thought it was
                    legitimate to put a greater degree of competitiveness into the Service. I don't
                    think any of us foresaw clearly or accurately what the real implications of it
                    would be five to seven years down the line when this started to bite. I don't
                    think the information put out by the Department at that time was fully accurate,
                    not out of malice in any sense, but simply because I don't think we really
                    understood how this was going to play out.</p>
                <p>For example, in advising officers on the senior threshold, I think the
                    information that was provided to people who had to make a decision as to when to
                    enter the competition—there's a six-year window—once you declare yourself in
                    competition at the senior threshold, either you're promoted in six years or
                    you're retired. Most people signed up in the first year to compete assuming that
                    they would be promotable within six years. Some of them should have waited two
                    or three years. But we really didn't understand how that was going to happen and
                    why they should wait and what the numbers were going to look like and what the
                    impact of all these changes was going to be on promotion numbers.</p>
                <p>So many things were happening at once that I don't think we were really able to
                    evaluate all of it as effectively as we should have and provide people with
                    better advice. As I say, I don't think there was any malice. I think we just
                    didn't see what was going to happen. For example, I don't think we foresaw the
                    extent of the senior surplus that would develop as a result of the growth in the
                    number of political appointments, the raising of the retirement age from 60 to
                    65, so a lot of mandatory retirements stopped happening for five years, the
                    prospect of substantial salary increases which encouraged people to hang on so
                    long as you had a high-three annuity, if you hung on to those years, obviously
                    you've boosted your annuity substantially. I mean, nobody was leaving, and also
                    the economy wasn't in very good shape. There were very few jobs out there.</p>
                <p>So for all kinds of reasons we built the senior surplus. That had an impact on
                    promotion numbers, that made it harder to cross the senior threshold and people
                    who had signed up for six-year competition, assuming that they would be promoted
                    in four to five years which was the norm, suddenly found it was taking seven or
                    eight years and they just didn't have seven or eight years. They only had six
                    and they were out.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>When this came up, a number of people obviously have filed grievances and law
                    suits because they feel that they were misled by the Department. They were
                    misled in the sense of being given insufficient information, not of being given
                    wrong information. But the Department, in fact, was at the time reporting to
                    Congress under Foreign Service Act on its projections of promotions for future
                    years.</p>
                <p>The actual promotions fell short of the projections reported as estimates to the
                    Congress. So some of these people are arguing, I think with a degree of
                    validity, that, “Look, the only information we had to rely on in making our
                    promotion assumptions were the numbers that the Department itself provided and
                    the Department failed to meet those targets and that's why we didn't get
                    promoted.” I think they can make a case for an extension for a year or two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a very, very difficult time. Much of the pressure
                        came from young, middle level, eager political officer specialists who
                        always looked at everybody above them as dead wood, to get them out, and yet
                        very quickly they have become part of the dead wood.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Yes. They became part of the problem, not part of the solution. It's
                    interesting. I think you're absolutely right because the impact has been spread
                    fairly widely. Middle-level officers and senior officers have shared the pain of
                    the transition to the new system. I think the biggest loss under the new system
                    has been the loss of confidence in a career.</p>
                <p>I think whereas in your day and mine, you went into the Foreign Service with the
                    confident assumption that you had found your career, that you were secure in
                    that career until you were ready to retire so long as you performed well, that
                    you did not have to be the star who walks on water to survive to your own choice
                    of retirement date, but that as long as you were a good Foreign Service officer,
                    by God, the Service would repay your loyalty by assuring you an honorable career
                    until you felt it was time to retire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another part of this is that you could accept an
                        assignment you'd rather not, but you could say, “Well, I'll accept this
                        really for the good of the Service.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today, I take it, it's almost an outmoded phase because
                        the good of the Service may not mean your good.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Yes. Since people are now competing for survival first at the senior
                    threshold and then at several stages in the senior ranks when they run out the
                    limited time in class, assignments become critical. You're quite right, unless
                    you have an assignment in which you can be judged as not merely a good Foreign
                    Service officer but one of the outstanding Foreign Service officers, you risk
                    seeing your career come to an end. People are reluctant to commit time to
                    training. People are reluctant to commit time to out-of-agency details which
                    could be fascinating and broadening and very helpful.</p>
                <p>I gather people are reluctant to do anything that isn't considered mainstream.
                    And also people are cutting each other's throats to a greater extent to get the
                    jobs they feel will advance their careers. The sense of collegiality has been
                    lost. The sense of top-down loyalty has been lost.</p>
                <p>The sense, as you say, of doing things for the good of the Service, I gather, has
                    been seriously diminished if not lost. That is an unforeseen consequence. I
                    don't think anybody saw that it would do this at the time. I don't know how you
                    reverse that. Having built this structure, I don't know how you can now rebuild
                    a sense of loyalty when people's careers are constantly at risk. The junior
                    officer doesn't feel this quite so immediately. I mean, you come in, if you get
                    your tenure you've got 20 years ahead of you.</p>
                <p>To the extent that people come in in their early to mid-30s and are assured of
                    being able to stay in until their mid-50s, that may be good enough for a lot of
                    them, and you're getting a lot of very good people with that kind of background
                    who are going to have a very satisfying career and leave comfortably in their
                    early or mid-50s feeling, “Okay, now I can go do something else. I've had a good
                    honorable career. It's been fascinating.” I think you presumably will have more
                    people leaving for family reasons because the great unresolved dilemma is still
                    the two-career family, spouse employment.</p>
                <p>So I just think it's going to be less of a lifetime career, less of a family,
                    less of a sense that we're all in this together, and more of a sense of, “How do
                    I get ahead in this?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this brings up a question that I ask at the end of
                        all of these interviews. Andy, you, of course, are right in the middle of
                        this, but what do you say to young people—you must get this everyday—about
                        the Foreign Service as a career?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I still encourage people to try it. If they are interested in
                    international affairs, I encourage them to consider it as a serious career
                    option with the caveat that it is no longer a guaranteed lifetime career, that
                    it's not going to be right for everybody, that they may have serious problems
                    reconciling Foreign Service career with a successful marriage and family life,
                    and that they have to look on it as one among a series of possible options and
                    have to feel that they can leave it if it doesn't work out for them without a
                    sense of failure. They have to go in with their eyes open that this is a
                    job.</p>
                <p>It's not a guaranteed career. It's no longer as it was for many of us, I think,
                    sort of a vocation like the priesthood. It's a job, and most Americans change
                    jobs eight or nine times in the course of their working lives and change career
                    fields two or three times. So it's a job. Maybe it will work for you, and you
                    will stay in it, and maybe it won't. But don't feel bad if it doesn't work.</p>
                <p>Consider that it's been fascinating experience, you've had the opportunity to
                    live abroad, you've learned something from it. Take that experience and put it
                    to work somewhere else. And if it works for you so much the better. Then stay
                    with it.</p>
                <p>We have a lot of Georgetown kids who are going into the Foreign Service still,
                    good kids, and I'm very encouraged by this. The Foreign Service is still getting
                    quality applications and recruiting quality candidates, at least the ones that I
                    see. they are good, and they will be good Foreign Service officers. How long
                    they'll stay I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Andy, the last question. Looking at your time in the
                        Foreign Service, what gave you the greatest satisfaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: I can't pick out any single thing. But as I look back at five overseas
                    posts and several different jobs in the Department, a number of them had
                    particular highlights, had things that were particularly exciting about them.
                    The Congo in 1960 was seeing history in the making. Working for Dean Rusk for
                    two years was a unique overview of the foreign policy process working for an
                    absolutely wonderful human being. Three years in Paris were exciting. It was a
                    lovely, fascinating place to live.</p>
                <p>I had what I thought was the best job in the embassy because I was a one-man band
                    dealing with half the world. Nigeria was great fun because the Nigerians were
                    wonderful people to be with, lively, sophisticated. It was not an exciting time
                    politically in Nigeria, but it was an interesting place to be. And being an
                    ambassador was fun. Again, Gabon was not a terribly exciting place to be
                    politically, but the experience of running an embassy is an interesting one even
                    when it's not very much of an embassy. A year and a half with the intelligence
                    community was interesting. I used to tell people there it was the most alien
                    culture in which I'd ever worked which amused them but it was basically somewhat
                    true.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Personnel was fascinating but frustrating trying to make the system work
                    smoothly, honestly and equitably, not always successful, and as I say, I think
                    if you really cared to make the system run equitably, you should be prepared to
                    retire afterward which I hadn't expected to but I think it was the smartest
                    thing I could have done because I certainly blotted my copy book. And then what
                    turned out to be perhaps in some ways one of the most useful things I ever did,
                    I came over to Georgetown as diplomat-in-residence and found a new home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I want to thank you very, very much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEIGMAN: Stu, thank you. It's been fun.</p>
